This Library Carpentry lesson introduces people working in library- and information-related roles to using R and Rstudio when working on systematic reviews. In addition to the basics of R and RStudio, you will learn to use the litsearchr R package. 

`litsearchr` facilitates the development of a systematic search strategy, partially automating keyword selection from a set of search results and writing Boolean searches, including automating truncation of terms. 

This is an introduction to R and RStudio designed for participants with no programming experience. At the conclusion of the lesson you will understand what R and RStudio does and how to use the litsearchr package to advance your work with systematic reviews.
