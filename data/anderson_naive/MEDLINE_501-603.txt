AB The pervasiveness of American youth's exposure to alcohol advertising is well-documented, as is the correlational evidence linking such exposure to alcohol-related attitudes, use, and expectancies. While efforts to train young people to resist persuasive appeals are often made in alcohol education programs, little evidence exists concerning the effectiveness of such efforts. The present study (N = 83) found that recency of exposure to alcohol education classes and discussion of alcohol advertising in such classes predicts cognitive resistance (counterarguing) of such advertisements months or even years after class exposure. Age, gender, and ethnicity were statistically controlled. While females tended to counterargue the alcohol advertisements more than did males, there was no statistically significant difference in the impact of education on males and females.

AB Distilled spirits are the major source of ethanol consumption in Poland. Such concentrated alcohol is drunk quickly, especially in teenager groups who consider consumption of 250 or 500 ml of vodka during one hour or one hour and half as quite normal. For two years the New Years Eve party has been celebrated in the Main Market Square in Krakow. In 1995 unfavourable weather conditions had been observed for at least 14 days before the New Year's Eve night. During that night only 15 people-participants of the party were admitted to the Department of Toxicology. The aim of this study is to present the cases of poisoned people with ethanol during the last night of the year 1995. All the patients were young (10 poisoned patients were below 17 years of age), considerably low body temperature, and relatively low coma grade. 80% of the patients were admitted between 0:00 and 5:00 a.m. after 200 minutes since the moment they started to drink alcohol. Blood ethanol concentration ranged from 1.2 to 4.23 g/L and serum osmolality from 338 to 440 mOsm/kg H2O. Both ethanol concentration and serum osmolality progressively rose reaching the highest values in the group of patient with III coma degree (p < 0.001). All the cases of acute ethanol poisoning presented in the study had a good outcome, as patient were admitted at the Clinic in relatively short time after symptoms of poisoning have occurred.

AB Drinking alcohol is an accepted and pleasurable part of social life. Most adults have at least an occasional drink with friends and, apart from those who may abstain for religious and other reasons, many would expect alcohol to be provided at a family celebration or a party. Yet, as is well known, alcohol in excess can kill. As has already been highlighted by four major reports it can affect an individual even before birth, and is responsible for significant ill health and unhappiness, destroying careers and wrecking family life. Heavy alcohol consumption sometimes begins in adolescence. It is therefore important both to educate young people about alcohol so that they can take informed decisions and to protect young children from its harmful effects.

AB BACKGROUND: The paper is concerned with the use of epidemiological methods to measure the rates at which different strata of a defined population participate in community health promotion projects. The specific aim was to estimate the incidence rates of participation in projects sponsored by the Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation (Healthway), separately for sociodemographic and health-related behavioural subgroups.; METHODS: Data were drawn from Healthway sponsorship projects in 1992. Each sport, arts and racing project was associated with promotion of a health message and creation of a health promoting environment. The study used a two-stage sampling design. Thirteen of 57 large sponsorship projects and 30 of 129 small projects were selected. In the second stage, respondents were randomly surveyed from among project participants. A total of 4060 respondents aged > or = 10 years was sampled from the 43 selected projects. Population-based incident participants were estimated and were related to person-years at risk.; RESULTS: The total participation rate was 4.01 per person-year. The rate was very high at ages 10-14 years and thereafter declined with increasing age. Compared with the least socially disadvantaged 25% of population, the participation rate fell by around one-third in the medium and high disadvantage groups, but exceeded the baseline by a ratio of 1.85 (95% confidence interval: 1.57-2.18) in the most disadvantaged 10% of population. The effect was most pronounced at ages 10-19 years. Participation was higher in those who smoked, drank alcohol unsafely, reported sunburn and reported low consumption of fruit and vegetables. However, participation was reduced in people who were sedentary.; CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological methods can be used to evaluate the distribution of participation of a population in community health promotion projects. The Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation has been successful in reaching disadvantaged youth.

   separately for sociodemographic and health-related behavioral subgroups.
   Data were drawn from Healthway sponsorship projects in 1992. Each sport,

   respondents at least 10 years old was sampled from the 43 selected
   projects. Population-based incident participation were estimated and
   were related to person-years at risk. The total participation rate was
   4.01 per person-year in people or= 10 years old. The rate was very high
   at ages 10-14 years and thereafter declined with increasing age.
   Compared with the least socially disadvantaged 25% of the population,
   the participation rate fell by around 1/3 in the medium and high
   disadvantaged groups, but exceeded the baseline by a ratio of 1.85 (95%
   confidence interval: 1.57-2.18) in the most disadvantaged 10% of the
   population. The comparatively high rate of participation in the most
   disadvantaged group occurred only at ages  50 years and the effect was
   most pronounced at ages 10-19 years. Compared with the least
   disadvantaged 25%, the rate ratio in the most disadvantaged 10% of the
   population was 2.50 in the metropolitan area and 1.25 in the country
   regions of western Australia.  Participation was higher in those who
   smoked, drank alcohol unsafely, reported sunburn, and reported low
   consumption of fruit and vegetables. Epidemiological methods can be used
   to evaluate the distribution of participation of a population in

AB BACKGROUND: Exposure to tobacco and alcohol advertising has been associated with adolescent substance use. However, it is not clear whether favorable reactions to advertising are an antecedent to or a consequence of substance use. This study investigated relationships between adolescents' levels of susceptibility to substance use and their recognition and liking of tobacco and alcohol advertising.; METHOD: Eighth-grade students viewed pictures of tobacco and alcohol advertisements with brand names and identifying information obscured, attempted to identify the brand name and type of product being advertised, and rated their liking of the advertisements. Subjects were divided into three substance use status groups: nonsusceptible nonusers (have never used and do not intend to do so), susceptible nonusers (have not used but have not made a firm commitment not to experiment in the future), and users (have tried the substance).; RESULTS: Susceptible nonusers liked the tobacco advertisements at a level that was significantly greater than that of the nonsusceptible nonsmokers and comparable to that of the users. Liking of the alcohol advertisements generally increased with alcohol use status.; CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that tobacco advertisements ostensibly targeted to adult smokers may have the effect of recruiting new adolescent smokers.

AB BACKGROUND: This study was a first initiative to evaluate the application of social marketing theory (SMT) to increase attendance at an alcohol abuse education program for university residence hall students and to ascertain whether aggressive recruitment strategies are necessary as part of the stepped approach model (SAM) of service delivery.; METHOD: SMT and public health strategies that include focus groups, in-depth interviews, and intercept interviews were used to develop recruitment materials in a Test Hall. These new recruitment materials were introduced to the residents in the Treatment Hall (N = 727) and were compared to the Usual Care, Control Hall (N = 706) which received the recruitment materials normally provided to residents as well as to three Historical Halls separately and combined which had used the Usual Care recruitment materials in the past.; RESULTS: The Treatment Hall percentage attendance was significantly superior (0.001 < p < 0.05) in all comparisons. The percentage attendance did not differ significantly from marketing literature expectations. The projections for campus-wide attendance for residence hall students were between 207 and 243 participants and for nationwide attendance, 36,900 +/- 8,185.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the SMT and public health methods used are helpful in developing recruitment strategies and are an important initial step of the SAM and that a "minimal intervention" recruitment strategy is a cost-effective approach that can have a dramatic impact.

AB Bladderdysfunction seems to have an increasing frequency in infancy, and especially in children without obvious congenital organic or functional bladderdysfunction. The disorder seems is related with changes in our behaviour, that are stimulated by familial and social pseudo-reasons. Commercial interests and marketing play a major role. This leads to wrong dry-training, an exaggerated hygienic education, prudisheness, wrong toilet-posture, lack of time to void, post-poning, wrong drink- and void-pattern, wrong food-pattern and increasing constipation. Prevention is necessary by an adapted reeducation of parents ans society.

AB This paper presents an analysis of alcohol beverage advertisements appearing in weekly magazines and comics. Few studies have be undertaken on this sector of the mass media in Japan. The results are compared with those of a similar study in the United States. We also review alcohol advertisements on television and the drinking scenes shown in comics. On the average, Japanese magazines tend to contain fewer alcohol advertisements than American magazines. However, 18 (53%) in 34 weekly magazines contained alcohol advertisements showing that such magazines are an important medium for alcoholic beverage advertising in Japan. There were also alcohol advertisements targeting to particular populations, youths and women, which may be connected with the increase in drinking in these groups. Alcohol advertisements in the mass media should be monitored continuously as public health issue.

   employment, improving public and social security, and promoting national
   solidarity. The Chinese government will look forward to sharing the
   Chinese experiences with social development at the forthcoming UN World
   Summit on Social Development in March, 1995. Since 1980 a national
   program for economic development has been in force. Since 1949 and the
   founding of the People's Republic and particularly since 1978, many
   advances have been made. The Chinese government has been able to provide
   adequate food and clothing for a population comprising 22% of the
   world's population living on 7% of the world's land. Not only have basic
   living standards been met, but per capital disposable income has
   increased. Ownership of durable consumer goods has increased to the
   level of moderately developed countries. Radio messages reach about 80%
   of the population, and television reaches about 83% of the population.
   Family planning programs have promoted a balance among population with
   ecology and socioeconomic development. The rate of natural increase has
   declined from 25.83 in 1970 to 11.45 in 1993. The crude birth rate for
   the same period declined from 33.43 to 18.09. The crude death rate has
   remained at about 6-7 per 1000 population. The total fertility rate has
   been reduced to 2.0. Life expectancy has increased from 65 years to 70
   years. Illiteracy among the population 15 years and older has greater
   improved; the illiteracy rate among youth and adults was 7% in 1993.
   Environmental policies have brought industrial pollution under strict
   control. Sewage treatment plants have been built. Natural gas and
   centralized heating have been promoted. Sound agricultural practices
   have been promoted. Reforestation efforts have resulted in the planting
   of almost 10 billion new trees. 13.9% of land area was forested in 1993.
   600,000 sq km of eroded land has been reclaimed. Natural preserves (776)

Data were obtained from a sample of 1,346 students (50.9% males, 49.1% females), who were asked to indicate the amount of information (none, little, much) they had received from ten sources about eight categories of drugs. Among the findings: television is the primary source of information for all drugs, except inhalants, for which newspapers/magazines are the main source. Newspapers/magazines are of secondary importance for the rest of the seven categories of drugs. Teenagers are less likely to receive information from physicians/nurses and relatives than from other sources. Information based on personal experience is prominent concerning alcohol, cigarettes, inhalants and hashish/marijuana, and it prevails more among males than among females (p < .01). Females use school teachers as a source of information in all drug categories more than males (p < .01). There are differences in using various information sources among grades and types of places of living. Information based on personal experience with alcohol is notably correlated with that with cigarettes, whereas information based on personal experience with opiates is correlated with that with stimulants, hallucinogens and hashish/marijuana (p < .001). The mean number of sources of information used by the respondents is the highest concerning alcohol and the lowest concerning depressants. Implications for prevention are discussed.

AB We present a content analysis of 137 public service announcements (PSAs) focused on alcohol-impaired driving that aired nationally on U.S. television between 1987 and 1992. Our findings include the following: 1) Most PSAs were intended to reach an undifferentiated general audience, not necessarily those who are at greatest risk for driving after drinking. 2) Most PSAs were designed to create awareness of the problem of alcohol-impaired driving or to promote individual behavior change. 3) More PSAs were developed on the use of designated drivers than on any other subject. 4) About two-thirds of the PSAs included one or more celebrities who speak directly to the audience. Past media campaigns have tended to ignore the fact that people's behavior is profoundly shaped by their environment, which in turn is shaped by public policy. We recommend that future mass media campaigns against alcohol-impaired driving focus on building support for changes in institutional structures, public policy or law that will motivate, support, and sustain the efforts of individuals to alter their behavior. Television PSAs can play an important but somewhat limited role in support of this effort. Greater emphasis will need to be given instead to media advocacy strategies, including paid radio advertising. We further recommend that the principal organizations concerned about alcohol-impaired driving share their plans and develop a common communications strategy that will advance the public policy agenda proposed by the Surgeon General's Workshop on Drunk Driving.

AB We examined the relationship between childhood sexual, physical, psychological, and "multiple" abuse (i.e., abuse in more than one form) and comorbid Axis I and personality psychopathology among women with a lifetime history of bulimia nervosa (BN group; n =s 80) and a control group of noneating-disordered women (n = 40). Subjects were recruited primarily by newspaper advertisement. They participated in structured clinical interviews for diagnosis of Axis I and personality pathology, and they completed child abuse questionnaires in the interview setting. At odds with prediction, child abuse in various forms was not associated with the presence of lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders in general (i.e., 1 or more) or disorder classes in particular (mood, alcohol/substance use, anxiety) among BN subjects, although sexual, psychological, and multiple abuse were associated with the diagnosis of a higher total number of Axis I conditions. A history of psychological and multiple abuse (but not physical or sexual abuse alone) among BN subjects was strongly associated with the presence of personality disorder diagnoses, especially those in the "anxious-fearful" cluster (Cluster C). Finally, we found that when a personality disorder was present in addition to the Axis I conditions in question, significant relationships emerged between abuse and Axis I pathology, particularly for psychological and multiple abuse. In general, control group findings were in accord with BN group findings, indicating that our findings were not specific to eating-disordered women. Our results suggest that childhood abuse, particularly psychological abuse and abuse in multiple forms, increase the likelihood of lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders and personality pathology among bulimic patients. Eating-disordered women with a history of child abuse may thus represent a subgroup of patients requiring especially intensive intervention.

AB Data from a longitudinal study carried out in Dunedin, New Zealand, were used to investigate associations between alcohol consumption at age 18 years and alcohol-related mass media communications recalled at ages 13 and 15 years. The respondents' recall of alcohol-related mass media material were categorized as: commercial alcohol advertising, alcohol moderation messages or the portrayal of alcohol in entertainment. An additional media variable was the number of hours spent watching television. Non-media variables, such as peer approval of drinking, living situation and occupation (all at age 18 years) were also included in the analyses. The period between the interviews at ages 13 and 15 years saw an increase in the broadcast of commercial alcohol advertisements on television in New Zealand and this was reflected in an increase in the proportion of the mass media material recalled which was categorized as commercial advertising. At age 15 years television advertising, mostly for beer companies, was the predominant material recalled. No relationships were found between the commercial advertising and wine and spirits consumption, among either men or women, but young women who had watched more hours of television drank more wine/spirits. Among women there were two unexpected negative relationships between recall of alcohol in the media at age 13 years and beer consumption. However, among men there was a consistent positive relationship such that those who had recalled more alcohol advertisements at age 15 years drank larger quantities of beer at age 18 years.

AB Recruitment of program participants and development of appealing comprehensive alcohol abuse prevention programs is an exigent priority for university campuses due to the serious physical and emotional consequences related to alcohol consumption. A sample of 67 students from a large midwestern university completed a survey based on Social Marketing Theory (SMT) which was developed to improve recruitment and enhance the design of comprehensive alcohol abuse prevention programs. The results indicate that recruitment may be optimized by providing a flexible, convenient, low-cost program that encourages friends' participation, communicates alcohol-related risks and offers university credit or refund as participation incentives. The design of alcohol abuse prevention programs may be enhanced by emphasizing the positive outcomes of reducing alcohol consumption, improving the quality and quantity of alternatives to the social atmosphere connected with drinking, and soliciting respected opinion leaders (physicians and parents) to communicate alcohol reduction messages. This project is a first initiative to 'fill the gap' in the social marketing research literature by providing formative information pertinent to recruitment and design of alcohol reduction programs specifically for college students.

AB The high alcohol consumption and increasing abuse of other addictive inducing substances in Central Europe calls for broadley conceived preventive programmes and cheap and widely applicable therapeutic strategies (early treatment at the first contact level, self-help manuals, self-aid organizations). Social instability along with greater availability of alcohol and drugs create a dangerous combination. In addition to strategies of stress prevention at the societal level also strategy at the individual level is important (e.g. relaxation training, yoga, psychotherapy). It is also important to change the "image" of western society and commercial interests of those who make profits on alcohol and drugs should be under control and advertising should be greatly restricted if not prohibited. Prevention of problems caused by alcohol and drugs in particular in youths must be combined and really effective strategies should be used such as peer programmes. The authors mention also their own preventive programme FIT IN and print materials oriented specifically on certain population groups.

AB The method of transcutaneous sanation of pancreatic pseudocysts under control of USE and CT has developed quite widely in the recent years and is applied in clinical practice. In the period from 1987 to May 1993 thirty-three patients underwent transcutaneous drainage (TD) of pancreatic cysts at the Burdenko Facultative Surgical Clinic, MMA; a total of 35 procedures were performed. In all cases TD was conducted under control of USE and roentgeno-television (RTV) by Seldinger's method or with various types of stylet catheters. The transperitoneal approach was preferable in cysts of the head, in cysts of the body of the gland hze transgastric approach was used under control of gastroscopy for later attempt to accomplish transcutaneous cystogastrostomy. Contrast examination of the cyst immediately after puncture revealed its connection with the pancreatic duct (PD). Fistulography was repeated every 5-7 days. In the absence of a cystopancreatic fistula the cyst was sclerosed with 96 degrees ethyl alcohol. Complications were encountered in 11% of cases and a recurrent cyst developed in one patient. The TD method under control of USE and RTV is effective in the treatment of pancreatic cysts attended by a low incidence of complications. A large size of the cyst, its infection or connection with the pancreatic duct are not contraindications for TD.

A secondary analysis of the NLS indicated a substantial decrease in the prevalence of heavier drinking between 1984 and 1985 which is attributed to the order of presentation of two differently styled questions regarding heavier drinking.

The two most important goals of this population were improving self-esteem (50%) and family relationships (43%). In contrast, smoking cessation (17%) and avoiding problems with alcohol (4.3%) were listed 14th and 19th priority, and were desired by only 56% and 61%, respectively, of those who needed help in these areas. Differences between soldiers' health goals and health needs must be considered when designing successful health-promotion programs.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study examined associations between religious variables and alcohol abuse and dependence among 2,969 North Carolina residents aged 18 to 97 who participated in the 1983-1984 National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area survey at its Piedmont location.; METHODS: Six-month and lifetime prevalence of alcohol disorders were compared among participants reporting varying levels of religious activity. Data were collected on frequency of Bible reading, prayer, and church attendance; time spent watching or listening to religious programming on television or radio; importance of religion; religious denomination; and identification as "born-again" Christians.; RESULTS: Recent and lifetime alcohol disorders were less common among weekly churchgoers and those who considered themselves born again. Recent, but not lifetime, alcohol disorders were also less common among respondents who frequently read the Bible or prayed privately. Alcohol disorders were more common among those who frequently watched or listened to religious television and radio. Lifetime, but not recent, alcohol disorders were more prevalent among members of Pentecostal denominations.; CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal study is necessary to further clarify and explain these relationships between religious practices and alcohol disorders.

Sugars eaten as part of a meal do less harm to teeth than those eaten frequently as snacks. Sugar-free infant drinks and children's confectionery are now on the market and are more "tooth friendly". Look out for the "happy tooth" symbol. Babies can be registered with NHS dentists as soon as the first teeth start to come through, and should be taken regularly to the dentist throughout childhood. Under the NHS scheme, dentists are paid a capitation fee to provide continuing preventive care and treatment for children free of charge.

AB Current research is classified into different theoretical approaches, mainly economic deprivation theories, stress-related theories, gender theories and different psychological and sociological theories. The correlations between unemployment and ill-health are explained as a result of both selection and exposure. The societal consequences of youth unemployment have been studied in aggregate studies. The familial consequences is a neglected area, but there is evidence of increased illness as well as battering of wives and children. Almost all research has been focused on the individual and mainly on the psychological consequences. Consistent relationships are found between unemployment and minor psychological disorders. Few studies have included somatic health but the results indicate increased physiological illness, especially among unemployed girls. Increased health care consumption has been documented. There are evidence that unemployment is a risk indicator for both increasing alcohol consumption, particularly in young men. Unemployment is also associated with increased tobacco consumption, increased use of illicit drugs as well as deteriorated health behaviour. The mortality rate is significantly higher among unemployed young men and women, especially in suicides and accidents. Social consequences include increased risk of alienation, lack of financial resources, criminality and future exclusion from the labour market. As mediating factors social support, high employment rate, negative attitudes towards work and high possibility of control have been documented to have a protective effect on health. Research should now be directed towards more qualitative methods, based on theoretical models, in order to search for deeper mechanisms, mediating factors and explanatory theories of the unevenly distributed health in society, in which unemployment has been proved to be one important factor.

AB OBJECTIVES: The relationships between television beer advertising and drinking knowledge, beliefs, and intentions were investigated in a survey of schoolchildren. The research was guided by a theoretical model specifying that awareness of advertising, and not mere exposure, is necessary for it to have an effect on beliefs or behaviors.; METHODS: Participants were a random sample of 468 fifth- and sixth-grade schoolchildren from a northern California community. Data were collected in the home with a combination of self-administered questionnaires and structured interviews.; RESULTS: Nonrecursive statistical modeling indicated that awareness of television beer advertising was related to more favorable beliefs about drinking, to greater knowledge of beer brands and slogans, and to increased intentions to drink as an adult. The effects of advertising awareness on knowledge, beliefs, and intentions were maintained when the reciprocal effects of beliefs, knowledge, and intentions on awareness were controlled.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that alcohol advertising may predispose young people to drinking. As a result, efforts to prevent drinking and drinking problems among young people should give attention to countering the potential effects of alcohol advertising.

A2 The community center at the housing estate of St. Mellons in Cardiff,
   Wales, has two projects serving youth.  A physician and nurse make up a
   team operating family planning clinic at the youth center on Friday
   afternoons.  Local graffiti artists have created brightly colored
   posters to promote the drop-in center.  Teenagers come to the youth
   center to play pool, drink coffee, and to listen to music.  In a room
   next to this activity, the team distributes contraceptives (e.g.,
   condoms).  They also counsel teens about sexuality, relationships,
   self-respect, health, and disease.   They work to dispel any incorrect
   information that they often hear.  Counseling provides the teens correct
   information, which they can convey to their peers.  The director of
   family planning and well-woman services for South Glamorgan finds peer
   education to be more effective than sex education in schools.  A
   psychiatric nurse and her community drug colleagues set up a drop-in
   center for a needle exchange, but the team finds itself acting as a
   drugs information service.  The advice it gives includes ho to use drugs
   more safely, possible adverse reactions, referrals (medical,
   detoxification, and counseling), and the nature of substances on the
   street.  Clients trust the team so much that they share with the team
   members when there is a bad drug on the market.  An outreach worker has
   headed up a residential week-end with some teens to further discuss drug
   use.  Despite their success and popularity, lack of financial or human
   resources prevents expansion of both service.  The drug needle
   exchange/information service tried to work out of another youth center,
   but fear by neighbors that it would give the area a bad name hampered
   its opening.

AB The differential effectiveness of same- versus opposite-sex role models in persuading teenagers to reduce alcohol consumption was investigated. Based on an actual set of commercials, four 1-min videos were constructed, in which either boys or girls discuss how alcohol adversely affects either boys or girls. These were shown to either teenage boys or girls, resulting in a 2(Sex of Source) x 2(Sex of Subjects [Ss]) factorial design. Ss rated the credibility of the source, the persuasibility of the message, said how much and how often they drank currently, and whether they intended to decrease their future alcohol consumption. Three studies were conducted, in a coeducational (N = 95), boys' (N = 98), and girls' (N = 102) school, respectively. The overall pattern in the data showed that as predicted, same-sex role models were more effective, and that moderate drinkers were more influenced than heavy drinkers; both findings having implications for teenage health education campaigns.

A2 Photo-comics are an ideal format for education of South African youth
   about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) given their low literacy
   rate and the widespread popularity of comic books.  An example of the
   success of this strategy is "Roxy:  Life, Love, and Sex in the
   Nineties," a comic produced as part of a school-based AIDS prevention
   program run by the National AIDS Research Program.  The comic tells the
   story of an adolescent girl who learns her friend committed suicide
   because she was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
   Roxy learns about AIDS and discusses the risk factors with her friends.
   Focus group discussions were used to generate story ideas and pretesting
   of the comic book took place among several student groups.  By July
   1993, 30,000 copies of "Roxy" had been distributed to students,
   churches, youth groups, civic associations, and organizations working
   with street children.  In addition, the comic was reproduced in a
   magazine, "Upbeat," that is popular among out-of-school youth.
   Qualitative evaluation through 8 student focus groups revealed that
   young people from various cultural backgrounds strongly identify with
   the themes, characters, and situations depicted in "Roxy."  Of
   particular significance were the realistic portrayals of romantic and
   sexual relationships, relationships with parents, and dilemmas posed by
   pressures to use drugs and alcohol.  The comic includes a sex education
   chart with concise condom use instructions.

AB Polyalcohols represent the most important group of sugar substitutes. Those most widely used in products advertising dental benefits compared to their sucrose containing homologues are sorbitol, mannitol (hexitols), xylitol (pentitol), maltitol, lactitol (12-carbon polyols), Lycasin (hydrogenated starch hydrolysate) and Palatinit (mixture of two 12-carbon polyols). All these polyalcohols have been proven to be non-cariogenic or extremely low cariogenic in rat caries experimentation, and some of them also in human clinical caries studies. They have also been shown to be non-acidogenic or hypoacidogenic in plaque pH telemetry. The low or non-cariogenicity of the above polyols can be termed a "passive" feature, because it is based on the fact that they are not, or only poorly and very slowly, fermented by the oral flora. More recent research, however, has also propagated "active", i.e. bacteriostatic and/or cariostatic properties of xylitol or mixtures of xylitol with other sugar substitutes. Such claims have not yet been substantiated in human caries trials.

AB Changes in smoking and drinking behaviour in relation to policy and economic variables were investigated among Dutch secondary schoolchildren in two measurements. The response rate was 82% during the second measurement. In bivariate analyses the policy variables 'pressure by tobacco advertising' and 'incorrect knowledge about dangers of tobacco consumption' and the economic variables 'money' and 'free availability from parents' predicted weekly smoking (among all respondents), and 'the experienced anti-smoking campaigns' predicted weekly smoking (among non-smokers during the first measurement). Only the economic variables predicted weekly drinking. A general and a specific theory of different mechanisms were designed to investigate whether these predictors are independent of other influences. We assumed that changes in smoking and drinking behaviour are predicted at three levels: (a) previous behaviour, (b) socio-demographic variables and (c) possible causes and intermediary factors. In multivariate analyses, only the prediction of weekly smoking by 'experienced anti-smoking campaigns' and weekly drinking by economic variables remained significant. The findings are relevant when policy priorities are developed.

The group consisted of 71 women and 29 men. Single status, abuse, and previous suicide attempts occurred frequently as did suicide among first-degree relatives. The most frequent reason for a suicide attempt was conflict with partners. In comparison with the normal population in the same catchment area, the patients were alone and felt lonely, but no difference was found in the group's relation to the labor market. After a four-year follow-up period, 9 persons had died by suicide. Borderline personality disorder and affective psychosis, no employment, 2 or more previous attempts, violent method and potential lethal attempt proved to be predictors of suicide later on. Alcohol and drug abuse, lack of social support and loneliness did not influence the risk.

The prevalence of medical diagnoses was high. Smoking was reported by nearly twice as many unemployed as the reference population. Heavy alcohol consumption was more prevalent in the unemployed men. Blood pressure was lower than in the reference population. Cholesterol was higher in the unemployed women. Many needed counselling or referrals. Having a medical diagnosis reduced the chances of re-employment two years later. Thus, health-related selection for re-employment seems to explain some of the excess morbidity among unemployed people.; CONCLUSION: The long-term unemployed is a group with high morbidity and unhealthy lifestyle. General practitioners should be aware of this pattern in clinical and preventive work.

According to the producers it should be a quick and simple method giving a high correlation between the alcohol level both in blood and saliva. As advertised, a drunken driver could estimate his own extend of alcohol impairment by himself. We checked the reliability of this method by comparing the alcohol level in the blood with the extend of colour change of the sticks in 20 adult volunteers engaged in drinking tests. 85% of them demonstrated distinct discrepancies. In most cases the saliva concentration estimated was too low. Those, depending on the result of this test kit, take a high risk of being misled and can probably assume sobriety in contrast to their actual state. A warning concerning this test is necessary.

The data were collected from children (ages 9 to 12) and teenagers (ages 13 to 17) in central locations (usually shopping malls) located in 100 primary sampling units across the United States. The analysis, which primarily employed stepwise multiple regression for model estimation, reinforced the importance of friends use, perceived risk, and tobacco and alcohol use in predicting marijuana use. An exposure model, which included antidrug advertisements, was a particularly powerful model. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To understand better the relationship between adolescents' use of the mass media (including television, radio, and magazines) and their risky or unhealthy behaviors.; DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of a 1987 in-home survey of 2760 randomly selected 14- to 16-year-old adolescents in 10 urban areas in the southeastern United States.; MEASUREMENT: The extent of participation in eight potentially risky behaviors (sexual intercourse, drinking, smoking cigarettes, smoking marijuana, cheating, stealing, cutting class, and driving a car without permission) and the use of a variety of mass media.; RESULTS: Adolescents who had engaged in more risky behaviors listened to radio and watched music videos and movies on television more frequently than those who had engaged in fewer risky behaviors, regardless of race, gender, or parents' education. White male adolescents who reported engaging in five or more risky behaviors were most likely to name a heavy metal music group as their favorite. Adolescents reported reading a wide diversity of magazines, and most reported reading at least one of a few selected magazines. Sports and music magazines were most likely to be read by adolescents who had engaged in many risky behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: Mass media health promotion efforts could more specifically target adolescents who are engaging in multiple risky behaviors.

AB Despite considerable progress, tobacco use continues to be a major public health problem in the United States, killing more U.S. citizens each year than alcohol, cocaine, crack, heroin, homicide, suicide, car accidents, fires, and AIDS combined. There is cause for particular concern about smoking and other tobacco use by children. Although adolescent smoking declined in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the combination of a now-flat daily smoking prevalence rate among high school seniors, high smoking rates among high school dropouts, and increased use of smokeless tobacco argues for renewed efforts in tobacco use prevention. The greater risk associated with tobacco use at early ages suggests the need for comprehensive interventions (i.e., involving policy change, advertising restrictions, health professionals, and comprehensive school health education) before the prime age for tobacco use initiation (i.e., 12 to 14 years old), for repeated reinforcement of these interventions through adolescence, for innovative ways of reaching underserved--particularly high-risk and minority--youth with effective tobacco use prevention efforts, and for research to determine both the short-term and the long-term effectiveness of these approaches.

AB Blast trauma within the oropharyngeal cavity may be associated with superficial or deep injuries. Superficial injury generally needs only observation; deeper injury that violates the retropharyngeal space may produce dissecting emphysema into the neck and mediastinum followed by prevertebral soft tissue infections and mediastinitis. Injury involving the parapharyngeal space might damage vital cervical vessels. Life-threatening complications may result unless treatment is adequate. Three children who sustained oropharyngeal blast injury are presented. The direct cause was the blast effect of a new, spoiled, orange-flavor beverage just released on the market. The bottle cap of the soft drink and its effervescent liquid "exploded" into their mouths while they were trying to open the bottle with their teeth. Obviously, the failure to observe due precautions, as frequently happens among children, contributed to the occurrence of the accidents. This paper describes the diagnosis, management, and relevant educational and preventive measures of the problem.

AB The methodology for an information campaign is discussed, detailing follow up in five stages: (1) assessment of needs: a good knowledge of behaviour patterns and the kind of information needed is the basic element to create the concept of a campaign. A pre-survey is an indispensable tool to secure this information; (2) basic scientific information: communication to the public has to be based on precise and recent scientific data; (3) comprehension of the information: communicating with the general public should be through texts that are clear and accessible to the greater part of the population; (4) production of supporting documents: each element of the campaign has to produce an impact on the person receiving the message; and (5) evaluating the impact of an information campaign. An evaluation can check whether objectives have been reached, and also correct errors and help prepare the next campaign even more professionally. These five stages are essential to set up a successful information campaign. We also give examples from our magazines Cancer-info and Smoke Buster-info. Through information public opinion can be mobilized to influence political decisions in the public health sector. One evidence for the importance of collective influence on political decision makers is our campaign to promote the total ban on tobacco advertising. As large-scale information campaigns need important financial resources it is essential to balance the cost to generate sufficient funds to finance further projects in the health sector; we discuss this matter as well as the impact on the image of the association.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB This study investigated sleeping habits, difficulties in being able to fall asleep and their connections to self-reported health conditions, as well as other selected health behaviours and use of leisure time, among 11-16 year old Europeans from 11 countries. The study was part of a larger, comparative, WHO coordinated project on the health and life-style of school children (Health Behaviour of School Age Children--A WHO Cross-National Survey, The HBSC Study). In most of the countries, research data were collected from samples representative of the whole country. Using a standardized survey questionnaire, the data were collected anonymously in schools. Altogether 40,202 students responded to the survey. Sleeping habits and an inability to fall asleep varied significantly between countries as well as between age groups but only slightly between the sexes. Finnish school children experienced the most difficulty in being able to fall asleep. After the Israeli youth, the Finnish school children had the shortest night's sleep. At least a fifth of Finnish and Norwegian school children also reported that they felt tired almost every morning, the corresponding figure being smaller in other countries. A frequent use of psychoactive substances (alcohol and tobacco), lack of physical activity, excessive watching of TV/videos together with numerous evenings spent outside the home were all connected with going to bed late as well as with frequent difficulty in not being able to fall asleep. The results of the study offer an important challenge to health promotion and health education. Much more attention must be paid to this essential and exciting health habit!

A2 The remarks of Filipino Senator Leticia Ramos Shahani are summarized
   from her speech delivered in the Philippine Senate chambers on August
   19, 1992.  She also responds to 17 questions on family planning issues.
   In addition to her high-level international background with the UN, she
   also was Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1986 and has been an
   active proponent of family planning.  A number of bills have been
   introduced by her for an AIDS center, protecting spouses from sexually
   transmitted diseases, provision of benefits for single parents and their
   children, prohibiting teenagers from appearing in advertisements for
   liquor and cigarettes, and other bills which enhance women's status.
   Over the next 6 years, she plans to continue to go to selected provinces
   to ensure the cooperation and commitment of local executives to family
   planning (FP).  The country will be helped because there is a President
   and a Health Secretary who are strong supporters of FP.  Although her
   background is in policy making, she was aware that deficiencies exist in
   training FP workers, assuring adequate supplies of contraceptives, and
   providing sufficient information and education.  FP should be directed
   to spacing and limiting births and helping with infertility in a
   friendly atmosphere.  Postponing marriage to an older age should be
   encouraged.  Working before having children, to ensure economic support,
   needs to be encouraged.  FP must be voluntary and without coercion.
   People have a basic right to information on FP and human sexuality.
   Support for FP does not mean support for abortion, which is illegal and
   prohibited by the Catholic Church.  Hopefully, knowledge about FP method
   will prevent the high number of illegal abortions.  There is more
   support now in the legislature for FP.  The Senator continues to promote
   her "moral recovery program."  The program emphasizes that people must
   have the right values concerning discipline, hard work, love of country,
   and sense of common good.  FP is a moral decision of couples to limit
   the number of children, which affects the destiny of the nation.

Two examples from Victoria, Australia, show how coordinated legislative and voluntary sector action can have a substantial impact on public behaviour. The introduction and enforcement of strict drink-driving laws and speed limits backed up by forceful television advertisements produced a large reduction in deaths from road traffic accidents, the death rate in relation to the number of vehicles in 1991 being among the lowest in the world. Smoking has also declined in parallel with a phased ban on advertising and use of taxes from tobacco sales to replace tobacco sponsorship of sports and arts and fund health promotion.

AB Alcoholic beverage advertising in Australia is allowed provided it conforms with a Code of Conduct approved by the Media Council of Australia (a collective of media proprietors). This system, known as self-regulation, has come under increasing critical scrutiny. It is argued from a systemic perspective that research has been one factor that has led to this increased scrutiny of alcoholic beverage advertising. Important other factors include the advent of the Australian National Campaign against Drug Abuse (which crucially included alcohol on its agenda), some erosion of the alcoholic beverage producers political status, declining per capita consumption, and an increase in media reporting on alcohol and drug issues. By examination of five research reports recently released on alcohol advertising it is argued that, in order to influence policy makers in an area where there is substantial opposition to change, research must be deftly marketed, contain information of political relevance, such as opinion poll material, and be used as a lobbying tool. The role of researchers in this process is considered.

AB This paper describes the Under Pressure Program, an innovative communication-centered approach designed to involve Chicago public junior and senior high school students in considering the problems and prevention of adolescent substance abuse. The centerpiece of the program is a 30-minute live musical play, Captain Clean, which incorporates extensive postperformance dialogue and role play to explore the pressures and feelings of adolescents regarding substance abuse. This unique blend of live entertainment and applied learning techniques enables adolescents to understand the pressures they face and teaches them to make responsible choices, in addition to serving as a vehicle for effective school and community substance abuse intervention. By going beyond the 60-second "just say no" television and radio campaigns, the Under Pressure Program addresses the underlying causes of adolescent substance abuse. Students are engaged in active participation rather than the traditional "teach and preach." The goals of the program are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of live theatre in preventing and intervening in adolescent substance abuse, and (2) to examine the effectiveness of live theatre, via postperformance dialogue and role playing, in soliciting feedback from adolescents as to their own feelings about substance abuse and using school counselors and other available resources, and to build upon their recommendations for improving substance abuse prevention and intervention programs. The program is targeted at predominantly minority, low-income students who have been identified as "high risk." The Under Pressure format consists of four integral parts: faculty/staff community in-service: theatrical performance (Captain Clean); postperformance dialogue and role play; and student, faculty, counselor, and community follow-up.

AB A survey of cigarette smoking in Santo Domingo was conducted among residents of 499 households in two neighborhoods. Residents over 14 years old were classified as current smokers (34.6%), former smokers (11.3%), and never smokers (54.1%). Most of the 200 current smokers interviewed (83%) had started smoking by age 20, but over half (59%) were relatively light smokers, consuming < or = 10 cigarettes per day. Remarkably for Latin America, smoking was nearly as common among women (32.9%) as among men (36.3%). Over 90% of the interview subjects disapproved of smoking by adults, the practice being considered undesirable by most because of its effects on health. Most of the adolescents interviewed viewed smoking as a mark of maturity (82.3%) and as "in" among their friends (53.7%). Even though few respondents understood the specific nature of health threats posed by smoking, health was the single most important factor motivating cessation. Most of the current smokers (87.0%) wanted to quit, and over two-thirds (67.5%) reported making at least one serious attempt to do so. Tobacco industry figures show that between 1962 and 1988 the total apparent cigarette consumption of the Dominican Republic rose 3.7-fold. Most of that increase was the result of promotion by Philip Morris, which now dominates the Dominican market. At present cigarettes are heavily advertised without health warnings and are sold to minors without significant restrictions. Such activities should be of particular concern in this and other developing countries with high fertility rates and young populations.

AB Marketing techniques and tools, imported from the private sector, are increasingly being advocated for their potential value in crafting and disseminating effective social change strategies. This paper describes the field of social marketing as it is used to improve the health of the public. A disciplined process of strategic planning can yield promising new insights into consumer behavior and product design. But the "technology" cannot simply be transferred without some translation to reconcile differences between commercial marketing and public health. 
A2 While the administration of US President Bill Clinton is trying to
   reform the US health care system, less attention is being given to
   changing behavior.  The problems caused by excessive alcohol drinking,
   poor diets, and the use of tobacco products and other harmful substances
   often tend to be more related to a country's health status than are
   acute, short-lived illnesses.  Private sector-derived marketing
   techniques and tools are increasingly being used to create and
   disseminate effective social change strategies.  The authors describe
   how social marketing can be used to improve public health.  They draw
   from information obtained from major textbooks, conference proceedings,
   telephone interviews with more than 30 practitioners and scholars in the
   field, and data on the application of social marketing in maternal and
   child health and nutrition in developing countries, family planning in
   developing countries, the anti-smoking campaign in the US,
   cardiovascular disease risk reduction, and substance abuse prevention
   among adolescents.  Sections consider the historical convergence of

   social marketing to health; and limitations, caveats, and issues for the

AB The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention's Division of Communications Programs launched its Urban Youth Public Education Campaign in late 1990 to target African American youth in 14 cities with prevention messages about alcohol and other drugs. During the market research phase of the campaign, the Center sought to determine the extent inner city African American children are impacted by alcohol and other drugs and how widespread the use of these substances is among younger children. Is it rampant and universal, as some press accounts have it, or are the images portrayed by the news media, by popular movies, and by other communication outlets fueling harmful stereotypes? The campaign's market research consisted of in-depth reviews of the literature, of personal communications, conference proceedings, grant and contract reports, monographs, newspaper and magazine articles, and of national survey results, and the analysis of findings from focus groups conducted with 143 African American children living in several urban environments. Although information and conclusions gleaned from the market research revealed a longstanding trend of comparatively lower rates of alcohol and drug use by African American youth, also disclosed was a need for an expanded framework to address the problems of substance abuse within the African American community. An expanded framework acknowledges the dimension of substance use and abuse but also addresses three other dimensions--involvement, exposure, and victimization--that unfold as having major significance for this population of youth who live in urban, high-risk environments.

A2 In late 1988, a congressional committee chaired by the author (Democrat,

   male-oriented research bend of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
   NIH acknowledged the fact that most of its research focused on men, and
   promised that it would correct the problem.  However, two years later
   nothing had happened, which triggered a legislative initiative mandating
   the inclusion of women into federally funded research.  Another GAO
   analysis ascertained that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was not
   asking gender-specific questions of drug companies prior to their
   marketing drugs.  For example, FDA would never ask about the interaction
   of oral contraceptives or estrogen with any new drugs.  Adolescents have
   also been neglected, but the committee collected information from

   proposes that a pregnant adolescent does not need parental permission

AB Greenland is a considered high risk area for a self-sustained heterosexual HIV-epidemic due to rather relaxed sexual norms in larger segments of the population and a high incidence of sexual transmitted diseases. However, the prevalence of HIV-positives is still low. As part of a monitoring programme longitudinal studies of young peoples' knowledge and sexual behaviour has been established. This paper presents results from the second survey among all students in vocational training and all 10th grade students in the public schools. Previous studies were performed in 1988 and 1989. The present study which took place in April 1991 involved a total of 1201 students, or about 85% of all students in the target groups (95% among students present on the day of surveying). Data collection was based upon standardized self-administered questionnaires. The study showed better knowledge than previously but no marked change in sexual habits. The age of sexual debut even appeared to be decreasing. More than half reported a sexual debut before the age of 15. More than 20% reported 10 sexual partners or more within the last year. HIV has still not reached the young population in Greenland but when it happens the present sexual behaviour carries a high risk of a self-sustained epidemic. 
A2 Alarming proportions of teenagers in Greenland start to have sex early
   in life, sleep with multiple partners, and do not use condoms regularly.
   There is a rather relaxed attitude toward casual sex among the general
   population in Greenland.  There exists a commensurately high incidence
   of gonorrhea, syphilis, cervical cancer, and other sexually transmitted
   diseases.  8000 new cases of gonorrhea were diagnosed in 1987, but only
   2000 new cases have been diagnosed annually since 1990.  This latter
   incidence is still high for the total population of 55,000 which resides
   in scattered settlements along the west coast of the protectorate.
   Greenland is at high risk for a heterosexual HIV epidemic.  Thus far,
   Greenland has benefited by a late introduction of HIV to the society,
   lack of drug abuse, few opportunities for homosexual contacts, good
   communication and information systems, good schools, and good health
   care.  As of September 1991, 32 HIV-seropositives had been identified
   from a serosampled population of 18,000; 11 of the positives were
   female.  Studies of youth's knowledge and sexual behavior were conducted
   in 1988 and 1989.  This repeat study surveyed all students in vocational
   training and all 10th graders in public schools in April 1991 through
   self-administered questionnaires.  The group of 1201 student respondents
   represents 85% of all individuals in the target groups.  It should be
   pointed out that 10th grade is the last mandatory year of the elementary
   school system in Greenland and that 461 respondents were under age 18
   and 740 were 18 years or older.  83% had had their sexual debut.  Among
   the sexually experienced, 54% reported first having sex before the age
   of 15 years.  17% of males and 11% of females reported having more than
   10 sex partners in the previous year.  26% of males and 42% of females
   reported more than 15 intercourses per month.  Consistent or most of the
   time use of condoms was, however, reported by only 29% of males and 24%
   of females.  Compared to earlier surveys, the age of sexual initiation
   declined and respondents reported both a greater number of sex partners
   and a higher frequency of sexual intercourse.  Denmark, yet residing in
   Greenland.  These findings indicate that while 5 years of intensive
   education and prevention campaigns have succeeded in improving health
   personnel, teacher, and student knowledge about AIDS, no marked change
   has taken place in the sexual habits of the young.  It is, therefore,

AB The social influence models do provide some optimism for primary prevention efforts. Prevention programs appear most effective when 1) the target behavior of the intervention has received increasing societal disapproval (such as cigarette smoking), 2) multiple years of behavioral health education are planned, and 3) community-wide involvement or mass media complement a school-based peer-led program (45,46). Short-term programs and those involving alcohol use have had less favorable outcomes. Future research in primary prevention should address concerns of high-risk groups and high-risk countries, such as lower income populations in the United States or countries that have large adolescent homeless populations. The utilization of adolescent leaders for program dissemination might be particularly critical in these settings. A second major and global concern should focus upon alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. In many communities adolescent alcohol use is normative and even adult supported. Thus, young people are getting quite inconsistent messages on alcohol from their schools, from TV, from peers, and from parents. This inconsistency may translate into many tragic and avoidable deaths for young people. Clearly, in the area of alcohol-related problems, community-wide involvement may be necessary. A third direction for prevention research should involve issues of norms, access, and enforcement including policy interventions, such as involve the availability of cigarette vending machines or the ease of under-age buying or levels of taxation. These methods affect adolescents more acutely since their financial resources, for the most part, are more limited. These policy level methods also signify to adolescents what adults consider appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

A2 Previously divorced and remarried couples have a higher probability of
   divorce and decline in marital quality.  Models which have explained
   this behavior focus on:  willingness to leave marriage; selection;
   socioeconomic status; the remarriage market; and incomplete marriages.
   Each model is examined among a population of marrieds and remarrieds to
   distinguish attributes and the extent to which these attributes increase
   the probability of decline in marital quality or divorce.  Data were
   obtained from a sample of 2033 marrieds  55 years old who were
   interviewed over the telephone in 1980, 1983, and 1988 in the Marital
   Instability Over the Life Course Study.  Incomplete marriage was
   measured by whether and to what extent parents or parents-in-law made
   contact and the number of relatives that party was close to. Willingness
   to leave was based on attitudes to divorce and the ability to handle
   emotion and financial affairs if the marriage ended. Selection referred
   to poor marriage material (drugs or alcohol, criminal conduct,
   mismanagement of money, immature behavior.  Socioeconomic status was
   reflected in occupational status, educational levels, and income.  The
   marriage market was a measure of age, education, and religious
   differences.  Marital quality was examined in terms of happiness,
   interaction, disagreement, and divorce proneness.  Multiple
   classification analysis was used to compare attributes by marital
   history.  The methods of Kessler and Greenberg were used to examine
   changes in marital quality over time in first time marriages and
   remarriages.  The results indicate that individuals in remarriages have
   relationships with attributes which potentially lower marital quality
   and increase the probability of divorce.  When both individuals have
   prior marriage and divorce experience, there is even lower social
   integration, greater willingness to leave marriage, higher probability
   of marrying as a teen, lower socioeconomic status, and greater
   likelihood of age differences.  Remarriage variables and marital quality
   variables both showed linear relationships.  Remarriage variables and
   marital quality variables both showed linear relationships.  In the
   cross sectional analysis of the 1980 data there is a statistically
   significant relationship with attributes which potentially lower marital
   quality in 1980 indicates remarried persons are more prone to lower
   marital quality than people in first marriages.

This study is a breakthrough in the Christian, Druze, and Moslem sectors, since it is the first project in the "alcohol domain" among high school students from those sectors. The article presents the results concerning Christian, Druze, and Moslem adolescents' attitudes toward magazine alcohol advertisements. The results have implications for prevention efforts among adolescents from those three religions.

A2 Improved family and community support would prevent many youth in
   Nigeria from risk behavior including drinking alcohol, smoking, and
   using illicit drugs.  In Rivers State, 70% of secondary students have
   had at least 1 alcoholic drink.  Further, in Bendel State, 13% of 15-19
   year olds in the coastal region drink alcohol compared with 75% of those
   in the hinterland.  Since alcohol affects good judgment skills, this
   behavior is especially risky during rituals and social activities and
   causes accidents.  Youth who drink are likely to have unplanned and
   unprotected sexual intercourse.  Drinking during pregnancy is associated
   with miscarriages, low birth weight, and birth defects.  Despite the
   problems with youth and drinking, Nigeria does not have law restricting
   sales of alcohol to youth.  In Nigeria smoking was once predominantly a
   male habit but is now increasing quickly among women.  Most smokers 1st
   begin their habit when 18 years old.  Even thought he Nigerian
   government has restricted smoking in public places, it has not yet been
   effective.  Smoking has numerous negative effects such as lung cancer,
   other cancers, shorter life spans, low birth weight, prematurity, higher
   perinatal mortality, and more labor complications.  Moreover the tobacco
   and alcohol companies advertise widely using ingenious and persuasive
   promotions.  Youth are especially vulnerable to these slick promotions. 
   Cannabis remains the most common illegal drug.  Heroin use is growing
   among urban adolescents in Nigeria, however.  Nigeria also serves as a
   transhipment point for drugs to the US as well as a consumption point. 
   Drug use results in rising numbers of patients in mental hospitals and
   treatment centers.  A particular concern of drug use is transmission of
   HIV and hepatitis B via needles.  Smokers and alcohol drinkers are
   likely to also be drug users.  Families, government, and community
   organizations need to collaborate to prevent these risk behaviors among
   youth.

AB Crimes of violence are recorded increasingly frequently, including those involving health professionals. We reviewed records of violent incidents kept for a major Accident and Emergency Department over a ten-year period. Details were recorded in a Violent Incident Book by all grades of A/E staff, and separate records were kept by hospital security officers. A total of 407 incidents were recorded. Numbers, rank and sex of staff assaulted, types of assault, injuries received, weapons used and characteristics and disposal of perpetrators were recorded. Many were young males who had been drinking: others were regular attenders, of whom three subsequently died and one convicted of murder. Nurses and male doctors appeared to be at the greatest risk of assault and receptionists at the least risk. Recording of violent incidents and subsequent prosecution seemed inconsistent, and may have reflected the lack of a code of practice in this area. Suggestions are made about preventing, predicting and dealing with violence, and its aftermath, in the A and E department, including the use of security officers and closed circuit television, waiting room design, the recognition of body language and signs of alcohol or substance intoxication. The importance of staff support after an assault is emphasized, including immediate and long-term counselling, provision of legal advice, criminal or civil court action, victim support schemes and the workings of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Free legal advice for staff assaulted at work should be included in the terms of service of NHS staff.

The body mass index was similar for all types of dancers. More than half (60%) of the dancers used vitamin and mineral supplements, and 18% of the females reported irregular menstruation. Wide ranges existed in intake of foods from each of four food groups, caffeine, and alcohol. Printed media (magazines and books) were the primary sources of nutrition information.

   and whites living in Los Angeles County, California were compared with
   162 matched controls.  The study was limited to only people with no
   hepatitis infection and to non-Asians.  The risk of liver cancer for
   women who have used OCs for 5 years was 5.5 times higher than that for
   women who had never used OCs.  This risk was 3 times higher for women
   who had ever used OCs.  The data for women who were in their
   reproductive years when OCs 1st entered the market in the 1960s showed
   that the risk for 5 years of OC use increased to almost 30 times that of
   women who had never used OCs.  Even though estrogens were presumed to be
   the risk factor since they induce liver cancer in animals, no
   significant association was found between estrogens used in estrogen
   replacement therapy and liver cancer.  Overall, diabetics were at 3.3
   times the risk for liver cancer compared with nondiabetics.  People who
   had diabetes for at least 10 years had 4.3 times the risk and those
   dependent on insulin injections had 18.5 times the risk.  Cigarette
   smokers had a 2.1 times greater risk of liver cancer than nonsmokers.
   Most of the women did not drink heavily which showed the independent
   effect of cigarette smoking.  As of December 1991, these data
   represented the best data on OCs and cigarette smoking to date.  The
   risk for heavy drinkers of alcohol (80g of alcohol/day=9 cans of beer, 9
   glasses of wine, or 9 shots of spirits) was 4.7 times the risk of
   nondrinkers or light drinkers.  It is concluded that alcohol and/or
   cigarettes caused 56% of liver cancer cases in men and that cigarettes
   and/or OCs caused 54% of liver cancer cases in women.

AB During the period 1980 through 1989 a total of 1029 cases of fatal poisoning (638 men and 391 women) were examined at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark. In 68% of the cases death had been caused by drugs, whereas acute alcohol poisoning and carbon monoxide accounted for 15% and 14% of the cases, respectively. Alcohol was detected in more than half of the 1029 fatal poisoning cases, and in 42% of all cases the blood alcohol concentration was above 0.8 g/kg. In 57% of the cases death was categorized as accidental, only in 31% of the cases as suicide. Accidental deaths were especially predominant amongst drug and/or alcohol abusers. Propoxyphene was the drug found to have caused most fatal poisonings during the decade (30% of the drug-related deaths). Most of the propoxyphene-related deaths occurred during the early and mid-eighties. Barbiturate poisonings were quite frequent during the first half of the eighties. However, the number of deaths caused by barbiturates decreased significantly after 1986, when most barbiturates were withdrawn from the market. The number of deaths caused by narcotics and analgesics increased during the survey period, while no specific tendency was observed concerning antidepressants.

AB Warning labels are now required on alcohol beverage containers in the United States. Prior to the enactment of the warning label law, a random sample of adults in the general population of the United States were interviewed by telephone to assess baseline knowledge and support for the warning labels (n = 2006). This paper proceeds on the assumption that public support is crucial for sustained success of alcohol control policies such as the warning label mandate. We found that a vast majority (87%) of the respondents felt that alcoholic beverages should have warning labels about possible health hazards, with abstention as the most significant predictor of support. A majority of the respondents also felt that alcohol education, server intervention, treatment and counter-advertisement programs should be increased. A large minority felt that alcohol taxes should be increased store hours should be decreased, and the legal drinking age should be increased. Most respondents agreed that warning labels would not have much effect on heavy drinkers. When compared to responses to similar questions about alcohol control policies over the past 20 years, evidence supporting a conservative trend towards alcohol in the United States was found.

AB Earlier findings have suggested that marriage may provide protection from a variety of physical and psychological problems. In particular, numerous studies have demonstrated a consistent relationship between marital status and alcohol use. To examine this relationship more carefully, we performed a longitudinal analysis of data collected on the Youth Cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience. Four marital transition groups were constructed based upon marital status across a 3-year period: stably single, married year 3, married year 2 and stably married. Results of repeated-measures MANCOVAS performed on alcohol-use patterns across time as a function of marital-transition group supported the notion that individuals begin moderating their alcohol consumption prior to their actual transition to married status with the trend continuing into the first year of marriage. The data further suggested that this decline in alcohol use stabilizes shortly thereafter, apparently within 1 year after marriage.

The professionally produced announcements focused on drinking and driving. 52 subjects were assigned by classroom to either of two treatment groups or a control condition. Both treatment groups received the educational presentation but differed in that Group 2 was also exposed to the videotaped announcements. Effects of exposure were evaluated in separate measures of knowledge, attitudes, and alcohol involvement, using a pre-posttest design, with a 1-mo. follow-up. Analysis showed an effect of over-all program on knowledge at follow-up, but none on attitudes or alcohol involvement. These findings and their implications are discussed in the context of previous evaluations of alcohol education programs and media efforts.

AB In a longitudinal study of 1230 people aged 13-18 years from the Greater Oslo Area, the past-year prevalence of anxiolytic or hypnotic use was 10%, which is higher than previously reported. The majority gave therapeutic reasons as a motive for using these drugs. However, most of the use was unprescribed. The parents, and especially the mother, were the most important suppliers. A minority gave intoxication as a motive for using these drugs. In this group, the suppliers were mainly peers and the illegal market. Neither the unprescribed nor the prescribed therapeutic use show any association with use of drugs such as alcohol and cannabis. There is, however, a strong association between the unprescribed use of benzodiazepines by young people and by their parents. This suggests a pattern of learning and role modelling, which must be regarded as problematic for public health policy. Those who use the drugs to become intoxicated have particularly poor mental health, and they use many other drugs as well. This group probably runs a special risk of developing more serious drug abuse.

Cocaine users were distinguished from non-users by being more likely to be daily users of tobacco (odds ratio, 2.1; CI, 1.3-3.6) and alcohol (odds ratio, 3.0; CI, 1.7-5.6), and to have tried marijuana (odds ratio, 7.1; CI, 3.2-15.9), sedatives (odds ratio, 11.4; CI, 6.4-20.7), designer drugs (odds ratio, 17.2; CI, 9.2-32.2), amphetamines (odds ratio, 27.1; CI, 14.3-51.3), and heroin (odds ratio, 36.5; CI, 14.0-94.9). The odds of having tried cocaine increased with the number of different types of illicit drugs that the person had tried.; CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ever having tried cocaine was low among a sample of young adults selected to ensure an over-representation of illicit drug users. Cocaine users were more likely to have experimented with a variety of different types of illicit drugs. Only a minority of those who had ever tried cocaine were current users.

Of the college drinkers, 73.7% reported they were willing to participate in one or more alcohol interventions with minimal provider contact, compared with 48.5% who said they would participate in programs with high provider contact. Respondents preferred minimal-contact strategies (use of nonalcoholic or low-alcohol beverages, information pamphlets, cash awards, television programs, and mailed instructions) to high-contact approaches. Men were significantly more willing (ps less than .05) than women to participate in nearly half (11 to 21) of the alcohol interventions. Three measures indicative of motivation to control drinking were significantly associated with greater willingness to participate in nearly all strategies. This study also suggested that drinkers who were highly motivated to control their drinking did not prefer minimal-contact interventions over high-contact interventions.

AB The extent to which cigarette advertising contributes to increases in smoking has been debated by public health professionals and the tobacco industry. One aspect of this debate has been the degree to which advertising influences smoking among adolescents. Previous research suggests that there are significant relationships between measures of advertising and smoking. However, potential simultaneous relationships between these measures have not been addressed. Observed correlations may arise from the effects of advertising on smoking or from smokers' selective exposure to advertisements. This study examined relationships between cigarette advertising and smoking experimentation. Using environmental and psychological measures of advertising exposure, it was demonstrated that adolescents who experimented with cigarettes were better able to recognize advertised products than those who had not, a selective exposure effect. Conversely, subjects who were better at recognizing advertised brands were more likely to have experimented with cigarettes, an effect due to their exposure to cigarette advertising.

American Indians reported even stronger reliance on doctors than did Hispanic and Anglo students, and rated clinic nurses as much more important sources of health information than did the other two ethnic groups.  Females showed greater reliance on social sources and less on electronic media than did male students, and high school students relied more on print media and less on television, nurses and family than did younger children.  Students felt more knowledgeable about smoking, alcohol and exercise than about diet, the heart-blood system and cancer; however, American Indians felt less informed about smoking and alcohol than did Anglos or Hispanics.  These findings (especially when compared to previous results) suggest that effective health education programs must be tailored to particular populations and based on specific knowledge of their attitudes, behavior and environment.

AB United Way of America is known nationwide for its services as a coordinator of local fund raising activities designed to meet the needs of the local community. Each United Way has many local agencies that depend upon the fund raising efforts of the organization for a significant amount of their budget. The United Way of Horry County (UWHC) operates in this manner, and over the years they have raised a significant amount of funds to support local service agencies. The UWHC is now attempting to examine possible changes by embarking upon a study designed to measure among the public the degree of awareness of United Way and the services which they provide. A sample survey was conducted and data were collected via telephone solicitation from individuals selected randomly throughout the market area of Horry County. The study identified the four most important services as: emergency assistance such as housing, fire, flood, etc., senior citizens, health care services, and drug and alcohol abuse. Furthermore, the study indicated that services which need to be added to this list include AIDS research, aid for homeless, mentally ill, and elderly.

AB A sample of 1023 eighth and tenth grade students in small to medium-sized central Texas school districts was assessed to determine the amount of information they receive from ten sources about six categories of drugs. The amount of information males reported receiving about each drug category was significantly greater than what females reported, and the amount of information that eighth graders reported receiving about each drug category was significantly greater than what tenth graders reported. Television was the primary source of drug information for all categories of drugs except inhalants, for which friends and television were equally important sources. Parents and printed media (magazines or newspapers) were of secondary importance, followed by friends and teachers. Adolescents were less likely to receive drug-related information from experience, siblings, church, doctors, and police. The reliance on the mass media for drug information in smaller school districts is a pattern which has been previously observed in larger urban districts. This consistency suggests that mass media approaches to drug education are likely to be as effective in rural areas and smaller towns as they are among urban adolescents. Implications for television programming are discussed.

AB In Austria it is illegal to sell tobacco to young adolescents. A diverse sample of 358 narcotic addicts was investigated at the Psychiatric University Clinic of Vienna. Data were obtained from on site confidential interviews and a HIV-test was conducted. The individual drug use history was recorded and, interestingly, tobacco addiction was the first stage in starting a drug career. Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between onset of heroin use and HIV-1 infection. It is concluded that in Austria not only the availability nicotine and alcohol to young adolescents should be prohibited, but also their use should be punishable. Easy access to nicotine as in public restaurants or from automatic distributors, has to be withdrawn. Tobacco advertisements may drive vulnerable young adolescents to early nicotine abuse and this may be followed by addition to other drugs and diseases causing death, including AIDS. Socioeconomic data, as well as the methadone data are presented. 180 out of the 358 patients were on methadone maintenance. Methadone treatment offers a first step toward social rehabilitation for drug addicts who have been living as criminals on the fringe of society. Physicians have a clear responsibility to lead the effort on all fronts against tobacco, especially in view of the HIV epidemic.

The Israeli study used a set of 64 magazine alcohol advertisements from 10 countries and with the help of an open-ended questionnaire examined differences and similarities in the perception of Israeli and foreign advertisements by Jewish, Moslem, Druze and Christian teenagers. Each response was coded twice. The first code indicated the general tone of the response and the second code indicated its theme. The article presents selected general results and conclusions. The results have implications for designing alcohol abuse education messages and can aid alcohol advertisers interested in responsible advertising to find advertising standards suitable to each culture.

Eighty-seven (81.3%) respondents were successfully followed-up and collateral information was available for 54 (61.1%) of these. Results showed a higher proportion drinking above recommended limits at six months follow-up in the control group (78%) than in the groups receiving the manual (53%). There were no significant differences due to presence or type of telephone contact and poor use was made of the opportunity for telephone contact. Findings justify the widespread promotion of self-help materials as a means of assisting the natural recovery process among problem drinkers.

A total of 438 women and 383 men were asked to indicate their level of support of or opposition to nine different proposals designed to regulate alcohol. There was general support for all policies, which was strongly related to characteristics of respondents and type of policy proposed. Women were significantly more supportive of all items than were men. Marriage, older age and low alcohol consumption were also associated with support. Education and voter status generally were not. Policies and activities that serve primarily to protect youth received the strongest support. Restrictions and prohibitions such as limiting advertisements were less popular. The least support was expressed for increases in taxes on alcohol and for measures that would eliminate an existing practice such as prohibiting wine-cooler sales at convenience stores. The majority of respondents also indicated that they felt the individual, as opposed to the manufacturer or retailer, was responsible for problems associated with alcohol and should be the focus of intervention. Strategies for shifting the focus from the individual to environmental and regulatory control are discussed.

The intention was to estimate how likely Australia is to experience an epidemic of cocaine use if the availability of the drug was to increase. A sample of 499 young adults in which illicit drug users were overrepresented were surveyed. The results suggested that there was not a large untapped market for cocaine. In terms of risk and attraction, cocaine was perceived to be more like the traditional 'hard drugs' of heroin, stimulants and hallucinogens than the traditional 'soft drugs' of alcohol and marijuana. Only 5% of the sample were prepared to try cocaine if offered it by a close friend.

AB Analysis of significant trends in self-reported alcohol consumption by women is presented, using data from surveys carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in three Australian States: Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales. Three indices of alcohol consumption were used to characterize consumption in 1977 and subsequently in 1983 or 1985. Little change was observed in the proportion of women who consumed alcohol in the previous week, although significant increases were recorded in the average daily consumption of female drinkers in all three States. These overall increases reflect increased levels of consumption by younger women. Women aged 18-24 years in all three States, as well as those aged 25-44 years in South Australia, consumed more alcohol in the later survey than did women of the same ages in 1977. The proportion of younger female drinkers whose average daily consumption reached hazardous levels showed marked increases in all three States. Analysis of beverage choices in Western Australia and South Australia indicated that older women in both States were consuming significantly less beer, and that South Australian women aged 25-64 years were consuming less fortified wine than were women of the same ages in 1977. These decreases were overshadowed by significant increases in wine consumption in both States for all age groups, and by increasing spirits' consumption in the 18-24 year olds. Several sources of underestimation of consumption are cited. Observed trends are discussed in the light of changing social values, alcohol marketing strategies and the employment status of women. Likely short- and long-term consequences of the observed consumption patterns are predicted and the challenge to prevention strategies is highlighted.

AB Community leaders in Atlanta, GA, the Detroit and Lansing, MI, areas, and San Francisco, CA, participated in a demonstration of techniques to disseminate information and increase public awareness of the recommendations from the Surgeon General's Workshop on Drunk Driving, held in December 1988. Local officials worked with the Public Health Service's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, to educate and inform the public about the workshop recommendations as well as other alcohol-related concerns, and to encourage public involvement in their communities with the issue of alcohol-impaired driving and other alcohol-related concerns. With minimal assistance from Federal agencies and Washington-based health and public interest groups, the communities developed unique approaches to generating local television, radio, and newspaper coverage of an event that had originated as national news. The events demonstrated that, with minimal Federal resources and support, local groups can create media attention in conjunction with national news, and local media events can lead to successful community activism. The techniques can be applied by other community groups to gain sufficient news media attention to encourage the public to organize around issues of common concern.

AB A survey of 19 166 secondary schoolchildren aged 12-17 years in five Australian states, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory was undertaken in 1987 to determine the prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use. Current smoking (that is, smoking at least one cigarette in the last week) rose with age to 27% in boys who were aged 16 years and to 30% in girls who were aged 16 years. The prevalence of current drinking (that is, consuming one alcoholic drink in the last week) rose with age to 55% in boys who were aged 16 years and to 50% in girls who were aged 17 years. Compared with an identical survey in 1984, the prevalence of smoking among 12- to 17-year-old schoolchildren had fallen significantly. The prevalence of drinking alcohol among 12- to 15-year-old schoolchildren also had fallen significantly, but not to the same extent as that of smoking; no significant reduction was found in the drinking of alcohol among 16- to 17-year-old schoolchildren. These trends are encouraging, but a need remains for all states to enact tobacco-control legislation, including the prohibition of tobacco advertising.

Of these, more were for alcohol and supplements; fewer were for basic or extra-calorie foods. Hidden messages for females could imply beauty through fashion products, beauty aids, and supplements but with a nutrition slimming plan.

Four hundred thirty-eight women and 383 men were asked to indicate how much they favored or did not favor 29 policy proposals. Results showed that regulatory controls in all three areas were favored by the general public. Support was strongest for alcohol and tobacco controls, less so for high-fat food. Interventions designed to protect children and youths were most strongly endorsed, followed by restrictions on advertising and direct control over conditions of sale. Women favored all interventions more than men. There was a strong positive association between age and support for measures to moderate alcohol use. Individuals reporting least personal use of alcohol, tobacco, and high-fat foods were most in favor of control policies. The results of this survey indicate specific measures that might be most readily enacted and what segments of the population are likely to be most and least receptive.

AB In recent years leading authorities and organizations have been recommending policies to combat alcohol abuse. These policies range from restrictions on availability to curbs on drinking and driving. However, the policies have not been presented in any priority order, nor is it clear how acceptable they will be to the general public. This report sets out public opinion on 21 key policies and looks at recent changes in public support in this area. It shows that there are a wide range of policies on alcohol which are well supported by the general public. It seems that the vast majority of both drinkers and non-drinkers would like to see more detailed labelling on alcoholic drinks, further action in the area of drinking and driving, the promotion of alternatives to alcohol in pubs, a levy on alcohol advertising, bans on the sale of alcohol at a variety of sports meetings, more alcohol education in schools and stricter enforcement of the laws on under-age drinking. In addition, the survey reveals greater public support for restrictions on the promotion of alcohol and the introduction of random breath testing, than had been found one year previously. It is suggested that these findings could be used for setting an agenda on the implementation of policies to reduce alcohol abuse.

AB This paper presents an overview of theoretical perspectives applicable to the effects of television drinking portrayals on adolescent audiences, focusing on the influence of beer and wine advertising and entertainment depictions of drinking behavior. A critical review of survey research evidence indicates that alcohol commercials contribute to a modest increase in overall consumption by teenagers and may have a slight impact on alcohol misuse and drunk driving. There are no studies measuring the effects of entertainment programming on adolescents, but content analyses suggest the potential for increased prodrinking attitudes and behaviors. Policy implications for addressing the deleterious effects of televised drinking are discussed, and priorities for future research are identified.

AB Throughout the study group deliberations, there were issues that cross-cut all discussions and suggestions. While the focus of the conference was on television, it is not possible to talk about television without including advertising, cable, and independent stations as well as the networks. In addition, television cannot be discussed in isolation from movies, for with VCRs and television reruns, movies are an integral part of the television scene. A second theme that transcended most discussion was a reluctance to call upon external regulatory mechanisms to control what many see as the excesses of television. There was sensitivity and concern for striking a balance between safeguarding basic freedoms, on one hand, and assuring the health and well being of the nation on the other. In terms of specific recommendations, there were some key general agreements: 1. Need for Interdisciplinary Dialog. Repeatedly, concern was voiced on how little understanding there is among and between those who are primarily concerned with the health and development of young people and those who develop programs viewed by that population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB During a period of 2 1/2 years, every 3 months 221 different food items forming a "market basket" were purchased, prepared, and classified into 23 food commodity groups. The "market basket" was based on a study of the dietary intake of 18-year-old men. In the (homogenized) food groups, the contents of protein, fat, and available carbohydrates were determined as well as the fatty acid composition. The mean daily amounts of the macrocomponents (as a percentage of the mean daily energy value of the total diet) were 14% for protein, 35% for fat, 47% for total available carbohydrates, and 4% for alcohol. The total diet contained 24 gm dietary fiber. The fatty acid composition of the Dutch male adolescents' diet resembles the fatty acid composition of the Dutch "national diet" and the typical American diet: approximately 15% of total calories as saturated fatty acids, 5% as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and a polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio of 0.33. The results, as compared with the recommendations for a healthy diet, show that a decreased consumption of saturated fat, a higher consumption of PUFA, a higher dietary fiber intake, and a higher consumption of complex carbohydrates would be advisable for male Dutch adolescents.

A total of 807 completed interviews were conducted. The results indicated that while most parents viewed teen drinking (69%) and drinking and driving (65%) to be a prevalent, relatively few seem to be engaging in behaviors likely to influence this. Thirty-two percent said they never discuss drinking and driving with their children, and over 65% said they never talk to other parents about how to talk to their children about drinking and driving, nor have any interest in doing so. Although slightly more than half said they had family policies concerning drinking, less than 20% said there were penalties for violating these policies. Over 70% expressed their willingness to watch a special show on TV about how parents can talk to their children about alcohol. Parents of teenagers appear to be far more likely to think that their teen's friends drink and drive (36%) than they are to think that their teen drinks and drives (10%). The results of this survey indicate a significant lack of parental awareness of teen drinking and a denial of their own teen's involvement in it.

AB This paper outlines some of the efforts that have been taken towards the formation of a national alcohol policy in New Zealand and its relevance for prevention planning in New Zealand. Strategies on the availability, taxation, advertising, and shaping of attitudes towards alcohol are discussed from a public health perspective. Preventive advances in alcohol education and health-related promotions for adolescents are also described. A Maori perspective on health and a women's perspective on alcohol prevention are considered essential factors specific to the formulation of a New Zealand alcohol policy. The implementation of any alcohol policy will depend on the level of support achieved, not only at the national level, but also in the wider community.
