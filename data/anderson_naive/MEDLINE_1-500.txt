AB AIMS: To describe alcohol use and alcohol brand appearances in popular movies and estimate adolescents' exposure to this alcohol-related content.; DESIGN AND SETTING: Nationally representative, random-digit dialed survey in the United States and content analysis of alcohol depictions in the top 100 US box office hits each year from 1998 to 2002 and 34 top movies from early 2003.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6522 US adolescents aged 10-14 years.; MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of alcohol use and brand appearances in movies by Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating. Estimated exposure to minutes of movie alcohol use and brand appearances among US adolescents in this age group.; FINDINGS: Most movies (83%, including 56.6% of G/PG-rated movies) depicted alcohol use and 52% (including 19.2% of G/PG movies) contained at least one alcohol brand appearance, which consisted of branded use by an actor 30.3% of the time. These movies exposed the average US adolescent 10-14 years of age to 5.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4, 5.7] hours of movie alcohol use and 243.8 (95% CI 238, 250) alcohol brand appearances (5 billion in total), mainly from youth-rated movies. Exposure to movie alcohol content was significantly higher among African American youth than youth of other races.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol use and brand appearances are portrayed frequently in popular US movies (which are distributed world-wide). Children and adolescents in the United States are exposed to hours of alcohol use depictions and numerous brand appearances in movies and most of this exposure is from movies rated for this segment of the population.

AB AIMS: To examine the nature and extent of alcohol industry sponsorship of sportspeople, and its association with drinking.; METHODS: A purposive sample of participants (n = 1279) from various sporting codes were asked whether they personally, their team, or club received free and/or discounted alcohol or funding from an alcohol industry body (e.g. pub, brewery, wholesaler); how much they received; and whether they felt they should drink their sponsor's product and/or at the sponsor's premises. Drinking behaviour was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire.; FINDINGS: Alcohol industry sponsorship was reported by 47.8% of the sample. Of those sponsored, 47% reported receiving free and/or discounted alcohol products. In multivariate models, those receiving sponsorship at the individual, team and club level had AUDIT scores that were, on average, 2.4 points higher [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-4.09] than those who received no sponsorship. Receiving free and/or discounted alcohol (beta(adj) = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.01-1.88) and feeling that they should go to the sponsor's pub/club to drink (beta(adj) = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.85-2.98) were also associated with higher AUDIT scores. Provision of free or discounted alcoholic beverages was associated more strongly with AUDIT scores (beta(adj) = 1.56; 95% CI: 0.62-2.51) than other forms of sponsorship from the alcohol industry (e.g. provision of uniforms).; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol industry sponsorship of sportspeople, and in particular the provision of free or discounted alcoholic beverages, is associated with hazardous drinking after adjustment for a range of potential confounders. Sports administration bodies should consider the health and ethical risks of accepting alcohol industry sponsorship.

AB OBJECTIVE: This preliminary study investigated prevalence rates of multiple health-related behaviors (ie, tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; sexual risk-taking; nutrition/physical activity; overweight and dietary behaviors; sun safety) among 42 adolescents on active treatment for cancer, as compared with healthy adolescent norms.; METHODS: Health-related behaviors were assessed using the 2005 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, for which healthy adolescent norms were publicly available.; RESULTS: Adolescents with cancer reported significantly lower current and lifetime rates of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; fruit/vegetable consumption; physical activity; and dietary behavior, in addition to lower rates of lifetime sexual intercourse, early-onset sexual intercourse, and alcohol/drug use before last sexual intercourse, compared with healthy peers. Among those who have previously engaged in sexual intercourse, there appeared to be a trend toward increased partners, current sexual activity, and lack of protection at last episode of sexual intercourse. Adolescents with cancer also reported significantly higher rates of television watching compared with healthy peers.; CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents on active treatment for cancer are engaging in multiple health-risk behaviors, including sedentary behavior, poor nutrition, lack of sun safety, and sexual risk-taking (eg, multiple partners, lack of protection at last sexual intercourse). Health promotion interventions are needed during active treatment to facilitate the acquisition of good health practices as adolescents transition into survivorship.

AB Sexual behavior and substance use represent major threats to the health and well-being of South African adolescents, especially in light of the high prevalence of HIV infection in this population. However, there is currently a lack of evidence-based school programs designed to address health risk behaviors. The current study details the evaluation of HealthWise South Africa, a leisure, life skills, and sexuality education intervention for eighth and ninth grade students. We hypothesized that, compared to controls, HealthWise participants would have delayed sexual initiation, reduced rates of current sexual activity, increased use of and perceived access to condoms, and lower rates of lifetime and past use of multiple substances. Longitudinal data were analyzed using logistic regression of multiply imputed data. Results indicate that HealthWise was effective in increasing the perception of condom availability for both genders (OR = 1.6). As compared to HealthWise participants, control participants also had steeper increases in recent and heavy use of alcohol (OR = 1.4 [95% C.I. = 1.1-1.8], 1.6 [1.2-2.2], respectively) and recent and heavy cigarette use (OR = 1.4 [1.1-1.7], 1.4 [1.1-1.8], respectively). There were also several significant gender by treatment interactions, which are discussed. These results suggest that HealthWise is a promising approach to reducing multiple health risk behaviors among the population of school-going South African adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: Problems related to alcohol consumption are frequent, especially among the youth population. We analyzed advertisement as one of several modifiable factors with impact over alcohol consumption.; METHOD: The authors carried out a literature review within Medline, SciELO, PsychoInfo and Google Scholar databases between 1990 and 2008, retrieving studies with different approaches of the alcohol advertisement impact on consumption. Besides, a ' snowball' technique was applied to identify the most proficuous authors on the matter. Over a hundred papers were initially selected.; RESULTS: The overall set of papers indicate that factors such as exposition to the advertising and attractiveness of the alcoholic beverage advertising are related with greater expectation of future consumption and with a higher and precocious consumption of alcohol, specially among adolescents and young adults. Despite methodological difficulties, recent econometrical studies indicate that reduction and/or banishment of advertising would decrease alcohol consumption. We also consider issues about the neurophysiology of decision making process and the freedom of choice in the context of exposition to advertisements.; CONCLUSIONS: The current knowledge on the matter strongly suggests that a reduction of the exposition to alcohol advertisements impacts on its consumption, mainly among young populations.

AB AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cues that signal the alcoholic strength of a beverage on drinking rate in young social drinkers.; METHODS: In Experiment 1, two groups of young social drinkers (n=20 per group) consumed a lager-based drink containing either 3% or 7% alcohol-by-volume. The pattern of drinking behaviour was observed, and drinking time was recorded. Self-reported mood was measured across the session, and participants also provided ratings of the drinks' sensory and hedonic properties. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1, but used a within-subjects design (n=12).; RESULTS: In both experiments, participants took significantly longer to consume the 7% drink compared with the 3% drink, and the total inter-sip interval was longer for the 7% drink. These effects were most closely related to the participants' changing estimates of alcohol strength across the test session, alongside concomitant changes in various aspects of self-reported mood. Sensory and hedonic evaluations of the drinks did not affect drinking behaviour in either experiment.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the consumption rate of an alcoholic beverage can be modulated by its alcohol content, and that the perceived pharmacological effect of the alcohol serves as an effective signal to alter drinking behaviour.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the framing of alcohol consumption in the American adolescent drama series The OC.; METHOD: All 51 episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 of The OC were coded for visual and verbal references to beverage use on the level of the scene (n = 1,895) and on the level of the drinking act (n = 1,033). Subsequently, all episodes were analyzed qualitatively through an inductive frame analysis.; RESULTS: Although the public's perception of The OC is that alcohol was overrepresented in this series, the quantitative results show the opposite. The focus was on active consumption and solitary drinking of alcohol, but in absolute terms there were more nonalcoholic drinking acts. The OC represents a trend break, compared with earlier analyses of alcohol consumption in television fiction: More than half of all alcoholic drinking acts involved women, and almost one third involved adolescents. The qualitative frame analysis revealed two commonly used frames (alcohol consumption as an "obligatory outlet" and alcohol consumption as "escapism") and two less frequently applied frames ("celebrate without the sauce" and alcohol addiction as "sickness").; CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the concept of framing might contribute to this field of study by analyzing the underlying cultural frames that suggest how the receiver may interpret the consumption of alcohol in fictional television programs.

AB BACKGROUND: Substance use is quite common among adolescents. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of parents on their habits.; METHODS: The study sample was made up of all 13 to 15 year old schoolchildren from the island of Majorca and their parents. Information was collected, with validated instruments, on parents and adolescents alcohol intake, smoking, socioeconomic status, sports and television watching, as well as adolescents academic performance.; RESULTS: The study included 4,019 schoolchildren and 7,359 parents. Parents belonging to a low socioeconomic level was the principal variable related to parental influence on smoking children (OR=3.86, 95% CI: 2.30-6.48, p=0.000), drinking (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.40-2.54; p=0.000), failing courses (OR=6.37, 95% CI: 4.23-9.61; p=0.000), watching TV 2 hours/day (OR=1.97; 95%IC:1.69-2.29; p=0.000), and not practicing sports (OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.80; p=0.001). Additionally, the mothers drinking had an influence on the children's smoking (OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.24-1.51; p=0.002), and the parents smoking had an influence on the children's (boys, not girls) failing courses (OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.33-2.68; p=0.000). The corresponding habits in parents increased the probability that adolescents drank (OR=1.91, 95% CI: 1.43-2.51; p=0.000), watched TV 2 hours/day (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.68-2.29; p=0.000), and practiced sports (OR=6.67, 95% CI: 2.57-14.96; p=0.000).; CONCLUSIONS: A low socioeconomic level is associated with a greater risk of smoking, drinking, failing courses and not practicing sports in the adolescents. Additionally, the mothers drinking is associated with a greater risk of her children smoking and drinking, and both parents drinking is associated with a greater risk of their children doing so. The practice of sports and the time spent watching television by the parents have an influence on the corresponding habits in their children, but have no influence on the adolescents smoking or drinking.

AB BACKGROUND: Europe is the heaviest-drinking region in the world, more than 2.5 times the rest of the world's average. THE COMMISSION'S CONCLUSION: The cornerstone for the European Commission's action to decrease the alcohol-related harm of this consumption and the main emphasis for its work is the Alcohol and Health Forum, with its Task Forces on Marketing Communication and Youth-Specific Aspects of Alcohol. The Forum, which was launched in June 2007, aims to provide a common platform for all interested stakeholders. Forum members are invited to make commitments to reduce alcohol-related harm, in the form of a monitored and evaluated action plan. By 29 February 2008, 79 commitments have been provided by the members of the Forum.; APPRAISAL OF THE INITIATIVE: Taking into account the limited information available, the proposed commitments indicate few evidence-based approaches. A large majority of the summaries do not, or only slightly, address the relevance of their commitment and give no evidence of why their proposed action is important in reducing alcohol-related harm. Even fewer commitments mention indicators of effectiveness of the proposed actions or propose to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed actions.; CONCLUSION: While most economic operators in the Forum have resources to undertake actions which could be highly effective, they commit principally to educational programmes which have been found to be mainly ineffective. This, and the neglect of existing legislation, do not give reason for optimism on the impact of the proposed commitments.

AB AIM: This study examines the relationship between physical, socio-economic and social environments and alcohol consumption and drunkenness among a general population sample of drinkers aged 12-17 years. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASURES: The study was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. The design comprised two components: (i) environmental measures including alcohol outlet density, locality-based measure of willingness to sell alcohol (derived from purchase surveys of outlets) and a locality-based neighbourhood deprivation measure calculated routinely in New Zealand (known as NZDEP); and (ii) the second component was a random telephone survey to collect individual-level information from respondents aged 12-17 years including ethnicity, frequency of alcohol supplied socially (by parents, friends and others), young person's income; frequency of exposure to alcohol advertising; recall of brands of alcohol and self-reported purchase from alcohol outlets. A multi-level model was fitted to predict typical-occasion quantity, frequency of drinking and drunkenness in drinkers aged 12-17 years.; FINDINGS: Typical-occasion quantity was predicted by: frequency of social supply (by parents, friends and others); ethnicity and outlet density; and self-reported purchasing approached significance. NZDEP was correlated highly with outlet density so could not be analysed in the same model. In a separate model, NZDEP was associated with quantity consumed on a typical drinking occasion. Annual frequency was predicted by: frequency of social supply of alcohol, self-reported purchasing from alcohol outlets and ethnicity. Feeling drunk was predicted by frequency of social supply of alcohol, self-reported purchasing from alcohol outlets and ethnicity; outlet density approached significance. Age and gender also had effects in the models, but retailers' willingness to sell to underage patrons had no effects on consumption, nor did the advertising measures. The young person's income was influential on typical-occasion quantity once deprivation was taken into account.; CONCLUSION: Alcohol outlet density was associated with quantities consumed among teenage drinkers in this study, as was neighbourhood deprivation. Supply by family, friends and others also predicted quantities consumed among underage drinkers and both social supply and self-reported purchase were associated with frequency of drinking and drunkenness. The ethnic status of young people also had an effect on consumption.

AB This paper presents the methodology and results of the implementation of a Surveillance System for Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors in Adolescents. A random sample of 8th-grade students (n = 1,684) enrolled in municipal schools in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was studied. Students were asked to complete a confidential questionnaire on food consumption, physical activity, sedentary leisure-time activities, and tobacco consumption. Prevalence estimates of risk factors were calculated for the entire sample and by gender. Non-response rates ranged from 1.1 to 8.9%. The findings included low consumption of fruits (45.8%) and vegetables (20.0% and 16.5% for salads and cooked vegetables, respectively), regular consumption of soft drinks (36.7%) and candies (46.7%), extensive time on TV, computer, and videogames (71.7% spend at least 4h/day at these activities), low frequency of regular physical activity (40%), and 6.4% prevalence of smoking. Girls showed less physical activity and more smoking. The system appeared to be feasible and indicated high prevalence of risk factors for non-communicable diseases.

AB Based on voice-history data, a chi2 test was used to investigate the difference between students of acting (n = 45) and other students (n = 45). A t-test was used to calculate the differences in acoustic parameters between the two groups. It was expected that students of acting spent significantly more time practicing voice exercises, took more acting instructions, and generally spoke more in larger rooms and did warm up exercises (p < .001). However, it was not expected that they smoked more than non-professionals (p = .003), and that they drank alcoholic drinks as much as other students. Male students of acting had significantly lower f(0) SD means (p = .015), which means that they had a more stable pitch throughout phonation. Students of acting also showed a significantly higher Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) than other students (p = .001 for males; p = .01 for females). The data showed the importance of the appropriate use of voice, which reflected relatively good voice quality despite the bad living habits of the future professional voice users.

Respective online searches (PubMed, Medline) were negative.; METHODS: Relevant publications in Vietnamese were collected by the authors and translated. Visits to cancer centres and institutes of odontology (Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi) were made and seminars with respective scientists were held. Field excursions to local markets and interviews with betel quid vendors and individual BQ chewers gave further insights.; RESULTS: Generally, BQC is on the decline in Vietnam. 6.7% of the female population still seems to indulge in this habit. In an earlier study, a prevalence of 0.06% of oral cancer was reported. In a study of 1084 cases of oral cancer, the male:female ratio was 1.05:1 (1997). The age group between 60 and 75 years is most often affected by oral cancer. In BQ chewing women, the buccal mucosa (27.9%), tongue (23.1%) and lips (22.4%) are most often affected. Verrucous carcinoma is seen in the age group 70-79 years with women most often being affected (male:female ratio 1:3.4). The most important risk factor for oral cancer in women is BQC compared with men where smoking, alcohol drinking or combined smoking and drinking habits are the most common risk factors. Oral leukoplakia in BQ chewers is observed in 3.8%, oral submucous fibrosis in 13%.; CONCLUSIONS: BQC in Vietnam is on the decline. Association between BQC and oral cancer in elderly women is still of importance. Eventually, the BQC habit will vanish and only play a role in socio-ritual contexts.

AB Adolescents' alcohol-related attitudes and behaviors may be affected by marketing efforts of the alcohol industry, retailers, and the catering industry. Most research has focused on the effects of commercials and media exposure. This article investigates another aspect of alcohol marketing in the Netherlands: the use of alcohol discounts by cafes. The prevalence of alcohol discounts was studied using unobtrusive cafe observations and website content analysis. It is estimated that 39% of the cafes offer some kind of cash discount for alcoholic beverages. The effects of alcohol discounts were investigated in a survey among adolescents (14-17 years old, N=409). Adolescents reported using alcohol discounts eight times a year, and consuming more alcohol when discounts were offered. Alcohol discounts, however, do not attract adolescents to visit particular cafes and/or to spend more money when going out. No differences were found between minors (16-17 years) and underage adolescents (14-15 years).

AB OBJECTIVE: This article reports the extent to which children (0-12 years) and teenagers below the legal drinking age in Australia (13-17 years) were exposed to alcohol advertising on free-to-air television in Sydney, Australia, during the period from March 2005 to February 2006.; METHOD: Exposure levels were obtained from weekly Target Audience Rating Points (TARPs) data generated by OzTAM, the official Australian television audience monitoring system. (The TARPs figure for an advertisement is calculated based on the number of individuals from a target audience [e.g., 13- to 17-year-olds] exposed to the ad as a proportion of the total number of individuals within the target audience, multiplied by 100). Exposure levels were obtained for four age groups-up to 12 years, 13-17 years, 18-24 years, and 25 years and older-for 156 different ads for 50 brands.; RESULTS: Adults 25 years and older were most exposed to alcohol advertising: approximately 660 TARPs per week. The level to which underage teenagers (13-17 years) were exposed to alcohol advertising was virtually identical to that of young adults (18-24 years): 426 TARPs per week vs 429 TARPs per week. Children (0-12 years) were exposed to approximately one in every three alcohol ads seen on average by mature adults (ages 25 years and older).; CONCLUSIONS: This study found that Australian children and teenagers below the legal drinking age currently are exposed to unacceptably high levels of alcohol advertising on television. These findings suggest that alcohol marketers may be deliberately targeting underage adolescents. At the very least the findings highlight the need for action to be taken to reduce levels to which underage Australians are exposed to alcohol advertising on television.

AB OBJECTIVE: To establish the school eating habits of Mexican children, who are prone to obesity and later to high rates of adult chronic diseases.; DESIGN: Questionnaires for students and parents with staff questionnaires and interviews.; SETTING: Randomly sampled schools in a socio-economically representative district of Mexico City.; SUBJECTS: Subjects were 1504 adolescents aged 10-19 years attending schools in Mexico City, 27 teachers and seven headmasters, sampled from both public and private schools and from the full range of socio-economic groups.; RESULTS: Foods brought from home were of a higher nutritional quality than those purchased at school, where purchases were dominated by crisps, soft drinks and other items with high energy density. Girls were more inclined to purchase inappropriately; those from poorer homes purchased less. Private-school students irrespective of socio-economic grade brought more food from home and purchased more expensive food at school. School policies allowed food and drink vendors to market any products within the schools, which benefited financially from these activities.; CONCLUSIONS: Current school food policies are conducive to amplifying the current epidemic of obesity and related adult chronic diseases, and need to change.

AB Alcohol consumption among young people in New Zealand is on the rise. Given the broad array of acute and chronic harms that arise from this trend, it is a major cause for alarm and it is imperative that we improve our knowledge of key drivers of youth drinking. Changes wrought by the neoliberal political climate of deregulation that characterised the last two decades in many countries including Aotearoa (Aotearoa is a Maori name for New Zealand) New Zealand have transformed the availability of alcohol to young people. Commercial development of youth alcohol markets has seen the emergence of new environments, cultures and practices around drinking and intoxication but the ways in which these changes are interpreted and taken up are not well understood. This paper reports findings from a qualitative research project investigating the meaning-making practices of young people in New Zealand in response to alcohol marketing. Research data included group interviews with a range of Maori and Pakeha young people at three time periods. Thematic analyses of the youth data on usages of marketing materials indicate naturalisation of tropes of alcohol intoxication. We show how marketing is used and enjoyed in youth discourses creating and maintaining what we refer to as intoxigenic social environments. The implications are considered in light of the growing exposure of young people to alcohol marketing in a discussion of strategies to manage and mitigate its impacts on behaviour and consumption.

AB Travel-related poisoning is an emerging social and public health emergency in Bangladesh but its cause and significance have not been determined. To investigate this syndrome we performed a prospective clinical study and retrospective analysis of hospital records in a general medicine unit of a public tertiary care teaching hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using toxicological analysis by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS). The participants of the prospective study were 130 consecutive patients aged 16-80 years who were admitted with central nervous system depression (Glasgow Coma Score 3-14) after using public transportation, in the absence of other abnormalities, from January through June 2004, and a convenience sample of 15 such patients admitted during 3 days in May 2006. In 2004-2006, travel-related poisoning increased from 6.1 to 9.5% of all admissions (210-309 of 3266-3843 per year), representing 46.6-55.7% of all admitted poisoning cases. Incidents were associated with bus (76%), taxi, train, and air travel, or local markets; 98% of patients remembered buying or accepting food or drinks before losing consciousness. Direct financial damage (missing property) was diverse and frequently existential. Among 94 urine samples analyzed by FPIA, 74% tested positive for benzodiazepines. Among 15 urine samples analyzed by LC-TOF MS, lorazepam was detected in all; five also contained diazepam or metabolites; nitrazepam was present in three. FPIA results obtained for these 15 samples were below the recommended cut-off in eight (53%; lorazepam only). Our findings show that the massive medicosocial emergency of travel-related poisoning in Bangladesh is the result of drug-facilitated organized crime and that benzodiazepine drugs are used to commit these crimes, suggesting modifications to the local emergency management of the victims of this type of poisoning. They also highlight the need for more research in the neglected field of acute poisoning in Bangladesh, and for criminal investigations of the use of benzodiazepine drugs in this country.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the current situation of ten types of junk food consumption (assessed by World Health Organization) among children and adolescent as well as the contributing factors in Haidian District, Beijing so as to provide evidence for developing preventive and control measures and interventions.; METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the consumption of ten types of junk food practices in 1019 children and adolescent aged 8-16 years in Beijing Haidian District.; RESULTS: One month prior to the study, 97.50% of the children and adolescent had eaten at least one type of junk food and 15.88% of them had eaten all types of them. Rates on having eaten deep fried food, pickled food, processed meat products, biscuits, coke or alike drinks, convenience/fast food, canned food, dried or preserved fruit, cold and sweet food, barbecue food etc. appeared to be 70.43%, 60.14%, 79.72%, 64.24%, 69.63%, 78.72%, 42.16%, 51.95%, 68.13%, 60.14% respectively. The rate on eaten more than once a day of these ten types were 26.95%, 36.88%, 34.84%, 32.97%, 27.40%, 28.18%, 37.91%, 26.15%, 37.39%, 22.10% respectively. The rates for "do not like" and "dislike" these ten types junk food were 10.96%, 27.42%, 7.08%, 12.11%, 6.56%, 6.59%, 17.80%, 13.59%, 3.42%, 5.19% respectively. Most of the children and adolescent ate junk food mainly during breakfast at home. Most of the surveyed children and adolescent did not have correct idea on nutrition of junk food. They received the information of junk food mainly from sources as advertisement on TV (67.95%), mother (9.02%), newspaper or magazines (6.71%). Many factors, such as individual factors (including physiological and psychological situations), social factors, family factors and the characteristics of food contributed to the eating junk food practices of children and adolescent.; CONCLUSION: Eating junk food is a popular event among children and adolescent in Beijing Haidian District. Education strategies on nutrition should be developed and launched in order to help children develop their own healthy eating behaviors.

AB PURPOSE: To examine cross-sectional associations between credit card debt, stress, and health risk behaviors among college students, focusing particularly on weight-related behaviors.; DESIGN: Random-sample, mailed survey.; SUBJECTS/SETTING: Undergraduate and graduate students (n = 3206) attending a large public university.; MEASURES: Self-reported health indicators (e.g., weight, height, physical activity, diet, weight control, stress, credit card debt).; RESULTS: More than 23% of students reported credit card debt > or = $1000. Using Poisson regression to predict relative risks (RR) of health behaviors, debt of at least $1000 was associated with nearly every risk indicator tested, including overweight/obesity, insufficient physical activity, excess television viewing, infrequent breakfast consumption, fast food consumption, unhealthy weight control, body dissatisfaction, binge drinking, substance use, and violence. For example, adjusted RR [ARR] ranged from 1.09 (95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.17) for insufficient vigorous activity to 2.17 (CI: 0.68-2.82) for using drugs other than marijuana in the past 30 days. Poor stress management was also a robust indicator of health risk.; CONCLUSION: University student lifestyles may be characterized by a variety of coexisting risk factors. These findings indicate that both debt and stress were associated with wide-ranging adverse health indicators. Intervention strategies targeting at-risk student populations need to be tailored to work within the context of the many challenges of college life, which may serve as barriers to healthy lifestyles. Increased health promotion efforts targeting stress, financial management, and weight-related health behaviors may be needed to enhance wellness among young adults.

AB Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) continues to be the leading preventable cause of mental retardation in the United States. Because abstaining from alcohol prior to and throughout pregnancy is the only way to prevent FAS, some prevention programs try to target women before they become pregnant. The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Teaching and Research Awareness Campaign (FASTRAC) is a multimedia, peer-delivered educational presentation designed to reduce the incidence of FAS. Results from an ethnically diverse sample of high school students indicate that the program increased participants' knowledge regarding FAS but had no significant effect on participants' attitudes, beliefs about the dangers of FAS or intention to use alcohol during pregnancy. The FASTRAC program failed partly because of its didactic approach and the lack of health education principles that have been shown to be effective in changing other substance use behaviors. Suggestions for improving FAS prevention education programs are offered.

AB UNLABELLED: Social norms interventions are a common approach to addressing the problem of college student drinking. An increasingly popular but not yet well-validated social-norms-based intervention consists of providing normative feedback to students in small groups.; OBJECTIVE, PARTICIPANTS, AND METHODS: In this study, the authors used a randomized design to test an interactive form of small-group social norms correction with 502 first-year students during September and October 2001. Because the unit of random assignment was at the level of the classroom, the authors used hierarchical linear modeling to estimate variability. They investigated whether small-group interactive social norms correction could influence alcohol perceptions and behaviors above and beyond a noninteractive social norms education approach.; RESULTS: Results indicate that the approach has a fairly substantial influence on student perceptions; however, the findings do not support an influence of interactive small-group social norms correction on measures of alcohol use behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: Given these findings, the use of interactive small-group social norms approach to influence student misperceptions may be considered as a primer for population-level preventive interventions.

AB OBJECTIVE: The authors examined whether alcohol-related negative consequences decreased among students exposed to an intervention.; PARTICIPANTS: Beginning in 1999, approximately 2,500 randomly selected undergraduates from a 4-year US university annually participated in a Web-based survey over 6 years.; METHODS: The educational intervention used social norms initiatives. Main outcome measures included recall of intervention, estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC) when drinking, and 10 negative consequences from alcohol within the past year.; RESULTS: First-year students recalling exposure had lower odds of negative consequences (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64-0.95) and of having an eBAC higher than .08 (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.92). Over the 6 study years, the odds among all participants of experiencing (a) none of 10 alcohol consequences nearly doubled (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.82-2.49) and (b) multiple consequences decreased by more than half (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.36-0.50).; CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important implications for US colleges and universities engaged in the reduction of harm associated with alcohol misuse.

More than 50,000 students at 120 colleges took part in the study. This article reviews what we have learned about college drinking and the implications for prevention: the need to focus on lower drink thresholds, the harms produced at this level of drinking for the drinkers, the secondhand effects experienced by other students and neighborhood residents, the continuing extent of the problem, and the role of the college alcohol environment in promoting heavy drinking by students. In particular, the roles of campus culture, alcohol control policies, enforcement of policies, access, availability, pricing, marketing, and special promotions of alcohol are highlighted.

AB Underage drinking is a major public health problem. Youth drink more heavily than adults and are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of alcohol. Previous research has demonstrated the connection between alcohol advertising and underage drinking. Restricting outdoor advertising in general and transit ads in particular, represents an important opportunity to reduce youth exposure. To address this problem, the Marin Institute, an alcohol industry watchdog group in Northern California, conducted a survey of alcohol ads on San Francisco bus shelters. The survey received sufficient media attention to lead the billboard company, CBS Outdoor, into taking down the ads. Marin Institute also surveyed the 25 largest transit agencies; results showed that 75 percent of responding agencies currently have policies that ban alcohol advertising. However, as the experience in San Francisco demonstrated, having a policy on paper does not necessarily mean it is being followed. Communities must be diligent in holding accountable government officials, the alcohol industry, and the media companies through which advertising occurs.

AB Cigarettes with candy, fruit and alcohol flavors have been introduced in recent years as extensions to popular cigarette brands, raising concerns in the public health community that the enticing names, creative packaging, and intense flavorings of these products may be especially appealing to youth. This study used two national surveys to examine the prevalence of use of Camel Exotic Blends, Kool Smooth Fusion, and Salem Silver Label brands during 2004--2005 among older adolescents and young adult smokers aged 17-26 years and adult smokers aged > or =25 years. Overall use of any of these flavored brands in the past 30 days was 11.9% among smokers aged 17-26 years and 6.7% among smokers aged > or =25 years. A significant gradient in use was seen across age, with the highest rates of utilization among 17-year-old (22.8%) and 18-19-year-old smokers (21.7%) (p<.001). Uniquely flavored cigarette brands seem to be most attractive to the youngest smokers and should be prohibited.

AB This study explored the consumers' and vendors' perceptions about Mondia whitei roots, in Kampala city, Uganda; determined the marketing margins and the market flow of the roots in the city; documented demand and supply opportunities as well as challenges to marketing of the roots by the vendors. Seventy vendors and 70 consumers of the roots were administered with semi-structured questionnaires. Results showed that M. whytei roots are largely perceived as sexual stimulant, appetiser, flavours for food and drinks, and stimulant for milk production in lactating mothers. Majority of the vendors (74%) and consumers (85%) perceived the trade in the roots as worthwhile. Men and adolescent boys were reported to be the main consumers. Retailers who buy the roots directly from collectors and later sell to consumers dominate the trade. The average price charged per piece and a kilogram of roots increases from collectors, middlemen and to the retailers. The average retail price was US $0.12 per piece of the root and US $1.50 per kg of the roots. Collectors charged the lowest price (US $0.06 and US $0.60 per piece and a kilogram of the roots respectively) though their profit margins remained the highest (50%). Several demand and supply opportunities exist for M. whytei roots and these included few sexual stimulant accepted alternatives to M. whytei roots in Kampala city; consumers' willingness to pay high prices when the roots are scarce, and a large number of M. whytei roots gatherers that could promote the cultivation of this plant for the market. Challenges, such as seasonal low supply of the roots, and unorganised market structure, hamper the trade in M. whytei roots. There is a need for experimental research on efficacies of the perceived uses of the roots reported in this study. The possibility of value addition to the roots sold should be investigated.

AB PROBLEM: Priority health-risk behaviors, which are behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults, often are established during childhood and adolescence, extend into adulthood, are interrelated, and are preventable.; REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: January--December 2007.; DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults, including behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 39 state surveys, and 22 local surveys conducted among students in grades 9--12 during 2007.; RESULTS: In the United States, 72% of all deaths among persons aged 10--24 years result from four causes: motor-vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 2007 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicated that many high school students engaged in behaviors that increased their likelihood of death from these four causes. Among high school students nationwide during 2007, 11.1% had never or rarely worn a seat belt when riding in a car driven by someone else. During the 30 days before the survey, 29.1% of high school students had ridden in a car or other vehicle driven by someone who had been drinking alcohol, 18.0% had carried a weapon, and 5.5% had not gone to school because they felt they would be unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. During the 12 months before the survey, 6.9% of high school students had attempted suicide. In addition, 75.0% of high school students had ever drunk alcohol, and 4.4% had ever used methamphetamines. Substantial morbidity and social problems among youth also result from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. Results from the 2007 survey indicated that 47.8% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 35.0% of high school students were currently sexually active, and 38.5% of currently sexually active high school students had not used a condom during last sexual intercourse. Among U.S. adults aged >or=25 years, 59% of all deaths result from two causes: cardiovascular disease and cancer. Results from the 2007 national YRBS indicated that risk behaviors associated with these two causes of death were present during adolescence. Among high school students nationwide during 2007, 20.0% had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days before the survey, 35.4% had watched television 3 or more hours per day on an average school day, and 13.0% were obese. During the 7 days before the survey, 78.6% of high school students had not eaten fruits and vegetables five or more times per day, 33.8% had drunk soda or pop at least one time per day, and 65.3% had not met recommended levels of physical activity.; INTERPRETATION: Since 1991, the prevalence of many health-risk behaviors among high school students nationwide has decreased. However, many high school students continue to engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. The prevalence of most risk behaviors does not vary substantially among cities and states.; PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: YRBS data are used to measure progress toward achieving 15 national health objectives for Healthy People 2010 and three of the 10 leading health indicators, to assess trends in priority health-risk behaviors among high school students, and to evaluate the impact of broad school and community interventions at the national, state, and local levels. More effective school health programs and other policy and programmatic interventions are needed to reduce risk and improve health outcomes among youth.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine possible associations between active commuting (walking or cycling) to school, parameters of adiposity and lifestyle factors in 14-year-old adolescents of the Kiel Obesity Prevention Study.; SUBJECTS: A total of 626 14-year-old adolescents.; METHODS: Measured body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), distance to school as well as self-reported modes and duration of commuting to school, time spent in structured and unstructured physical activities (PAs), media use, nutrition, alcohol consumption and smoking.; RESULTS: Parameters of adiposity did not differ between different commuting modes after stratifying by gender. Active commuters reported higher overall PA, which was caused by commuting activity and time spent in unstructured PA in girls and just by commuting activity in boys. In active commuters, 28.4% of overall PA was explained by commuting activity. Additionally, TV viewing was lower in active commuters. Compared to their inactively commuting counterparts, actively commuting boys were less likely to smoke. After controlling for potential confounders the interaction term 'active commuting by distance to school' and 'time spent in structured PA' were independent predictors of FM, whereas active commuting by itself showed no effect.; CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that active commuting to school per se does not affect FM or BMI until considering distance to school. Increasing walking or cycling distance results in decreasing FM. However, the everyday need to get to and from school may enhance adolescents' overall PA.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to explore whether parents of overweight adolescents who recognize that their children are overweight engage in behaviors that are likely to help their adolescents with long-term weight management.; METHODS: The study population included overweight adolescents (BMI >/= 85th percentile) who participated in Project EAT (Eating Among Teens) I (1999) and II (2004) and their parents who were interviewed by telephone in Project EAT I. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted with 314 adolescent-parent dyads, and longitudinal analyses were completed with 170 dyads.; RESULTS: Parents who correctly classified their children as overweight were no more likely than parents who did not correctly classify their children as overweight to engage in the following potentially helpful behaviors: having more fruits/vegetables and fewer soft drinks, salty snacks, candy, and fast food available at home; having more family meals; watching less television during dinner; and encouraging children to make healthful food choices and be more physically active. However, parents who recognized that their children were overweight were more likely to encourage them to diet. Parental encouragement to diet predicted poorer adolescent weight outcomes 5 years later, particularly for girls. Parental classification of their children's weight status did not predict child weight status 5 years later.; CONCLUSIONS: Accurate classification of child overweight status may not translate into helpful behaviors and may lead to unhealthy behaviors such as encouragement to diet. Instead of focusing on weight per se, it may be more helpful to direct efforts toward helping parents provide a home environment that supports healthful eating, physical activity, and well-being.

AB In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effect on tobacco use onset among middle school students of Family Communications (FC) activities designed to mobilize parental influences against tobacco use and Youth Anti-tobacco Activities (YAT) designed to market anti-tobacco norms to adolescents. We conducted a simple, two-condition experimental design in which 40 middle schools, with a prevalence of tobacco use at or above the Oregon median, received, by random assignment, either the intervention or no intervention. State, county, and local prevention coordinators around Oregon served as liaisons to schools. To generate interest, staff made presentations to these groups and distributed marketing packets at several conferences. Dependent variables were indices of smoking prevalence and use of smokeless tobacco (ST) in the prior month. Additionally, we created an intervention manual so that other communities could replicate this study. The findings suggest that efforts to influence parents to discourage their children's tobacco use and efforts to market an anti-tobacco perspective to teens are effective in preventing smoking. The impact of YAT is consistent with experimental and nonexperimental evaluations of media campaigns to influence young people not to smoke.

AB In 2006, approximately 70 million persons in the United States participated in recreational boating, and paddle sports vessels (i.e., canoes, kayaks, and inflatable rafts) made up the fastest-growing segment of the boating market. From 2005 to 2006, canoe sales in the United States increased by 23%, and kayak sales increased by 11%, while powerboat sales decreased by 5%. To analyze the trends and characteristics of deaths associated with paddle sports, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services examined data on fatalities that occurred during 2000-2007. The results of this analysis determined that paddle sports deaths were associated with inexperience, alcohol use, and not using a personal flotation device (PFD). To reduce the risk for paddle sports fatalities, boating organizations and water-sport enforcement agencies should encourage boater safety education, use of PFDs, and avoidance of alcohol before and during boating.

AB The objective of the study was to assess the relations of socioeconomic and behavioral factors to frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened soda among New York City (NYC) adults and the relation of frequent consumption to body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)). Data from the 2005 NYC Community Health Survey, a population-based telephone survey, were analyzed. Frequent consumption was defined as drinking one or more 12-oz servings of sugar-sweetened soda on an average day; 9,865 adults, aged 18 years and older, provided valid responses. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with frequent consumption, and linear regression models were used to assess the relation of frequent consumption to BMI. An estimated 27.5% of NYC adults are frequent sugar-sweetened soda consumers. Frequent consumption is independently associated with low household income (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.1 for <200% vs. > or =600% federal poverty level) and with ethnic group and nativity (e.g., OR = 3.1, 95% CI 2.6-3.7 for U.S.-born blacks vs. whites). Men report more consumption then women, but an association of less education with frequent consumption is stronger among women. Adjusting for demographics, frequent consumption is associated with more television viewing and with less physical activity. Adjusting for demographics and behaviors, frequent consumption was associated with higher BMI among women (0.7 BMI units, 95% CI 0.1-1.2) but not among men. Disparities in sugar-sweetened soda consumption mirror obesity disparities. Improved surveillance and interventions are needed to better quantify and reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, especially in groups most impacted by obesity.

AB Past research related to alcohol advertising examined whether underage adolescents were targets of the alcohol industry and what impact such advertising had on adolescent drinking. The purpose of this study was to longitudinally examine the impact of media resistance skills on subsequent drinking among adolescents residing in inner-city regions of New York City. The study also tested whether drug skill refusal techniques (knowing how to say no to alcohol and other drugs) mediated the relationship between media resistance skills and adolescent drinking. A panel sample of baseline, one-year and two-year follow-ups (N=1318) from the control group of a longitudinal drug abuse prevention trial participated. A series of structural equations models showed that media resistance skills directly negatively predicted alcohol use 2 years later and that drug skill refusal techniques mediated this effect. Baseline media resistance skills were associated with one-year drug skill refusal techniques, which in turn negatively predicted two-year alcohol use. These findings provided empirical support for including media resistance skills and drug skill refusal techniques in alcohol prevention programs.

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine social contexts and processes influencing transition to drug injection among street youth.; METHODS: 42 street youth participated in in-depth interviews. A typology of experiences was built founded on youth's street life and drug use trajectories. The transition to drug injection was examined through these experiences.; RESULTS: We identified five types of mutually exclusive experiences. The "downtowner's" experience is characterised by early street life and drug consumption trajectories, and a strong identification with the downtown milieu. These youth progress from one drug to another and, in a milieu where drug injection is omnipresent, this escalation culminates in transition to injection. The "tripper" street life and substance use trajectories begin later and are less intense. Most "tripper" youth are already chronic hallucinogens users when they arrive in downtown Montreal. Although they judge "junkies" severely, they show some ambivalence towards injection. The "on the go" experience is characterised by trajectories of drug use and street life that are intermingled, leading to a loss of control. These youth, who often have serious delinquent behaviours, come to downtown Montreal to party and consume drugs, mostly stimulants. Their drug use pattern and network make them at high risk of starting cocaine injection. The "hard-luck's" experience is characterised by a lack of identification with the downtown milieu. These youth who use drugs recreationally, end up in the streets accidentally, often because of unemployment. The "alcoholic' experience is related to alcohol misuse. These youth usually end up in the streets due to this dependence. Their street involvement is mostly an experience of solitude. The risk of transitioning to injection for both these types is low.; CONCLUSIONS: Some combinations of street life and drug use trajectories seem to contribute to injection among street youth. Some important factors interact and increase the risk of street youth transitioning to injection: poor personal assets; early rupture with primary social institutions; social integration into subcultures where both street life and "drug trips" are fashionable, drug preferences and the local drug market.

The regressions also account for readership demographics (adult reader age, income, gender, race), magazine characteristics (newsstand sales, number of annual issues), and type of beverage (beer, wine, spirits). Using count data models, the results indicate significant effects for price, audience size, and adult demographics, but fail to support claims that alcohol advertisers target adolescent readers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is a growing problem among adolescents, but little is known about self-management behaviors in this population. Our aim was to examine self-management behaviors and glycemic control among adolescents with type 2 diabetes.; METHODS: From 2003 to 2005, a telephone survey of adolescents with type 2 diabetes was performed. Chart review obtained most recent glycated hemoglobin and clinical characteristics. Analyses compared patient characteristics and self-management behaviors to recent glycated hemoglobin levels.; RESULTS: Of 139 patients contacted, 103 (74%) completed the study. The mean age was 15.4 years: 69% were girls, 47% were white, and 46% were black. Mean glycated hemoglobin was 7.7%, and the average duration of diabetes was 2.0 years. More than 80% of patients reported > or = 75% medication compliance, and 59% monitored blood glucose > 2 times daily. However, patients reported frequent episodes of overeating, drinking sugary drinks, and eating fast food. More than 70% of patients reported exercising > or = 2 times a week, but 68% reported watching > or = 2 hours of television daily. Nonwhite patients had higher glycated hemoglobin and hospitalizations per year compared with white patients. In multivariable analyses, nonwhite race remained significantly associated with higher glycated hemoglobin even after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, insurance status, and other factors. Nonwhite patients were more likely to watch > or = 2 hours of television per day (78% vs 56%), to report exercising < or = 1 time per week (35% vs 21%), and to drink > or = 1 sugary drink daily (27% vs 13%).; CONCLUSION: Although patients reported good medication and monitoring adherence, they also reported poor diet and exercise habits and multiple barriers. Nonwhite race was significantly associated with poorer glycemic control even after adjusting for covariates. This may, in part, be related to disparities in lifestyle behaviors. Additional studies are indicated to further assess self-management behaviors and potential racial disparities in adolescents with type 2 diabetes.

AB AIMS: To investigate alcohol drinking among urban Chinese and any changes between 2002 and 2005.; DESIGN: Two identical face-to-face interviews were carried out with two random samples with 2327 and 2613 respondents, respectively.; SETTING: Respondents were selected randomly from Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, between May and June 2002, and June and August 2005.; PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen to 65-year-old urban Chinese adults.; MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of drinking, frequency of drinking, typical occasion quantity, volume of annual consumption and heavier drinking were the main measures.; FINDINGS: Nearly three-quarters (90% for men and 55% for women) were current alcohol drinkers in 2005, and the prevalence of drinking alcohol had increased significantly since 2002 among both men and women; the largest increases occurred in the younger group (18-19 years) and among older women. There was no change in the frequency of drinking, the average quantities consumed by drinkers and the volume of absolute alcohol consumed by drinkers over this 3-year period. However, reflecting the increased prevalence of drinkers, the median volumes of absolute alcohol consumed in the sample as a whole had increased significantly. Older males were more likely to be categorized as larger-quantity drinkers: 30-65-year-old men accounted for 63%. There was also an increase over time in the proportion of larger-quantity drinkers: the proportion of male larger-quantity drinkers increased from 27% in 2002 to 35% in 2005.; CONCLUSIONS: In the urban setting of Wuhan, over the time-period 2002-05, there was an increase in prevalence of drinkers, particularly among younger people and older women. The average frequency and quantities consumed by drinkers did not change over this period; among drinking men the volumes of alcohol consumed were comparable to those in much more saturated commercial alcohol markets. The results did, however, show an increase over time in the proportion of older men who were engaged in heavier drinking and, in 2005, the proportion exceeded that in more saturated markets. These data suggest that, given the relatively high levels of consumption among established drinking groups, increases in the prevalence of drinkers over time may result in increases in harm if effective policies are not implemented.

AB AIMS: The growing consumption of alcopops (highly sweetened pre-mixed spirit-based drinks especially designed and marketed for adolescents and young adults) among adolescents below the minimum age has given rise to the suspicion that these designer drinks are conducive to encouraging young people to prematurely drink alcohol. Increasing concern with regard to the health of young people has prompted several countries to respond to the growing consumption of alcopops with the introduction of special taxes. The present review aims to analyse the relationship between alcopop consumption and expected negative consequences, in particular, with regard to the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumed, the number of negative alcohol-related consequences, the consumption of other drugs, and engagement in further risk behaviours.; METHODS: Systematic computer-assisted literature searches in Pub Med, PsycINFO, and Addiction Abstracts used the keywords 'alcopop', 'alcopops', 'designer drink', or 'designer drinks'. All publications relating to alcopops and their impact on adolescent drinking were included.; RESULTS: An analysis of existing studies shows that on the grounds of methodological limitations, such as not controlling for total alcohol consumption, evidence of an association between the consumption of alcopops and the effects mentioned above is scarce. Results rather indicate a clear relationship between the quantity of alcohol consumed and alcohol-related negative consequences.; CONCLUSIONS: In place of beverage-specific interventions, a successful alcohol policy should look to implement evidence-based measures for the reduction of total alcohol consumption.

AB Guarana (Paullinia cupana) extracts are most commonly used in Western markets as putatively psychoactive food and drink additives. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel groups study assessed the acute effects of either a vitamin/mineral/guarana supplement or placebo drink in 129 healthy young adults (18-24 years). Participants completed a 10min version of the Cognitive Demand Battery (comprising: Serial 3s and Serial 7s subtraction tasks, a Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) task, 'mental fatigue' scale). Thirty minutes following their drink participants made six consecutive completions of the battery (i.e. 60 min). The vitamin/mineral/guarana combination resulted in improved task performance, in comparison to placebo, in terms of both increased speed and accuracy of performing the RVIP task throughout the post-dose assessment. The increase in mental fatigue associated with extended task performance was also attenuated by the supplement. This research supports previous findings demonstrating guarana's cognition enhancing properties and provides evidence that its addition to a multi-vitamin-mineral supplement can improve cognitive performance and reduce the mental fatigue associated with sustained mental effort.

AB It is of no coincidence that a number of recent Harm Reduction Digests have addressed the issue of the reduction of alcohol-related harm. Despite the dominant focus on illicit drug use in the popular discourse, alcohol remains Australia's number one drug problem, as it is in many other developed countries. In this Digest Munro and de Wever use the 'four Ps' of marketing: product, price, place and promotion, to critique the two decades industry self-regulation of alcohol marketing. They conclude that if we are going to develop policies which effectively change Australian drinking culture to reduce alcohol-related harm, we need first to accept that the alcohol industry and the health field have separate and conflicting interests.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to quantify the material children and adolescents are exposed to while watching prime-time television so that school educators, health professionals, and parents can focus on issues of maximum exposure that must be addressed.; METHODS: Prime-time programming was recorded from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Hawaiian Standard Time daily for 2 weeks in July 2005. Recordings were then viewed to identify social behaviors of interest.; RESULTS: Each hour on average, sex was referenced 1.8 times, drugs 0.6 times, tobacco 0.3 times, alcohol 2.4 times, and violence/crime 6.0 times per network. Messages advocating exercise, anti-drug advocacy, and anti-smoking advocacy were each shown 0.2 times per hour; while anti-alcohol advocacy was shown 0.1 times per hour.; CONCLUSION: School educators, health professionals, and parents must recognize that prime-time television frequently exposes viewers to issues that are of critical importance to the health and social development of school-aged children and adolescents.

AB QUESTION: How does health misinformation become part of the American and Canadian vernacular?; DATA SOURCES AND SELECTION: Twenty-three databases were searched for articles discussing university freshmen weight gain. Research articles were examined for methodology, number and gender of the participants and weight gain. Popular press articles were reviewed for the types of information published: expert/anecdotal, weight gain, nutrition, exercise, health and alcohol. A timeline of article publication dates was generated.; RESULTS: Twenty peer-reviewed, 19 magazine, 146 newspaper, and 141 university newspaper articles were discovered. Appearance of media articles about the 'Freshman 15' mirrored the peer-reviewed articles, yet the information did not reliably depict the research. Research indicated a weight gain of less than five pounds (2.268 kg), while half of the popular press publications claimed a 15-pound (6.804 kg) weight gain. The misinformation was frequently accompanied by information about achieving weight control through diet, exercise, stress reduction and alcohol avoidance.; CONCLUSION: Understanding of how the concept of the 'Freshman 15' developed indicates that remediation efforts are needed. Collaborative efforts between health science and academic librarians, faculty and journalists to construct new paradigms for the translation of scientific evidence into information that individuals can use for decisions about health and well-being is suggested.

AB BACKGROUND: Binge drinking has been highlighted as a growing problem in the UK, particularly amongst females aged 18-25 years. University of Leeds is situated within a population that has one of the highest reported statistics of binge drinking in the UK. In September 2006, the 'Unit 1421' campaign was launched at University of Leeds with the aim to promoted sensible drinking amongst students. The aim of this study is to explore female perspectives on binge drinking and on 'Unit 1421' campaign in the University of Leeds.; METHODS: Using a purposive sample, two focus groups were conducted with 12 female students aged 18-23 years within university grounds. Participants were recruited via email and poster advertisements on campus.; RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the data: (i) lay perception of binge drinking; (ii) pressures of matching the drinking patterns of male peers; (iii) student rite of passage; (iv) evaluation of the 'Unit 1421' campaign.; CONCLUSION: The social context of student life impacts greatly upon students' choices to binge drink. The norms, beliefs and morals governing student culture and the use of alcohol to assert identity should be considered when tailoring health promotion efforts to this target audience. Larger qualitative and ultimately quantitative studies are warranted to extrapolate and test the social pressures on drinking in this age group.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to develop reliable procedures to monitor the content of alcohol advertisements broadcast on television and in other media, and to detect violations of the content guidelines of the alcohol industry's self-regulation codes.; METHOD: A set of rating-scale items was developed to measure the content guidelines of the 1997 version of the U.S. Beer Institute Code. Six focus groups were conducted with 60 college students to evaluate the face validity of the items and the feasibility of the procedure. A test-retest reliability study was then conducted with 74 participants, who rated five alcohol advertisements on two occasions separated by 1 week.; RESULTS: Average correlations across all advertisements using three reliability statistics (r, rho, and kappa) were almost all statistically significant and the kappas were good for most items, which indicated high test-retest agreement. We also found high interrater reliabilities (intraclass correlations) among raters for item-level and guideline-level violations, indicating that regardless of the specific item, raters were consistent in their general evaluations of the advertisements.; CONCLUSIONS: Naive (untrained) raters can provide consistent (reliable) ratings of the main content guidelines proposed in the U.S. Beer Institute Code. The rating procedure may have future applications for monitoring compliance with industry self-regulation codes and for conducting research on the ways in which alcohol advertisements are perceived by young adults and other vulnerable populations.

AB Human decision-making is remarkably susceptible to commercial advertising, yet the neurobiological basis of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored. With a series of Coke and Pepsi taste tests we show that patients with damage specifically involving ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), an area important for emotion, did not demonstrate the normal preference bias when exposed to brand information. Both comparison groups (neurologically normal adults and lesion patients with intact VMPC) preferred Pepsi in a blind taste test, but in subsequent taste tests that featured brand information ('semi-blind' taste tests), both comparison groups' preferences were skewed toward Coke, illustrating the so-called 'Pepsi paradox'. Like comparison groups, the VMPC patients preferred Pepsi in the blind taste test, but unlike comparison groups, the VMPC patients maintained their Pepsi preference in the semi-blind test. The result that VMPC damage abolishes the 'Pepsi paradox' suggests that the VMPC is an important part of the neural substrate for translating commercial images into brand preferences.

AB OBJECTIVE: Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15-to 20-year-olds. In 2004, nearly 8,000 15to 20-year-old drivers were killed in crashes. Epidemiologic studies repeatedly identify overrepresentation of young males in fatal crashes. Recent studies of young females and risk-taking behaviors (drug use, violent crime, risky sexual behavior) show unfavorable trends. The objective of this study is to study the extent of contribution of young female drivers to national fatal crashes over and to uncover unfavorable trends linked to risky driving behavior.; METHODS: Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS) on drivers in crashes with one or more fatalities during 1995-2004 were studied. Five age groups were used: 16, 17, 18, 19-20, and 21-24 years. Linear regression was used to measure trends over time. The regression results represent differences in proportions and changes in proportion of crashes that fell into specified categories. The FARS multiple imputation data sets was used to estimate the proportion of drivers with positive blood alcohol, and variance estimates were corrected for the imputation procedure.; RESULTS: In all, 139,000 fatal crashes involving the noted age groups occurred over 10 years. Safety restraint use: Females had more safety restraint use (by 17.8%) but a smaller increase in use over time. Driver's license validity: The percentage of valid licensure decreased over the study for young males and females both in the general population and among drivers in fatal crashes. Single-vehicle crashes: A lower proportion of female drivers (8.9% fewer) were involved in single-vehicle fatal crashes. This proportion changed little over the study period. Alcohol use: Females had a 16.7% lower proportion than males of alcohol involvement in fatal crashes. This lower proportion was seen throughout the age groups. When accounting for change over the study period, female drivers had a similar to male increase in alcohol-involved fatal crashes. Presence of peer passengers: Female drivers were less likely to have age peers as passengers.; CONCLUSIONS: While young male drivers surpass young females in number of fatal crashes, there are unfavorable trends linked to crash fatalities in young females. Our results suggest a smaller increase in safety restraint use, proportional decrease in license validity, and an increase in rate of alcohol-involved fatal crashes that approaches that seen in young males. These findings have considerable implications for future traffic safety social marketing campaigns, programs, and interventions.

AB The present study examined students' understanding and perceived effectiveness of a recent Australian alcohol campaign designed to increase students' awareness of excessive and harmful drinking. Six hundred and seventy one university students (51% females), who had seen the campaign posters, with the tagline "Is Getting Pissed Getting Pathetic? (Just Ask You Friends)", were asked to comment on the messages that the campaign was communicating and how informative, relevant, and effective they perceived the campaign. Many students were positive in their evaluations and described the messages as "truth and realistic", "clear and to the point", and that the campaign made them think about their own drinking. However, other views were more negative and indicative of psychological reactance. These included concerns that students "won't listen" or "don't care" about media campaigns, and that "they don't what to be told what to do". The findings highlight how media campaigns can help an audience contemplate behavioral change, however, they can also alienate students and promote counterproductive attitudes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To perform a comprehensive content analysis of substance use in contemporary popular music.; DESIGN: We analyzed the 279 most popular songs of 2005 according to Billboard magazine. Two coders working independently used a standardized data collection instrument to code portrayals of substance use.; OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence and explicit use of substances and motivations for, associations with, and consequences of substance use.; RESULTS: Of the 279 songs, 93 (33.3%) portrayed substance use, with an average of 35.2 substance references per song-hour. Portrayal of substance use varied significantly (P < .001) by genre, with 1 or more references in 3 of 35 pop songs (9%), 9 of 66 rock songs (14%), 11 of 55 R & B/hip-hop songs (20%), 22 of 61 country songs (36%), and 48 of 62 rap songs (77%). While only 2.9% of the 279 songs portrayed tobacco use, 23.7% depicted alcohol use, 13.6% depicted marijuana use, and 11.5% depicted other or unspecified substance use. In the 93 songs with substance use, it was most often motivated by peer/social pressure (45 [48%]) or sex (28 [30%]); use was commonly associated with partying (50 [54%]), sex (43 [46%]), violence (27 [29%]), and/or humor (22 [24%]). Only 4 songs (4%) contained explicit antiuse messages, and none portrayed substance refusal. Most songs with substance use (63 [68%]) portrayed more positive than negative consequences; these positive consequences were most commonly social, sexual, financial, or emotional.; CONCLUSIONS: The average adolescent is exposed to approximately 84 references to explicit substance use daily in popular songs, and this exposure varies widely by musical genre. The substance use depicted in popular music is frequently motivated by peer acceptance and sex, and it has highly positive associations and consequences.

AB BACKGROUND: This study examined the relationships between watching wrestling on television (TV) and engaging in health risk behaviors among an older multi-state sample of adolescents.; METHODS: In 2001, a random sample of 2,307 youth ages 16 to 20 years from 138 communities in 17 US states completed telephone surveys as part of the national evaluation of the Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws Program. The survey measured multiple health risk behaviors, including substance use, involvement in date fighting, other violent behaviors, and sexual risk behaviors. The frequency of watching wrestling on TV during the two week period before the survey was measured with a scale of 0 to 14 or more times. Multivariate analyses were conducted with logistic regression using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with an exchangeable correlation structure that controlled for within-group clustering. Data are presented as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals.; RESULTS: Males (22.4%) reported watching wrestling more than females (13.6%). After adjusting for ethnicity, sex, median family income, age, region of the country, other fighting behaviors, and family composition, the frequency of watching wrestling was associated with having tried to hurt someone with a weapon (OR = 1.67, CI = 1.05-2.66), engaging in sexual intercourse without using birth control (1.42, 1.01-1.98), being a current cigarette smoker (1.31, 1.02-1.69), and not drinking (0.64, 0.48-0.85). When the frequency of watching wrestling was treated as an independent variable, after adjusting for covariates, each additional time wrestling was watched on TV was associated with an increased risk of being in a date fight (1.16, 1.02-1.30), threatening to hurt someone with a weapon (1.14, 1.02-1.28), hurting someone with a weapon (1.19, 105-1.34), and engaging in sexual intercourse without using birth control (1.13, 1.03-1.23). For example, youth who had watched wrestling six times during the past two weeks were 144% more likely to have engaged in a date fight than adolescents who had not watched wrestling.; CONCLUSIONS: The more frequently these adolescents reported watching wrestling on TV, the more likely they were to engage in violent and other health risk behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Skeletal age deviation (SAD) is associated with bone mass and fracture risk in children, but factors determining this are unknown. The aim of this population-based cross-sectional study was to describe the factors associated with SAD.; METHODS: A convenience sample of 640 male and female children aged 7-17 yr was studied. All were assessed for body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), diet, strength, dexterity, habitual physical activity, sunlight exposure, smoking, and medication use. Skeletal age was assigned using the Tanner-Whitehouse-2 method.; RESULTS: Subjects with a SAD greater than the 75th percentile had significantly higher height, weight, and Tanner stage compared with all other subjects. Bone-free lean mass, fat mass, and grip strength were positively associated with SAD. In multivariate analysis, ever smoking and use of inhaled corticosteroids were negatively associated with SAD, whereas milk drinking was positively associated with SAD. There was no significant association between sunlight exposure, television watching, light, or strenuous exercise and SAD.; CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study should be regarded as hypothesis generating but are biologically plausible and suggest that body composition, strength, diet, ever smoking, and inhaled corticosteroid use may be determinants of bone maturity relative to age and thus affect fracture risk in children. However, more studies are necessary to explore other determinants of SAD such as genetic and perinatal factors and whether SAD influences peak bone mass.

Participants were 2194 adolescent boys and girls who completed a questionnaire on television viewing, risk perception and the intention to speed and drive after consuming alcohol. As hypothesized, more news viewing was associated with a higher perceived risk of drunk driving and speeding. More music video viewing, on the other hand, was negatively associated with the assessment of the dangers of speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. Girls regarded speeding and drunk driving as more dangerous than boys did. Contrary to our hypotheses, action movie viewing did not make a significant contribution to our models. Both news and music video viewing were indirectly, via risk perception, related to the intention to drive risky. The more dangerous a particular behavior was perceived to be, the less likely respondents intended to exhibit this behavior in the future.

Using advertisements and other recruitment strategies, 32 Spanish participants (16 treatment-seekers and 16 self-changers) were recruited, all of whom had had problems with alcohol consumption and had recovered 1 year or more previously. Participants were interviewed on a single occasion about their alcohol use history and recovery. Results showed that the two groups differed significantly in variables such as degree of dependence, type of recovery, and coping strategies used in the maintenance of recovery. As in previous research, pressure and support from the person's family and social circle played an important role in recovery and maintenance, especially for the treatment-seekers. These results are highly similar to those found in studies with English-speaking populations.

AB BACKGROUND: An ongoing debate exists about whether the US should adopt a universal health insurance programme. Much of the debate has focused on programme implementation and cost, with relatively little attention to benefits for social welfare.; OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect on US population health outcomes, measured by mortality, of extending private health insurance to the uninsured, and to obtain a rough estimate of the aggregate economic benefits of extending insurance coverage to the uninsured.; METHOD: We use state-level panel data for all 50 states for the period 1990-2000 to estimate a health insurance augmented, aggregate health production function for the US. An instrumental variables fixed-effects estimator is used to account for confounding variables and reverse causation from health status to insurance coverage. Several observed factors, such as income, education, unemployment, cigarette and alcohol consumption and population demographic characteristics are included to control for potential confounding variables that vary across both states and time.; RESULTS: The results indicate a negative relationship between private insurance and mortality, thus suggesting that extending insurance to the uninsured population would result in an improvement in population health outcomes. The estimate of the marginal effect of insurance coverage indicates that a 10% increase in the population-insured rate of a state reduces mortality by 1.69-1.92%. Using data for the year 2003, we calculate that extending private insurance coverage to the entire uninsured population in the US would save over 75 000 lives annually and may yield annual net benefits to the nation in excess of $US400 billion.; CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that extending health insurance coverage through the private market to the 46 million Americans without health insurance may well produce large social economic benefits for the nation as a whole.

AB Few studies on treatment or prevention of obesity have shown significant results. Theoretically, in children and adolescents as compared to adults, prevention of excessive weight gain should be easy due to the energy expended during growth, associated with more time spent in leisure-time activities. However, numerous factors that stimulate overeating and sedentary behaviors are difficult to overcome. Additionally, most intervention studies have focused on a minor portion of the many factors associated with obesity. Important aspects of the obesity epidemic such as the role of the food industry, fast food chains, advertising, and a lifestyle that limits children to sedentary activities and overeating cannot be explored by a traditional clinical trial design. At any rate, among the published interventions, those including the family in weight-reduction strategies have shown the best results, as compared to children-centered approaches. Meanwhile, studies on specific nutrient or dietary composition (such as calcium, protein, or glycemic index) related to prevention or treatment of obesity have failed to yield good results. Reducing the intake of high-sugar carbonated drinks and juices has shown promising but still inconclusive results.

Hierarchical regression analyses on fat, soft drink and fruit consumption, with demographic and psychosocial variables entered as the first and environmental factors as the second block were conducted in boys and girls.; RESULTS: Boys with more unhealthy products available at home consumed more fat (P< or =0.001, 95% CI: 8.2-29.4) and more soft drinks (P< or =0.01, 95% CI: 0.2-1.4). Boys who reported better television viewing habits ate more fruit (P< or =0.001, 95% CI: -1.7 to -0.5). Girls who reported better television viewing habits consumed less fat (P< or =0.01, 95% CI: 1.4-9.0) and more fruit (P< or =0.05, 95% CI: -1.0 to -0.1). Girls who reported higher availability of healthy products at home (P< or =0.05, 95% CI: 0.3-3.1) and more food rules (P< or =0.001, 95% CI: -1.8 to -0.5), consumed more fruit. Environmental factors were poor predictors of soft drink consumption among girls.; CONCLUSION: Availability of (un)healthy food products, family food rules and TV viewing habits were related to one or more eating behaviours in boys or girls. Although home environmental factors can play an important role in influencing adolescents' eating behaviours, these factors were generally less predictive than demographic and psychosocial variables.

AB Commonly suggested public health strategies to combat adolescent obesity are encouraging daily physical activity, limiting television viewing, replacing sweetened beverage consumption with water, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. This study examined the extent to which selected social cognitive theory constructs can predict these four behaviors among preadolescents in India. A 55-item valid and reliable scale was administered to 324 fifth graders. The significant predictor of physical activity was number of times taught at school (p < or = 0.008). None of the Social Cognitive theory variables were found to be significant predictors for numbers of hours of watching TV or drinking water instead of sweetened beverages. In the case of fruit and vegetable consumption, the significant predictor was self-efficacy to eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables (p < 0.0001). The study discusses ways Social Cognitive theory can be bolstered to influence adolescent obesity behaviors in India.

AB PROBLEM: Unsafe driving and passenger behaviors place teens at increased risk for fatal and nonfatal crashes. This study evaluated the short-and long-term efficacy of the You Hold the Key (YHTK) Teen Driving Countermeasure.; METHOD: A two-page survey was completed by high school students at pretest, posttest, and long-term (6-month) posttest.; RESULTS: YHTK was associated with significant immediate and long-term improvements in teen seatbelt use, safe driving, and perceived confidence in preventing drunk driving. Compared to pretests, students at immediate and long-term posttest more frequently wore seatbelts when driving or riding, required passengers to wear seatbelts, and limited the number of passengers to the number of seatbelts in the vehicle. Students were more likely at both posttests to avoid drinking and driving and to say no to riding with a friend who had been drinking.; SUMMARY: YHTK was associated with increases in safe teen driving and passenger behaviors.; IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Success of YHTK is most notably due to its comprehensive nature. Future programs should consider comprehensive strategies when attempting to modify teen behaviors.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess any clustering between obesity, number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT), television (TV) viewing, and lifestyle factors among pre-adolescents living in 2 countries with different developmental status and oral health care systems - Turkey and Finland.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of Finnish (n = 338) and Turkish (n = 611) preadolescents, 10-12 years old, was undertaken with preadolescent oral health data and health behavior questionnaires for pre-adolescents and their mothers. The parameters examined were DMFT, body mass index (BMI), leisure time activities (TV viewing), and lifestyle factors (family dinners and dietary habits) of pre-adolescents. Data analysis included factor analysis, Student's t-test, and Chi-square tests by cross tabulation.; RESULTS: Turkish pre-adolescents were more obese and had poorer dental health than their Finnish counterparts (p < 0.05). Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents drinking fizzy drinks more than 3 times a week were more likely to watch TV for >or= 2 h/school day (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-2.28) than those consuming them once a week or less (OR = 3.06, 95% CI 1.39-6.75; p < 0.05). Factor analysis revealed that DMFT and obesity shared the same cluster among Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents.; CONCLUSION: Both medical and dental examination of any pediatric patient should include BMI, leisure time activities, and dietary habits as well as socio-economic status.

AB BACKGROUND: Although many individual health behaviours (e.g. diet/activity) have been implicated in the current rise in obesity levels, their confounding or cumulative effects have yet to be established. This study psychometrically tested a previously piloted comprehensive measure of obesity risk factors, designed to assess their relative importance at individual and population levels.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: A user-friendly, self-report questionnaire, completed by 359 adult volunteers (71% female, age range 18-81 years), was subjected to exploratory factor analysis and related to body mass index (BMI) and age.; RESULTS: The final solution had 74 items and showed a clear factor structure, with 5 dietary and 5 activity factors, plus 8 unrelated factors covering dieting behaviour, alcohol consumption, sleep, and varied developmental influences. Younger respondents generally reported unhealthier behaviours. Once age was controlled for, less healthy eating, more emotional eating, higher amounts eaten, less physical activity, more use of mechanised transport, and more/less successful dieting behaviour were all strongly related to higher BMI, with lesser associations for more TV watching and less parental encouragement to be active.; CONCLUSION: This easy-touse self-report measure of multiple risk factors showed good psychometric properties and has merit in determining the contribution of varied factors in the tendency to overweight and obesity. The finding that younger adults generally reported less healthy dietary and activity behaviour indicates a pressing need for early intervention.

AB Liliana Escobar-Chaves and Craig Anderson investigate two important trends among American youth and examine the extent to which the two trends might be related. First, the authors note that U.S. youth are spending increasing amounts of time using electronic media, with the average American youngster now spending one-third of each day with some form of electronic media. Second, the authors demonstrate that American adolescents are engaging in a number of unhealthful behaviors that impose huge societal costs. Escobar-Chaves and Anderson detail the extent of five critical types of adolescent health risk behaviors identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-obesity, smoking, drinking, sexual risk taking, and violence. Obesity, the authors note, has become an epidemic among America's young people. Cigarette smoking among adolescents is one of the ten leading health indicators of greatest government concern. Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are widespread problems among the nation's youth and are the source of the three leading causes of death among youth. More than 20 percent of American high school students have sexual intercourse for the first time before they reach the age of fourteen. And twelve- to twenty-year-olds perpetrated 28 percent of the single-offender and 41 percent of multiple-offender violent crimes in the United States in 2005. Escobar-Chaves and Anderson present and evaluate research findings on the influence of electronic media on these five risk behaviors among adolescents. Researchers, they say, have found modest evidence that media consumption contributes to the problem of obesity, modest to strong evidence that it contributes to drinking and smoking, and strong evidence that it contributes to violence. Research has been insufficient to find links between heavy media exposure and early sexual initiation. The authors note the need for more large-scale longitudinal studies that specifically examine the cumulative effects of electronic media on risky health behavior.

AB PURPOSE: This longitudinal study examined the influence of alcohol advertising and promotions on the initiation of alcohol use. A measure of receptivity to alcohol marketing was developed from research about tobacco marketing. Recall and recognition of alcohol brand names were also examined.; METHODS: Data were obtained from in-class surveys of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Participants who were classified as never drinkers at baseline (n = 1,080) comprised the analysis sample. Logistic regression models examined the association of advertising receptivity at baseline with any alcohol use and current drinking at follow-up, adjusting for multiple risk factors, including peer alcohol use, school performance, risk taking, and demographics.; RESULTS: At baseline, 29% of never drinkers either owned or wanted to use an alcohol branded promotional item (high receptivity), 12% students named the brand of their favorite alcohol ad (moderate receptivity), and 59% were not receptive to alcohol marketing. Approximately 29% of adolescents reported any alcohol use at follow-up; 13% reported drinking at least 1 or 2 days in the past month. Never drinkers who reported high receptivity to alcohol marketing at baseline were 77% more likely to initiate drinking by follow-up than those were not receptive. Smaller increases in the odds of alcohol use at follow-up were associated with better recall and recognition of alcohol brand names at baseline.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol advertising and promotions are associated with the uptake of drinking. Prevention programs may reduce adolescents' receptivity to alcohol marketing by limiting their exposure to alcohol ads and promotions and by increasing their skepticism about the sponsors' marketing tactics.

AB In this cross-cultural study, the authors attempted to identify high-risk subgroups for alcohol consumption among college students. American and Greek students (N = 132) answered questions about alcohol consumption, religious beliefs, attitudes toward drinking, advertisement influences, parental monitoring, and drinking consequences. Heavy drinkers in the American group were younger and less religious than were infrequent drinkers. In the Greek group, heavy drinkers tended to deny the negative results of drinking alcohol and use a permissive attitude to justify it, whereas infrequent drinkers were more likely to be monitored by their parents. These results suggest that parental monitoring and an emphasis on informing students about the negative effects of alcohol on their health and social and academic lives may be effective methods of reducing alcohol consumption. Classification tree analysis revealed that student attitudes toward drinking were important in the classification of American and Greek drinkers, indicating that this is a powerful predictor of alcohol consumption regardless of ethnic background.

AB CONTEXT: Appalachia has high rates of tobacco use and related health problems, and despite significant impediments to alcohol use, alcohol abuse is common. Adolescents are exposed to sophisticated tobacco and alcohol advertising. Prevention messages, therefore, should reflect research concerning culturally influenced attitudes toward tobacco and alcohol use.; METHODS: With 4 grants from the National Institutes of Health, 34 focus groups occurred between 1999 and 2003 in 17 rural Appalachian jurisdictions in 7 states. These jurisdictions ranged between 4 and 8 on the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes of the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture. Of the focus groups, 25 sought the perspectives of women in Appalachia, and 9, opinions of adolescents.; FINDINGS: The family represented the key context where residents of Appalachia learn about tobacco and alcohol use. Experimentation with tobacco and alcohol frequently commenced by early adolescence and initially occurred in the context of the family home. Reasons to abstain from tobacco and alcohol included a variety of reasons related to family circumstances. Adults generally displayed a greater degree of tolerance for adolescent alcohol use than tobacco use. Tobacco growing represents an economic mainstay in many communities, a fact that contributes to the acceptance of its use, and many coal miners use smokeless tobacco since they cannot light up in the mines. The production and distribution of homemade alcohol was not a significant issue in alcohol use in the mountains even though it appeared not to have entirely disappeared.; CONCLUSIONS: Though cultural factors support tobacco and alcohol use in Appalachia, risk awareness is common. Messages tailored to cultural themes may decrease prevalence.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Different information exists about the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) in Germany, ranging from 35 to 40%. Several investigations have identified factors influencing the colonization of Hp in the stomach, but their significance is still being discussed. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of Hp in the metropolitan area of Hannover and defining the impact of education and lifestyle on Hp colonization.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Advertisements were placed in newspapers and on the radio. Of 829 who responded and were informed of the study 35 were excluded according to predefined criteria, the remainder sent questionnaires and containers for stool samples. 579 persons returned questionnaires and stool samples, but 16 were excluded because of borderline test results. The detection of Hp was done with a test for Hp-antigens in stool (Femto Lab H. pylori-Cnx-Test, R-Biopharm).; RESULTS: Among the final 563 tested persons (322 women, 241 men; mean age 46.6 12.2 years) 21% were Hp-positive and 79% negative. Participants with Hp were older than those without. Neither gender nor the consumption of caffeine, alcohol, nicotine and particular eating behaviour were related to Hp-status. However, persons who had incomplete or lower-level schooling were infected more often than those who had graduated from with high school.; CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Hp-prevalence among German adults may be lower than previously published. Known associations between Hp infection and age and education were confirmed.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate bullying behaviours and their associations with health and health risk behaviours. This study involved completion of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) and Youth Self Report (YSR) questionnaires by 3,519 students. Of the students, 59.4% (n=2,091) were neither bullies/nor victims, 22% (n=774) victims, 9.4% (n=331) bully/victims and 9.2% (n=323) bullies. Generally, students involved in bullying behaviours were more likely to have higher YSR scale scores than students who were not involved in bullying behaviours. Bully/victims had higher scores on the YSR subscales than others. Students involved in bullying behaviours were more likely not to use seat belts, to watch TV >or= 4 h/day, to be involved in a physical fight, to skip class and to spend time with friends than students who were not involved in bullying behaviours. Bully/victims and bullies were more likely to smoke cigarettes, to drink alcohol, to be drunk, to play computer games and to be sexually active than others. Bully/victims were more likely to have less educated mothers and to have difficulty in talking to both parents than others. Victims were more likely to have a lower socioeconomic status, to have difficulty in talking to opposite gender friends and to have difficulty in making new friends than others. Bullying behaviour is common and associated with other risk behaviours and psychological health problems in Istanbul high school students. Health professionals should be aware of the influence of bullying on health and particularly on bully/victims' health. There is a strong need for bullying prevention programmes in schools in Turkey.

AB AIMS: To study the prevalence of disordered eating attitudes and behaviours among adolescents in Hong Kong and to examine the socio-demographic and behavioural correlates.; METHODS: Three secondary schools with different academic performance were selected from the Eastern District of Hong Kong. A total of 2382 students enrolled in Forms 1-7 at the three schools completed a specially designed questionnaire. The questionnaire contained questions on socio-demographic information, body weight satisfaction, exposure to mass media, health behaviours as well as the Eating Attitudes Test - 26 (EAT-26). Data were analysed using Student's t-test, chi2 analysis and multivariate logistic regression models.; RESULTS: Disordered eating (EAT score > or =20) was present in 52 (3.9%) adolescent boys and 68 (6.5%) adolescent girls. The youngest case was only 11 years old. A high degree of body weight dissatisfaction was shared by our adolescents. Teenage girls, overweight youths and those with poor academic performance were at increased risk of having disordered eating. Strong associations were found between disordered eating and other health-compromising behaviours including smoking, alcohol and soft drug use, delinquent behaviours, suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviours. Exposure to entertainment, beauty and youth magazines was positively related to disordered eating.; CONCLUSIONS: Disordered eating is prevalent among adolescents in Hong Kong. It remains a significant public health challenge to our community. Prevention programmes targeting youths at the greatest risk should be considered.

AB Ready-to-drinks (RTDs) are composed of an alcoholic component and a soft-drink base and are primarily consumed by a youth market. The authors explored whether liking and experience with an RTD soft-drink base predicts liking for the RTD. Participants (N=350) from ages 12 to 30 years sampled 3 RTDs and their respective soft-drink and alcoholic components. For milk- and fruit-based RTDs, liking for and familiarity with their soft-drink base was the best predictor of liking for and familiarity with the RTD itself. For the Coke-based RTD, familiarity with and liking for bourbon best predicted familiarity with and liking for the RTD. All of these effects were consistent across blind and nonblind testing. The authors' results suggest that where there is perceptual similarity between the RTD and its soft-drink base, these beverages may provide an easy transition into alcohol consumption for novice drinkers.

AB BACKGROUND: Little is known about the labor market outcomes of people who have attempted suicide or thought about suicide.; METHODS: We used micro-level data from the first wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions 2001-2002 to examine the effects of suicidal behavior on income and employment. The data provide a representative sample of the U.S. population, with its primary purpose to provide information on alcohol use disorders for the civilian non-institutionalized population aged 18 and over. The data include employment, income, and other socioeconomic and demographic information on respondents. Since the survey included 43,093 people, the data include a large number of respondents who attempted suicide or thought about committing suicide. We estimated earnings regressions and logit and ordered logit employment regressions. We used methods of IV estimation as well as two stage linear probability models to address potential endogeneity of suicidal behavior while estimating regressions separately by sex, since there are significant differences in suicide rates, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation between men and women.; RESULTS: We find that suicide attempts and suicidal ideation are negatively related to personal income and the probability of employment. The effects differ by sex. Men and women who attempted suicide had mean earnings lower by 16 and 13 percent, respectively. This amount reflects the combined effect of suicidal behavior and mental illness. With instrumental variable regression, the magnitude of the effects becomes larger-for example, as much as 50 percent decrease in the income of males who attempted suicide. Thoughts of suicide negatively affect income but to a smaller extent. Logit and ordered logit regressions indicate that attempted suicide reduces the probability of fulltime employment by over 20 percentage points for men and approximately 17 percentage points for women.; IMPLICATIONS: People who engaged in suicidal behavior reported significantly lower employment and earnings. Although data were insufficient to directly address the issue, it appears the effect may persist over a long period of time. This is particularly troubling since health insurance is closely tied to employment and without health insurance, treatment options may be limited.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous research has indicated that children's behaviors have long-term effects on later life. Hence it is important to monitor the development of health risk behaviors in childhood. This study examined the changes in health risk behaviors in fourth- to sixth-grade students in northern Taiwan from 2001 to 2003.; METHODS: The Child and Adolescent Behaviors in Long-Term Evolution (CABLE) study collected data from 1,820 students from 2001 to 2003 (students were 9 or 10 years old in 2001). Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the aggregation of health risk behaviors. A linear growth curve model was used to determine whether health risk behaviors changed over time.; RESULTS: Of the 13 behaviors, staying up late and eating snacks late at night were the most prevalent (82.3% of subjects in 2001, 81.8% in 2002, 88.5% in 2003) and second most prevalent (68.7%, 67.4%, 71.6%) behaviors, respectively, from 2001 to 2003. The three least prevalent health risk behaviors were chewing betel nut (1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2%), smoking (1.4%, 1.0%, 0.8%), and drinking alcohol (8.5%, 6.0%, 5.2%). The frequencies of swearing and staying up late showed the greatest significant increases with time. On the other hand, suppressing urination and drinking alcohol decreased over time. Using exploratory factor analysis, we aggregated the health risk behaviors into three categories: unhealthy habits, aggressive behaviors, and substance use. Although students did not display high levels of aggressive behavior or experimentation with substances, the development of these behaviors in a small proportion of students should not be ignored. The results of the linear growth curve model indicated that unhealthy habits and aggressive behaviors increased over time. However, substance use slightly decreased over time.; CONCLUSION: We found that some health risk behaviors increased with time while others did not. Unhealthy habits and aggressive behaviors increased, whereas substance use slightly decreased during this period. Educational professionals should pay attention to the different patterns of change in these behaviors in elementary school students.

AB BACKGROUND: Concern has been expressed regarding the influence of the newer premixed alcohols, known as ready-to-drinks (RTDs), on adolescent alcohol use as a result of their sweet and milky flavours. Use of these flavours may reduce the natural barrier of the often strong and unpleasant flavour of alcohol to early experimentation and regular and heavy use.; AIM: To determine the acceptability and alcohol detectability of a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to young adolescents and young adults.; DESIGN: A convenience sample of 350 participants was recruited, 70 in each of five age groups. Participants were grouped according to age into 12-13 years, 14-15 years, 16-17 years, younger adults of 18-23 years and older adults of 24-30 years, with even gender distribution in an experimental design comparing blind and labelled acceptability testing of a range of RTDs and their alcohol and soft drink components, beer, wine and a novel beverage.; FINDINGS: The acceptability of alcohol increased with age; however, chocolate 'Mudshake', and to a lesser extent watermelon 'Breezer', had acceptability scores more like their soft drink base than their alcohol component. There were no significant differences in the ability to detect the presence of alcohol in the RTDs across age or beverage types.; CONCLUSION: Public policy makers and others concerned with preventing early initiation to alcohol use and binge drinking among adolescents should be aware that when using milk as a base for an RTD, particularly with an alcoholic base such as vodka, the drink may have high acceptance with young adolescents and equal palatability to milk, even though the presence of alcohol is not completely masked. Further research with a wider range of RTDs is required.

AB PURPOSE: To estimate medical and indirect costs to the Department of Defense (DoD) that are associated with tobacco use, being overweight or obese, and high alcohol consumption.; DESIGN: Retrospective, quantitative research.; SETTING: Healthcare provided in military treatment facilities and by providers participating in the military health system.; SUBJECTS: The 4.3 million beneficiaries under age 65 years who were enrolled in the military TRICARE Prime health plan option in 2006.; MEASURES: The findings come from a cost-of-disease model developed by combining information from DoD and civilian health surveys and studies; DoD healthcare encounter data for 4.1 million beneficiaries; and epidemiology literature on the increased risk of comorbidities from unhealthy behaviors.; RESULTS: DoD spends an estimated $2.1 billion per year for medical care associated with tobacco use ($564 million), excess weight and obesity ($1.1 billion), and high alcohol consumption ($425 million). DoD incurs nonmedical costs related to tobacco use, excess weight and obesity, and high alcohol consumption in excess of $965 million per year.; CONCLUSION: Unhealthy lifestyles are significant contributors to the cost of providing healthcare services to the nation's military personnel, military retirees, and their dependents. The continued rise in healthcare costs could impact other DoD programs and could potentially affect areas related to military capability and readiness. In 2006, DoD initiated Healthy Choices for Life initiatives to address the high cost of unhealthy lifestyles and behaviors, and the DoD continues to monitor lifestyle trends through the DoD Lifestyle Assessment Program.

AB CONTEXT: Obesity is a major public health problem in North America, particularly in Aboriginal people.; OBJECTIVE: To determine if a household-based lifestyle intervention is effective at reducing energy intake and increasing physical activity among Aboriginal families after 6 months.; DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION: Randomized, open trial of 57 Aboriginal households recruited between May 2004 and April 2005 from the Six Nations Reserve in Ohsweken, Canada. Aboriginal Health Counsellors made regular home visits to assist families in setting dietary and physical activity goals. Additional interventions included provision of filtered water, a physical activity program for children, and educational events about healthy lifestyles.; RESULTS: 57 households involving 174 individuals were randomized to intervention or usual care. Intervention households decreased consumption of fats, oils and sweets compared to usual care households (-4.9 servings per day vs. -3 servings/day, p=0.006), and this was associated with a reduction in trans fatty acids (-0.2 vs. +0.6 grams/day, p=0.02). Water consumption increased (+0.3 vs. -0.1 servings/day, p<0.04) and soda pop consumption decreased (-0.3 vs. -0.1 servings/day, p=0.02) in intervention households compared to usual care. A trend toward increased knowledge about healthy dietary practices in children, increased leisure-time activity and decreased sedentary behaviours was observed, although these differences were not statistically significant.; CONCLUSION: A household-based intervention is associated with some positive changes in dietary practices and activity patterns. A larger and longer-term intervention which addresses both individual change and structural barriers in the community is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine dietary supplementation practices and opinions, preferred means for dietary supplement (DS) education, and antidoping opinions among elite Canadian athletes varying in age and gender.; DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: Elite athlete training centers in Calgary, Canada and surrounding area.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 582 high-performance athletes (314 male, 268 female).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: High-performance athletes representing 27 sports with a mean age of 19.96+/-3.91 years completed a validated questionnaire assessing DS practices and opinions by recall. Sport categories included varsity, Canadian Sport Centre Calgary (CSCC), and National Sport School (NSS).; RESULTS: There was extensive DS use, with 88.4% of participants taking>or=1 DS (mean of 3.08+/-1.87 DS per user) during the previous 6 months. Overall, sport drinks (22.4%), sport bars (14.0%), multivitamins and minerals (13.5%), protein supplements (9.0%), and vitamin C (6.4%) were most frequently reported. Older athletes were significantly more likely to report greater DS usage; to be advised by teammates, health food store retailers, and magazines; to prefer supplementation education via individual interviews; to claim awareness of anti-doping rules; and to perceive anti-doping compliance. Relative to gender, significant differences were observed for the types of DS reported; supplementation advisors; justifications for DS use; and awareness of anti-doping regulations.; CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of this validated and reliable questionnaire has the potential for broad use and provides insight into the factors that influence DS use in elite athletes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern and prevalence of food and drink advertisements to children on commercial television in Sydney, Australia, and compare these with advertising regulations set out in the Children's Television Standards and results from a similar study in 2002.; DESIGN: Data were collected by recording television from 06.00 hours until 23.00 hours on all three commercial channels from Sunday 14 May 2006 to Saturday 20 May 2006 (357 h). The study analysed advertisements in two children's viewing periods, one as defined in the 2002 study and the other according to current standards. Food advertisements were coded using 18 food categories and were analysed by time period and popular children's programmes.; RESULTS: Food advertisements occurred in similar proportions during children's viewing hours and adult's viewing hours (25.5 vs. 26.9% of all advertisements, respectively), although there was a higher rate of high-fat/high-sugar food advertisements during children's viewing hours (49 vs. 39% of all food advertisements, P < 0.001). There were even more advertisements for high-fat/high-sugar foods during popular children's programmes, contributing to 65.9% of all food advertisements. Estimates of exposure indicate that children aged 5-12 years were exposed to 96 food advertisements, including 63 high-fat/high-sugar advertisements per week. Since 2002, there has been a reduction in overall food and high-fat/high-sugar food advertisements.; CONCLUSION: Despite reductions in overall levels of food advertising, children continue to experience high levels of exposure to food advertisements, which remain skewed towards unhealthy foods. Further food advertising regulation should be required to curtail the current levels of advertising of high-fat/high-sugar foods to children, to make them commensurate with recommended levels of consumption.

AB Because of the widespread use of drugs by adolescents, there is demand for scientific rigor in sampling and accuracy in methods for ascertaining drug use patterns. The present study: (1) characterized adolescents who responded to advertisements for marijuana users; (2) compared rates of drug use reported on the telephone versus an on-site interview; and (3) examined drug use patterns as a function of parental awareness of drug use. Adolescents, identifying themselves as marijuana users during telephone interviews, reported more use of other drugs than those denying marijuana use. There was a high degree of correspondence between telephone and on-site interviews for all drugs except alcohol, which was reported at a higher rate on-site. Of those reporting marijuana use in the past week, 69% tested positive for marijuana in their urine-drug screens. Finally, marijuana and alcohol use patterns were higher among adolescents whose parents were aware of drug use than those whose parents indicated that their adolescent did not use marijuana. These results indicate that adolescents are willing to self-identify as marijuana users and report drug and alcohol use during telephone interviews. Additionally, parents appear to become more aware of their adolescent's drug use with increased frequency of use.

AB BACKGROUND: Soft drinks have been widely available in the nation's schools for some years, but recently, in response to rising concern about the epidemic of obesity among youth, concerns have been raised as to whether they should be available, and if so, under what circumstances. This paper looks at how widespread soft drink availability is at present in schools, as well as the availability of other classes of beverages. Because overweight occurs disproportionately among minorities and those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), this paper also seeks to determine to what extent environmental conditions differ for these students. Differences between middle and high schools are also examined.; METHODS: Data for 2004 and 2005 were used from two ongoing United States national surveys: the Youth, Education, and Society (YES) study of school administrators (N=345), and the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study of secondary school students in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades surveyed in those same schools (N=37,543). Data were gathered in YES on the availability of various beverages in schools from vending machines and other venues, as well as about the presence and nature of pouring rights contracts with soft drink bottlers. Data were analyzed in 2006.; RESULTS: The vast majority of high school students today have soft drinks available to them in the school environment both through vending machines (88%) and in the cafeteria at lunch (59%), with middle schools providing somewhat less access. Diet soft drinks are less available, particularly at lunch. Most students (67% in middle and 83% in high school) are in schools that have a contract with a bottler. Revenues to schools generated by soft drink sales are quite modest. Hispanics are most likely to have soft drinks available throughout the school day. The SES of the students correlates negatively with whether the school allows advertising and promotion of soft drinks.; CONCLUSIONS: Current school practices regarding soft drink availability, advertising, and sales would seem likely to be contributing to the extent of overweight among American young people, and to some extent to the higher risk faced by Hispanic and lower SES youth.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify precursors of adolescent alcohol initiation and binge drinking.; DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.; SETTING: Self-report questionnaires.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5511 Growing Up Today Study participants aged 11 to 18 years in 1998. Main Exposures Individual, family, and social factors.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First whole drink of alcohol and binge drinking.; RESULTS: Between 1998 and 1999, 611 girls (19%) and 384 boys (17%) initiated alcohol use. Older age, later maturational stage, smoking, adults drinking in the home, underage sibling drinking, peer drinking, possession of or willingness to use alcohol promotional items, and positive attitudes toward alcohol were associated with an increased likelihood of alcohol initiation. Girls who ate family dinner at home every day were less likely to initiate alcohol use than girls who ate family dinner only on some days or never (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.87). Girls with higher social self-esteem and boys with higher athletic self-esteem were more likely to initiate alcohol use than those with lower self-esteem. Among teens who initiated alcohol use, 149 girls (24%) and 112 boys (29%) further engaged in binge drinking. Among girls, positive attitudes toward alcohol, underage sibling drinking, and possession of or willingness to use alcohol promotional items were associated with binge drinking; among boys, positive attitudes toward alcohol and older age were associated with binge drinking.; CONCLUSIONS: Eating family dinner at home every day may delay alcohol uptake among some adolescents. Alcohol promotional items appear to encourage underage alcohol initiation and binge drinking; this may warrant marketing restrictions on the alcohol industry.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether perceiving portrayals of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos was associated with adverse health outcomes among African American adolescent females.; METHODS: African American female adolescents (n = 522) were recruited from community venues. Adolescents completed a survey consisting of questions on sociodemographic characteristics, rap music video viewing habits, and a scale that assessed the primary predictor variable, portrayal of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos. Adolescents also completed an interview that assessed the health outcomes and provided urine for a marijuana screen.; RESULTS: In logistic regression analyses, adolescents who perceived more portrayals of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos were more likely to engage in binge drinking (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.32-11.04, p = 0.01), test positive for marijuana (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.19-9.85, p = 0.02), have multiple sexual partners (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.01-3.71, p = 0.04), and have a negative body image (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.02-2.26, p = 0.04). This is one of the first studies quantitatively examining the relationship between cultural images of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos and a spectrum of adverse health outcomes in African American female adolescents.; CONCLUSIONS: Greater attention to this social issue may improve the health of all adolescent females.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining the relationship between physical activity levels and broad-based measures of psychological wellbeing in adolescents have been limited by not controlling for potentially confounding variables. The present study examined the relationship between adolescents' self-reported physical activity level, sedentary behaviour and psychological wellbeing; while controlling for a broad range of sociodemographic, health and developmental factors.; METHODS: The study entailed a cross-sectional school-based survey in ten British towns. Two thousand six hundred and twenty three adolescents (aged 13-16 years) reported physical activity levels, patterns of sedentary behaviour (TV/computer/video usage) and completed the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ).; RESULTS: Lower levels of self-reported physical activity and higher levels of sedentary behaviour showed graded associations with higher SDQ total difficulties scores, both for boys (P < 0.001) and girls (P < 0.02) after adjustment for age and town. Additional adjustment for social class, number of parents, predicted school examination results, body mass index, ethnicity, alcohol intake and smoking status had little effect on these findings.; CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of self-reported physical activity are independently associated with diminished psychological wellbeing among adolescents. Longitudinal studies may provide further insights into the relationship between wellbeing and activity levels in this population. Ultimately, randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of increasing physical activity on psychological wellbeing among adolescents.

AB The rising prevalence of obesity among children and youth worldwide has been associated with marketing of unhealthy food products and drinks directed towards these age groups. Consumer organizations and several states want to regulate such marketing by law, but commercial actors prefer self-regulation. International human rights, including the rights to food and health, provide arguments for legal regulation of commercial conduct in matters where health and nutritional status may be affected negatively. There is an increasing awareness of the fact that human rights require states to take effective measures to counteract obesity and related diseases. This may give rise to a more systematic use of human rights for protection and promotion of public health in general.

AB BACKGROUND: A number of studies using cross-sectional data have demonstrated that the availability of alcohol, measured by the number and types of alcohol outlets, is directly related to numerous measures associated with drinking and driving. The current study contributes the first observation of relationships over time between alcohol outlet densities on one hand and both automobile crashes and related injuries on the other hand.; METHOD: The study examined longitudinal data from 581 consistently defined zip code areas represented in the California Index Locations Database, a geographic information system that coordinates population and ecological data with spatial attributes for areas across the state. Six years of data were collected on features of local populations (e.g., demographics, household size) and places (e.g., retail markets) thought to be related to two measures of automobile crashes (hospital discharges related to car crash injuries geocoded to the zip code of patient residence, and police reports associated with car crashes geocoded to the zip code of crash location). Both crash measures were positively associated with two outlet types: bars, and off-premise outlets. Additionally, restaurants appear to provide a protective effect relative to the residence-based measure. Crash rates were also related to changes in population and place characteristics using random effects models with controls for spatial autocorrelation (nxt=3486 observations). Changes in population and place characteristics of adjacent (spatially lagged) areas were also considered.; RESULTS: Over time, both local and lagged population and place characteristics were related to automobile crash-related measures.; CONCLUSION: Controlling for cross-sectional differences between zip code areas, changes in numbers of licensed alcohol retail establishments, especially bars and off-premise outlets, affect rates of car crashes and related injuries.

AB BACKGROUND: Although binge drinking (drinking five or more drinks on an occasion) is an important public health problem, little is known about which beverage types are consumed by binge drinkers. This knowledge could guide prevention efforts because beer, wine, and liquor are taxed, marketed, and distributed differently.; METHODS: Data from 14,150 adult binge drinkers who responded to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System binge-drinking module in 2003 and 2004 were analyzed. Information pertained to the amount of alcohol consumed during a binge drinker's most recent binge episode, including beverage-specific consumption.; RESULTS: Overall, 74.4% of binge drinkers consumed beer exclusively or predominantly, and those who consumed at least some beer accounted for 80.5% of all binge alcohol consumption. By beverage type, beer accounted for 67.1%, liquor for 21.9%, and wine accounted for 10.9% of binge drinks consumed. Beer also accounted for most of the alcohol consumed by those at highest risk of causing or incurring alcohol-related harm, including people aged 18-20 years (67.0% of drinks were beer); those with three or more binge episodes per month (70.7%); those drinking eight or more drinks per binge episode (69.9%); those binging in public places (64.4%); and those who drove during or within 2 hours of binge drinking (67.1%).; CONCLUSIONS: Beer accounted for two thirds of all alcohol consumed by binge drinkers and accounted for most alcohol consumed by those at greatest risk of causing or incurring alcohol-related harm. Lower excise taxes and relatively permissive sales and marketing practices for beer as compared with other beverage types may account for some of these findings. These findings suggest that equalizing alcohol control policies at more stringent levels would be an effective way to prevent excessive drinking.

AB Relatively little is known about how youth obtain marijuana and other drugs. The Drugs, Alcohol and Violence International (DAVI) study explored youthful drug markets among samples of school students, detained youth, and school dropouts (ages 14-17 years) in the greater metropolitan areas of Philadelphia, Toronto, Montreal, and Amsterdam. Students frequently reported sharing drugs, either getting them from others or giving them to others for free. Sharing was less common among the more drug-involved detainees and dropouts. Marijuana was typically obtained either outdoors or in a house or apartment. Few youth reported getting marijuana at school. In Amsterdam, where marijuana can be purchased in small quantities in coffeeshops, this was the most common place to get marijuana, even though 18 is the legal age for purchase. Alcohol was also most likely to be obtained in stores or restaurants across all the sites, even though none were of legal age except those in Amsterdam age 16 or older. Youth most often reported purchasing marijuana in nickel, dime or other small bags, which are not standardized units. The exception again was Amsterdam, where youth most often reported quantities in grams or joints, which is how it is sold in coffeeshops. The lack of standardization of units makes economic cost estimates suspect. Even standardized units such as alcohol present problems since youth report a wide range of 'typical purchases.' Survey data can, however, more aptly describe drug market characteristics such as general location of purchase, and relationship with the seller.

AB The aim of this study was to provide a current assessment of Australian secondary students' self-reported dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. This study also examined the relationship between television viewing and students' dietary behaviour. Data are from a cross-sectional survey of 18 486 secondary students in 2005 from all Australian states except Western Australia. Participants reported their usual daily consumption (number of serves) of vegetables and fruit; their weekly consumption of unhealthy/non-core foods including fast food meals, snack foods and high-energy drinks; their engagement in moderate-vigorous physical activity over the previous week; and hours spent using electronic media for entertainment and doing homework on school days. The study found that 20% of students were meeting the daily requirement of four serves of vegetables, whereas 39% were eating the recommended three daily serves of fruit. Consumption of unhealthy/non-core foods was high, with 46% of students having fast food meals at least twice a week, 51% eating snack foods four or more times per week and 44% having high-energy drinks four or more times per week. Fourteen per cent of students engaged in recommended levels of physical activity and 29% engaged in recommended levels of sedentary behaviour. Age and gender differences occurred for most measures, and there were some socio-economic status differences. Heavier television use was associated with lower consumption of fruit and higher consumption of unhealthy/non-core foods. On the basis of the results of this study, it appears that a significant proportion of Australian secondary students fall short of current, national dietary and physical activity recommendations for teenagers. Continual monitoring of these behaviours is essential to help inform research and policy and identify where future efforts should be directed.

AB OBJECTIVE: Given the inconsistent findings in the literature, the authors' purpose in this study was to examine the associations between physical activity and behavioral and perceptional correlates, such as binge drinking, cigarette smoking, fruit or vegetable consumption, and weight perceptions, among midwestern college students.; PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The authors invited a convenience sample of 1,200 undergraduate college students enrolled in the 2004-2005 academic year in 4 different midwestern universities to participate in a survey. Of the 1,163 students who participated in the survey, a total of 1,134 usable surveys were received (response rate of 94.5%).; RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that smoking, perceived weight, and consumption of fruit were independent predictors of physical activity when controlling for other variables.; CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity promotion requires tailored approaches that are dependent on the target segment of the college student populations.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between watching television during family meals and dietary intake among adolescents.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using survey data from a diverse sample of adolescents.; SETTING: Data were collected from a school-based survey during the 1998-1999 school year.; PARTICIPANTS: Middle and high school students (N = 4746) from 31 public schools in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Response rate was 81.5%.; VARIABLES MEASURED: Intake of fruits, total vegetables, dark green/yellow vegetables, calcium-rich food, grains, soft drinks, fried food, snack food, calories, family meal frequency, and watching television during meals.; ANALYSIS: General linear modeling comparing dietary intake across 3 groups.; RESULTS: 33.5% of boys and 30.9% of girls reported watching television during family meals. Adolescents watching television were found to have lower intakes of vegetables, dark green/yellow vegetables, calcium-rich food, and grains and higher intakes of soft drinks compared to adolescents not watching television during meals. However, watching television during family meals was associated with a more healthful diet than not eating regular family meals.; CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Watching television during family meals was associated with poorer dietary quality among adolescents. Health care providers should work with families and adolescents to promote family meals, emphasizing turning the TV off at meals.

AB BACKGROUND: The Pacific OPIC Project (Obesity Prevention In Communities) includes whole-of-community intervention programs in four countries (Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand, Australia) aimed at reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in youth.; DEVELOPMENT OF ACTION PLANS: At each intervention site, preliminary interviews were conducted with youth to identify the potential socio-cultural barriers and facilitators to healthy eating and regular physical activity in order to attain and sustain a healthy body size. This and other information was presented at a 2-day workshop with community stakeholders, including youth. The participants then prioritised the components for a draft action plan which was later consolidated through further community consultation.; ACTION PLAN OBJECTIVES: Each action plan had two overall aims: to build community capacity and to promote healthy weight. The first three objectives in each action plan were on capacity building, social marketing messages, and evaluation. Next were a set of four to five behavioural objectives with associated strategies involving programs, events, social marketing and environmental change. Lastly, each site had one or two innovative or developmental objectives.; PROGRESS: Interventions began in all sites from 2005, with the action plans guiding implementation priorities. The initial behavioural objective for targeting in Fiji was eating regular breakfast and meals throughout the day, for Tonga it was physical activity, and for Australia and New Zealand it was increasing water consumption and decreasing consumption of sweet drinks.; CONCLUSIONS: The action plans have provided the basis for community engagement in the project, the guide to the implementation of activities and the template for the evaluation plan.

AB OBJECTIVE: In light of the high rates of child and adolescent obesity, we examined the nutritional content of food advertising seen by American children and adolescents.; METHODS: We drew samples of top-rated television shows by using ratings data to examine the nutritional content for fat, saturated fat, sugar, sodium, and fiber of food-product advertisements seen on television by both children and adolescents. Food products were examined in aggregate and by 5 separate categories that included cereal, sweets, snacks, drinks, and other food products. For 2- to 11-year-olds and 12- to 17-year-olds, respectively, a sample of 50,351 and 47,955 30-second-equivalent food-product advertisements and their related nutritional content were weighted by television ratings data to provide actual exposure measures of the nutritional content of food advertising seen by children and adolescents.; RESULTS: Study results showed that 97.8% and 89.4% of food-product advertisements viewed by children 2 to 11 years old and adolescents 12 to 17 years old, respectively, were high in fat, sugar, or sodium. On average, 46.1% and 49.1% of total calories among the products advertised came from sugar in the advertisements seen by these respective age groups. A total of 97.6% of cereal advertisements seen by children 2 to 11 years old were for high-sugar cereals. No substantial differences were found in the nutritional content of advertisements seen by black and white children 2 to 11 years old. However, a slightly higher proportion of food advertisements in general and across all food-product categories seen by black versus white adolescents were for high-sugar products.; CONCLUSION: The overwhelming majority of food-product advertisements seen on television by American children and adolescents are of poor nutritional content.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess overweight and related risk factors among urban low socio-economic status (SES) African-American adolescents in an attempt to study the underlying causes of ethnicity and gender disparities in overweight.; METHODS: Cross-sectional data collected on anthropometric measures, diet, physical activity and family characteristics from 498 students in grades 5-7 in four Chicago public schools were analysed to study the risk factors for overweight using stepwise regression analysis.; RESULTS: Only 37.2% of the students lived with two parents. Nearly 90% had a television (TV) in their bedroom, and had cable TV and a video game system at home. Overall. 21.8% (17.7% boys versus 25.1% girls) were overweight (body mass index (BMI) >/= 95th percentile); and 39.8% had a BMI >/= 85th percentile. Compared with national recommendations, they had inadequate physical activity and less than desirable eating patterns. Only 66.1% reported having at least 20 min vigorous exercise or 30 min of light exercise in >/= 5 days over the past 7 days; 62.1% spent >3 h days- 1 watching TV/playing video games/computer, while 33.1% spent >/= 5 h days- 1. Their vegetable and fruit consumption was low, and they consumed too many fried foods and soft drinks: 55.1% consumed fried food twice or more daily and 19.5% four times or more daily; 70.3% consumed soft drinks twice or more daily and 22.0% four times or more daily on average. Gender, physical activity and pocket money were significant predictors of overweight (P < 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS: Several factors in the students' behaviours, school and family environments may increase overweight risk among this population. There is a great need for health promotion programmes with a focus on healthy weight and lifestyle, and targeting urban low-SES minority communities.

AB BACKGROUND: The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was used by a city school district (approximately 11,000 students) in the upper Midwest to monitor trends for nutrition and physical activity (PA) behaviors both within and between years and to compare with national 2003 data.; METHODS: Independent random samples were obtained in 1999 (387 middle school [MS] and 931 high school [HS]), in 2001 (322 MS and 367 HS), and in 2003 (658 MS and 1026 HS). A two-sample test of proportions was used.; RESULTS: Within each survey year, a higher proportion of MS compared to HS reported positive behaviors with some exceptions: (1) an increased proportion of HS having daily physical education (PE) and (2) a reduced proportion of HS reporting media time. Within 2003, a lower proportion of district females compared to males (MS and HS) reported participation in many measured behaviors. District trends overtime indicated a reduced proportion: (1) drinking milk (MS and HS), (2) eating breakfast (HS), and (3) watching television (MS). Trends overtime indicated an increased proportion: (1) using computers for fun (MS and HS), (2) participating in moderate PA (MS), and (3) daily PE (HS). District HS compared to national (2003) indicated a higher proportion: (1) drinking milk, (2) getting moderate PA, and (3) taking daily PE. District HS compared to national indicated a lower proportion: (1) at risk of overweight, (2) overweight, and (3) watching television.; CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of district YRBS trends provides both a database for informed decisions by the school district and an assessment model for other districts.

AB Alcohol consumption among persons aged 12-20 years contributes to the three leading causes of death (unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide) in this age group in the United States and is associated with other health-risk behaviors, including high-risk sexual activity, smoking, and physical fighting. Recent studies have documented the contribution of alcohol marketing to underage drinking. In 2000, the trade association for the wine industry changed its voluntary marketing code to stop advertising in magazines in which youths aged 12-20 years were >30% of the audience. In 2003, this threshold was adopted by the trade associations for beer and liquor producers. To determine the proportion of alcohol advertisements placed in magazines with disproportionately large youth readerships (i.e., >15% of readers aged 12-20 years) and to assess the proportion of youths exposed to these advertisements, the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth (Health Policy Institute, Georgetown University, District of Columbia) evaluated the placement of alcohol advertisements in 143 national magazines for which readership composition data were available for 2001-2005; these 143 publications accounted for approximately 90% of expenditures for all alcohol advertising in national print magazines. This report summarizes the results of that study, which indicated that alcohol advertising remained common in magazines with >15% youth readership but decreased substantially in magazines with >30% youth readership. These results suggest that although voluntary industry standards have reduced youth exposure to alcohol advertising in magazines, strengthening these standards by establishing a >15% youth readership threshold would further reduce exposure. In addition, independent monitoring of youth exposure to alcohol advertising should continue, as recommended by the U.S. Congress and Surgeon General.

AB The need has never been greater to support healthy eating and physical activity in children and youth; the numbers of overweight and obese children have doubled and tripled, respectively, over the past 3 decades. Poor eating habits, including inadequate intake of vegetables, fruit, and milk, and eating too many high-calorie snacks, play a role in childhood obesity. Grain products provide the highest percentage (31%) of daily calories, followed by "other foods," which have limited nutritional value (22% of daily calories). Snacks account for 27% of total daily calories, which is more than the calories consumed at breakfast (18%) and lunch (24%), but not dinner (31%). For Canadians older than 4 years of age, more than 41% of daily snack calories come from other foods, such as chips, chocolate bars, soft drinks, fruit drinks, sugars, syrup, preserves, fats, and oils. Habits that protect against childhood obesity include eating more vegetables and fruit, eating meals with family, and being physically active. Children's food habits and choices are influenced by family, caregivers, friends, schools, marketing, and the media. Successful interventions for preventing childhood obesity combine family- and school-based programs, nutrition education, dietary change, physical activity, family participation, and counseling.

AB OBJECTIVE: The promotion of alcohol by retailers and media can contribute to a culture of excessive alcohol consumption, but the effect of non-advertising alcohol promotions has largely been neglected. This study sought to gather initial data on this important area.; METHOD: An observational study of alcohol point-of-sale promotions in the Wollongong CBD area, conducted in July-August 2005.; RESULTS: We identified 17 different promotions in three categories: gift with purchase; competitions; and buy some, get some free.; CONCLUSION: Given previous research demonstrating the relationship between increased alcohol consumption and both ownership of alcohol-related merchandise and reduced per unit price, it appears that point-of-sale promotions may have the potential to further increase alcohol consumption among young people.; IMPLICATIONS: Only when the extent and impact of such promotions is demonstrated will we be in a position to effectively advocate for appropriate regulations to ensure young people are not exposed to marketing strategies that further increase their exposure to alcohol-related harms.

AB Obesity is a major pediatric public health problem. Adolescents are a priority population for intervention strategies. School nurses are in key positions to design intervention strategies to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent adolescent obesity in the students they serve. To design effective programs, school nurses need to know what components their students perceive as important. This study involved the development and administration of a questionnaire to middle school students to determine their attitudes about overweight/obesity and what they felt would work for them. Adolescents are willing to exercise more, to change eating habits to include more fruits and vegetables, drink more water, and eat less junk food. They are not willing to give up soda, video/computer games, and watching television to improve their health. School nurses can use this questionnaire to collect data that will assist in the development of effective programs for their students.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) document and describe all outdoor alcohol advertisements surrounding schools and (2) examine the association between exposure to alcohol advertising in sixth grade and youth alcohol use, intentions, norms, and attitudes in eighth grade.; METHOD: All outdoor alcohol advertisements within 1,500 feet of 63 Chicago school sites were documented and coded for content and theme. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression analysis was used to determine the association between number of alcohol advertisements around a school in sixth grade and student alcohol behaviors, intentions, norms, and attitudes at the end of eighth grade, 2 years later. Participants included 2,586 sixth-grade students in the 2002-2003 school year. The sample was 37% black, 33% Hispanic, and 15% white. Gender was evenly distributed, and the average age was 12.2 at the end of sixth grade.; RESULTS: A total of 931 alcohol advertisements were found within 1,500 feet of the 63 school sites. Exposure to alcohol advertising around schools at the end of sixth grade was found to predict alcohol intentions at the end of eighth grade. This finding held true even for those students who were nonusers of alcohol in sixth grade.; CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to outdoor alcohol advertising around schools is associated with subsequent youth intentions to use alcohol. The association between exposure to alcohol advertising and youth alcohol-use intentions was found even among sixth-grade nonusers of alcohol, suggesting that even those who have not used alcohol are still influenced by alcohol advertising. These findings suggest that restrictions in alcohol advertising near schools may be warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the food habits and physical (in)activity patterns and to investigate the relationship with sociodemographic factors among Palestinian adolescents.; DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The Palestinian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) is a cross-sectional survey of grades 6, 8, 10 and 12. Students completed a modified version of the international HBSC questionnaire. A total of 8885 students were included in this analysis; 53% were from the West Bank and 47% from the Gaza Strip.; RESULTS: Adolescents in the West Bank consume more fruit, meat, chicken, sweets and soft drinks, but less vegetables than adolescents in Gaza (P<0.01). Girls reported more daily consumption of fruit, vegetables and sweets than boys (P<0.001), and less consumption of soft drinks, milk, meat and chicken (P<0.01). Boys were physically more active than girls (P<0.01), whereas girls reported doing more homework (P<0.001). Both boys and girls reported less physical activity with increasing age (P<0.001). Consumption of fruit and milk was positively associated with both parents' education, while consumption of meat, chicken and soft drinks was positively associated with mother's education only. Having breakfast on schooldays was positively associated with the father's education. Physical activity and television viewing were associated with the mother's education (P<0.01). The parents' level of education had no effect on vegetable consumption and dieting status.; CONCLUSION: This study indicated that there are problems with Palestinian adolescents' eating, dieting and physical activity. Regional, gender and parental socio-economic status differences should be taken into account in developing interventions. More detailed studies are needed with more elaborate instruments about food habits and physical activity of adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Voltarol for injection (a diclofenac sodium formulation employing polyethylene glycol and benzyl alcohol [PG-BA] as excipients) is marketed in Europe but not in North America. A suspension, PG-BA diclofenac sodium, requires preparation for each patient and slow IV infusion to minimize venous irritation. Dyloject, a novel diclofenac formulation, employs hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) to solubilize diclofenac in a small volume. We compared the efficacy and safety of an IV HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium bolus, a 30-minute PG-BA diclofenac sodium infusion, and placebo in post-molar extraction pain.; METHODS: A total of 155 adult patients were randomized to receive HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium 75 mg, PG-BA diclofenac sodium 75 mg, or placebo. Primary endpoints were superiority of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium to placebo and noninferiority of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium to PG-BA diclofenac sodium with respect to total pain relief over 4 hours (TOTPAR4) on a 0 to 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints included categorical TOTPAR4, VAS and categorical TOTPAR up to 8 hours, other measures of pain intensity and relief, patient global evaluation, and time to rescue medication.; RESULTS: HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium had efficacy superior to both placebo and PG-BA diclofenac sodium. At 15 minutes, more patients given HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium than PG-BA diclofenac sodium reported 30% reduction in pain intensity (52% vs. 21%, P = .0022). Both diclofenac products had a 6-hour duration of effect and were well tolerated. Patient global evaluations of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium were high, superior to placebo, and similar to PG-BA diclofenac sodium. The adverse event (AE) incidence was similar for HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium and PG-BA diclofenac sodium, except that in the current trial and in integrated safety results from the present and prior studies, phlebitis was more common with PG-BA diclofenac sodium. No cardiac or renal AEs or gastrointestinal bleeding were reported or observed.; CONCLUSIONS: IV bolus HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium produced analgesia more quickly than, and with equal duration as, the 30-minute PG-BA diclofenac sodium infusion. Pooled data on thrombophlebitis from the present investigation and our prior studies of the novel formulation indicate this adverse effect is less frequent and less severe with HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium than with PG-BA diclofenac sodium.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate whether adolescent readers attend to responsibility or moderation messages (e.g., "drink responsibly") included in magazine advertisements for alcoholic beverages and to assess the association between attention and the ability to accurately recall the content of these messages.; METHODS: An integrated head-eye tracking system (ASL Eye-TRAC 6000) was used to measure the eye movements, including fixations and fixation duration, of a group of 63 adolescents (ages 12-14 years) as they viewed six print advertisements for alcoholic beverages. Immediately after the eye-tracking sessions, participants completed a masked-recall exercise.; RESULTS: Overall, the responsibility or moderation messages were the least frequently viewed textual or visual areas of the advertisements. Participants spent an average of only .35 seconds, or 7% of the total viewing time, fixating on each responsibility message. Beverage bottles, product logos, and cartoon illustrations were the most frequently viewed elements of the advertisements. Among those participants who fixated at least once on an advertisement's warning message, only a relatively small percentage were able to recall its general concept or restate it verbatim in the masked recall test.; CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary responsibility or moderation messages failed to capture the attention of teenagers who participated in this study and need to be typographically modified to be more effective.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study adapts Andersen's Behavioral Model to determine if health sector market conditions affect vulnerable subgroups' use of alcohol, drug, and mental health services (ADM) differently than the general population, focusing specifically on community-level predisposing and enabling characteristics.; DATA SOURCES: Wave 2 data (2000-2001) from the Health Care for Communities study, supplemented with cases from wave 1 (1997-1998), were merged with area characteristics taken from Census, Area Resource File (ARF), and other data sources.; STUDY DESIGN: The study used four-level hierarchical logistic regression to examine access to ADM care from any provider and specialty ADM access. Interactions between community-level predisposing and enabling vulnerability characteristics with individual race/ethnicity, age, income category, and insurance type were explored.; PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nonwhites, the poor, uninsured, and elderly had lower likelihoods of service use, but interactions between race/ethnicity, income, age and insurance status with community-level vulnerability factors were not statistically significant for any service use. For ADM specialty care, those with Medicare, Medicaid, private fully managed, and private partially managed insurance, the likelihood of utilization was higher in areas with higher HMO penetration. However, for those with other insurance or no insurance plan, the likelihood of utilization was lower in areas with higher HMO penetration.; CONCLUSIONS: Community-level enabling factors explain part of the effect of disadvantaged status but, with the exception of the effect of HMO penetration on the relationship between insurance and specialty care use, do not modify any of the residual individual-level effects of disadvantage. Interventions targeting both structural and individual levels may be necessary to address the problem of health disparities. More research with longitudinal data is necessary to sort out the causal direction of social context and ADM access outcomes, and whether policy interventions to change health sector market conditions can shift ADM treatment utilization.

AB Malt liquor (ML) is a cheap, high alcohol content beverage that is marketed to appeal to young adults. Findings from the few published studies of ML use suggest that it may be associated with excessive drinking, alcohol problems, and the use of illicit drugs. The authors conducted separate hierarchical multiple regressions to examine the role of ML use and psychosocial variables (e.g., personality, ML motives) in alcohol-related problems and marijuana use. Demographic characteristics served as controls. The sample consisted of 639 (456 men, 183 women) young adults (M = 22.9 years, SD = 4.2) who regularly (> or =40 oz/week) consumed ML. ML use significantly and positively predicted alcohol problems, ML-specific problems, and marijuana use, above and beyond their associations with typical alcohol use. Marijuana was the illicit drug of choice, and 46% reported concurrent use of marijuana and ML. Those who concurrently used ML and marijuana began drinking at a younger age and reported more substance use (particularly marijuana) and more alcohol-related problems than did non-concurrent users. These results suggest that ML use may represent a risk for alcohol problems and marijuana use.

AB PURPOSE: To determine whether early adolescents who are exposed to alcohol marketing are subsequently more likely to drink. Recent studies suggest that exposure to alcohol ads has a limited influence on drinking in mid-adolescence. Early adolescents may be more vulnerable to alcohol advertising effects.; METHODS: Two in-school surveys of 1786 South Dakota youth measured exposure to television beer advertisements, alcohol ads in magazines, in-store beer displays and beer concessions, radio-listening time, and ownership of beer promotional items during 6th grade, and drinking intentions and behavior at 7th grade. Multivariate regression equations predicted the two drinking outcomes using the advertising exposure variables and controlling for psychosocial factors and prior drinking.; RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, the joint effect of exposure to advertising from all six sources at grade 6 was strongly predictive of grade 7 drinking and grade 7 intentions to drink. Youth in the 75th percentile of alcohol marketing exposure had a predicted probability of drinking that was 50% greater than that of youth in the 25th percentile.; CONCLUSIONS: Although causal effects are uncertain, policy makers should consider limiting a variety of marketing practices that could contribute to drinking in early adolescence.

AB In the last years an extremely rapid massive diffusion of the cell phones is occurred. Currently in Italy, as in many other countries, almost all the youngsters and a lot of adults possess a cell phones. This device is enormously useful, but its use can determine negative effects on the user's attention, i.e. during vehicle driving. Numerous epidemiological studies show that cell phone use in driving determines a relative risk of causing a road accident around 4 (equivalent to driving with 0.8 g/l blood alcohol concentration), for both hands-held and hands-free devices. This risk doesn't seem well perceived from the Italian drivers: as our surveys show, the 2.5% of them use a cellular hands-held while driving. This situation appears to evolve toward more critical conditions, given the quick diffusion of ever more technologically advanced instruments, such as video-cell phones, mostly capable of capturing the attention, or TV-cell phones, with which the distracting occasions could be more frequent and prolonged. The use of the cell phone seems to imply an important risk for pedestrians: the first results of the monitoring results that we are producing on this matter in Rome show that the 5.5% of the pedestrians cross the road while talking with a hands-held cell phones, in the most of cases ignoring the traffic conditions at all. All this facts show the urgency to promote specific actions of prevention, in absence of which it is reasonable to foresee a consistent growth in the number of road traffic accidents. In our opinion it is necessary to capillarily inform the public of the signalled risks, possibly also in the advertising spaces of the producers and managers of the cellular telephony, apart obvious repressive actions on the use of the cell phones during the guide of a vehicle.

AB Research indicates that cannabis continues to be a popular illegal drug internationally. Furthermore, adolescent rates of use appear to be significant. Whilst the non-acute effect of cannabis use on adult cognition has been extensively researched, there has been less examination of adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the non-acute relationship between cannabis and cognitive function in a sample of adolescents with a continuum of cannabis use, taking into account additional predictor variables (psychiatric functioning, general functioning, demographics and other drug use). Seventy adolescents were recruited from clinical and community sources as well as through newspaper advertisements. After 12 hours abstinence from cannabis, adolescents completed a two-hour interview covering: demographics; alcohol and drug use history; drug use in the past 28 days; depression; further psychiatric functioning (including ADHD and Conduct Disorder); and cognitive functioning as measured by computerised tasks (CANTAB) and traditional pen and paper tests. Adolescents who were regular cannabis users (more than once a week) had a significantly poorer performance on four measures of cognitive function reflecting attention, spatial working memory and learning. Cannabis use remained an independent predictor of performance on the working memory and strategy measures after additional predictor variables were included in a multivariate regression analysis. The results suggest that aspects of adolescent cognitive function are independently related to the frequency of cannabis use beyond acute intoxication.

AB That childhood obesity is an alarming public health problem is clear and widely appreciated. What is altogether unclear is what our society should do about it. Some people think the solution lies in using tort law to sue McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and other corporations. We reject that notion. Others believe that government should order specific changes in the behavior of food companies and school officials--and yet, there is little reason for confidence that these "command and control" strategies will make a difference. Instead, we propose "performance-based regulation" of the food industry. This is analogous to the approach our country is now taking with respect to elementary and secondary education (most prominently in the No Child Left Behind legislation). Schools are not told how to achieve better educational results, but better outcomes are demanded of them. This strategy has also been used in the environmental context to reduce harmful power plant emissions, and it has been briefly proposed as a way of regulating cigarette companies. In this Article, we propose that large firms selling food and drink that is high in sugar or fat will be assigned the responsibility of reducing obesity rates in a specific pool of children. A firm's share of the overall responsibility will be based on its share of the "bad' food market, and the children assigned to it will be organized by geographically proximate schools where obesity rates are currently above the plan's nationwide target rate of 8 percent (the actual childhood obesity rate today is approximately 16 percent). Firms that fail to achieve their goals will be subject to serious financial penalties.

The Florida Prevention Research Center has worked with a community coalition in Sarasota County, Florida to define locally important health problems and issues and to develop responsive health-promotion interventions. The CBPM framework has evolved as academic and community-based researchers have gained experience applying it. Community boards can use marketing principles to design evidence-based strategies for addressing local public health concerns. Based on 6 years of experience with the "Believe in All Your Possibilities" program, lessons learned that have led to revision and improvement of the CBPM framework are described.

AB International trade, population migration, changes in living conditions (i.e., consumption transition, nutritional transition), and changes in production, marketing, and availability of consumer goods (i.e., production transition) have brought about continuous and rapid changes in the human environment. Such changes have improved the health and economic status of many people in developing countries. At the same time, a parallel phenomenon is occurring: the rapid emergence and expansion of modifiable risk behaviors. These behaviors adversely affect the national health of developing countries and that of future generations because of their impact on maternal, child, and adolescent health. Furthermore, these behaviors are increasing at a faster rate than interventions to curb their growth are being implemented. We discuss the current status of five modifiable risk behaviors--alcohol consumption, tobacco use, overweight and obesity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, and physical inactivity--to emphasize the need for global advocacy and local action to enhance policy formulation and diffusion of interventions necessary to moderate the spread of these behaviors.

Logistic regressions compared the odds of ever (vs. never) drinking and current (vs. ever) drinking after controlling for psychosocial and other risk factors for adolescent alcohol use.; RESULTS: Two-thirds of middle school students reported at least weekly visits to liquor, convenience, or small grocery stores where alcohol advertising is widespread. Such exposure was associated with higher odds of ever drinking, but was not associated with current drinking. One-fifth of students reported owning at least one alcohol promotional item. These students were three times more likely to have ever tried drinking and 1.5 times more likely to report current drinking than students without such items.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clear evidence of an association of adolescent drinking with weekly exposure to alcohol advertising in stores and with ownership of alcohol promotional items. Given their potential influence on adolescent drinking behaviour, retail ads, and promotional items for alcohol deserve further study.

AB BACKGROUND: Alcohol advertising is a powerful factor of incitation to consumption. We analyzed the alcohol advertising, especially that youth-focused, in written mass media in Spain during the period 2002-2006.; METHODS: Annual cross-sectional study of advertisements in 41 widely difused written mass media (average readers: 10,1 millions).; RESULTS: Media admitting alcohol publicity were 29% in the whole. (2,9 millions of readers on average, 29% of total readers). Alcohol advertising constituted the 3,8% of global publicity and the 8,6% of the publicity in media admitting alcohol publicity. In this period only 4% of the media (2,4% of total readers) inserted antidrug campaigns. In brief, three out of 10 total readers and one out of 12 people older than 15 years suffered the impact of tobacco advertising. Young people were included in 33% of alcohol advertisements and 3 out of 6 of youth-oriented magazines permitted a such publicity.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol publicity remains high in written mass media in Spain. By contrast few people received informative antidrug campaigns. Advertising was preferentially directed to young people.

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of knowledge relating to UK 'Sensible Drinking' guidelines, definitions of binge drinking and attitude to drink labelling initiatives amongst female school leavers enrolling at university.; METHODS: Non-standardized questionnaires were administered and completed by researchers during the process of matriculation (response rate 94%; n = 180).; RESULTS: The survey revealed that recommended daily guidelines for women were not recalled by 54% of participants; 52% could not quote the unit content of their favoured alcoholic drink, whereas only 14% reported the use of the UK unit system to guide drinking. Personal quantitative definitions of binge drinking varied by a factor of 18.; CONCLUSION: A rewording of the UK Sensible Drinking message to one recognizing the needs of different population groups and their particular language of consumption measure is timely.

Height and body weight were measured and Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated; >or= p85 = overweight and >or= p95 = obesity. A questionnaire for assessment of leisure time, physical activity, time spent watching TV and eating habits was administered.; RESULTS: Overweight and obesity were more common in the higher economic level than in the lower economic one; 31.4% versus 18.1% ; p < 0.001. Leisure time for physical activity was more present in adolescents with A(1), A(2) e B(1) economic status. Watching TVdisclosed no difference between the two economic levels surveyed. Daily consumption of softs drinks, sweets and salty snacks were more common in the higher economic level but this was not associated with obesity. A low consumption of fruits was observed in all economic levels.; CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity are frequent among adolescents of Campina Grande, PB, as well as time spent watching TV and unhealthy eating habits, especially among those of the higher economic level.. The amount of time spent on leisure for physical activities was low, especially in the lower economic level.

AB BACKGROUND: To examine the extent and nature of alcohol imagery on New Zealand (NZ) television, a content analysis of 98 hours of prime-time television programs and advertising was carried out over 7 consecutive days' viewing in June/July 2004. The main outcome measures were number of scenes in programs, trailers and advertisements depicting alcohol imagery; the extent of critical versus neutral and promotional imagery; and the mean number of scenes with alcohol per hour, and characteristics of scenes in which alcohol featured.; RESULTS: There were 648 separate depictions of alcohol imagery across the week, with an average of one scene every nine minutes. Scenes depicting uncritical imagery outnumbered scenes showing possible adverse health consequences of drinking by 12 to 1.; CONCLUSION: The evidence points to a large amount of alcohol imagery incidental to storylines in programming on NZ television. Alcohol is also used in many advertisements to market non-alcohol goods and services. More attention needs to be paid to the extent of alcohol imagery on television from the industry, the government and public health practitioners. Health education with young people could raise critical awareness of the way alcohol imagery is presented on television.

AB Countless barriers come between people who are struggling with substance abuse and those charged with providing substance abuse treatment. The check-up, a form of motivational enhancement therapy, is a harm reduction intervention that offers a manner of supporting individuals by lowering specific barriers to reaching those who are untreated. The check-up was originally developed to reach problem drinkers who were neither seeking treatment nor self-initiating change. The intervention, marketed as an opportunity to take stock of one's experiences, involves an assessment and personalized feedback delivered with a counseling style termed motivational interviewing. Check-ups can be offered in care settings to individuals who, as a result of screening, manifest risk factors for specific disorders such as alcoholism. They can also be free-standing and publicized widely to the general public. This paper will discuss illustrations of in-person, computerized, in-school, and telephone applications of the free-standing type of check-up with reference to alcohol consumers, adult and adolescent marijuana smokers, and gay/bisexual males at risk for sexual transmission of HIV. The paper's major focus is to highlight how unique features of each application have the potential of reducing barriers to reaching specific at-risk populations. Also considered are key policy issues such as how check-up services can be funded, which venues are appropriate for the delivery of check-up interventions, pertinent competency criteria in evaluating staff who deliver this intervention, how marketing can be designed to reach contemplators in untreated at-risk populations, and how a check-up's success ought to be defined.

AB Binge drinking is a pattern of heavy drinking which is observed all over Europe. The term Binge drinking implies a lot of different meanings to different people. The most popular definition used for this term is five or more 'standard drinks' in a single occasion. Binge drinking is different from intoxication, although this kind of heavy alcohol consumption can be lead to intoxication. This condition is manifested by different signs, for example slurred speech. Binge drinking is very common among the European population. In 2006 some 80 million Europeans aged 15 plus reported this kind of alcohol consumption patterns. European surveys showed that there is an increase of binge drinking across Europe amongst young people (15-16 years) old since 1995. The consequences of binge drinking contain acute and chronic effects, which are caused by long term alcohol use. The individual risks are brain damage, suicide, sexually transmitted diseases, etc. It has also an impact on harm to others than the drinkers. This includes violence and crime, accidents, etc. Each year in the European Union 2000 homicides are related to heavy drinking. There a lot of effective measures to reduce binge drinking. Strong evidence is shown by drink-driving laws, tax, reduced access to and availability of alcohol, brief interventions such as physician advice and advertising controls.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and content of alcoholic beverage advertisements and sales promotions in magazines popular with adolescents and young people in Australia, and assess the extent to which the ads complied with Australia's self-regulatory Alcoholic Beverages Advertising Code (ABAC). Alcohol advertisements and promotions were identified in a sample of 93 magazines popular with young people. The identified items were coded against 28 measures constructed to assess the content of the items against the five sections of the ABAC. Two thirds of the magazines contained at least one alcohol advertisement or promotion with a total of 142 unique items identified: 80 were brand advertisements and 62 were other types of promotional items (i.e. sales promotions, event sponsorships, cross promotions with other marketers and advertorials). It was found that 52% of items appeared to contravene at least one section of the ABAC. The two major apparent breaches related to section B--the items having a strong appeal to adolescents (34%) and to section C--promoting positive social, sexual and psychological expectancies of consumption (28%). It was also found that promotional items appeared to breach the ABAC as often as did advertisements. It is concluded that the self-regulating system appears not to be working for the alcoholic beverages industry in Australia and that increased government surveillance and regulation should be considered, giving particular emphasis to the inclusion of promotional items other than brand advertising.

AB UNLABELLED: Adolescent suicide is a major social and medical problem. Alcohol use disorders with comorbid major depression represent an especially high-risk profile for suicidal behavior, repeated suicidal behavior and completed suicide. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics, prevalence of interpersonal triggers and the number of triggers for suicidal behavior in depressed late adolescents and young adults with or without comorbid alcohol use disorders.; METHODS: 18-26-year-old subjects were recruited through advertising and referrals and participated in mood disorders research in a university hospital. Thirty-eight depressed suicide attempters without a history of any alcohol or substance abuse/dependence and 29 depressed suicide attempters with comorbid alcohol abuse or dependence participated in the study. Demographic and clinical parameters including parameters related to suicidal behavior were examined and recorded.; RESULTS: There was no difference with regard to demographic parameters between the two groups. Depressed suicide attempters with comorbid alcohol use disorders had higher aggression and impulsivity scale scores and were more likely to be tobacco smokers compared to their counterparts without alcohol use disorders. Additionally, there was a trend towards higher lethality of suicide attempts in subjects with alcohol use disorders compared to the other group. We found no difference in the prevalence of interpersonal triggers or in the number of triggers for suicidal behavior between the two groups.; CONCLUSION: It appears that among 18-26-year-old depressed suicide attempters, individuals with comorbid alcohol use disorders are more impaired with regard to aggressiveness and impulsivity compared to persons without comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence.

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe how nutrition behaviours and physical activity are associated with body mass index (BMI) among New Zealand children and to determine if these relationships vary by ethnicity.; METHODS: Data were collected during the 2002 National Children's Nutrition Survey. 3250 children provided information about their eating and activity behaviours and anthropometric measurements.; RESULTS: Approximately 31% of New Zealand children aged 5 to 14 years were overweight/obese, with the highest prevalences of overweight/obesity among Pacific children (62%) and Maori children (41%). Higher prevalences of obesity were also observed among females and children experiencing socioeconomic deprivation. Television use, buying school food from the dairy/takeaway shops, skipping breakfast, consumption of fruit drinks/soft drinks, and low physical activity were associated with BMI in analyses controlling for demographic characteristics among the total population. Buying school food from the dairy/takeaway (p=0.04) and skipping breakfast (p=0.007) retained significance when all nutrition behaviours and physical activity were analysed simultaneously. Significant interactions between ethnicity and bringing school food from home and buying school food from school were observed in relation to BMI. In most cases, the relationships were most significant for Pacific children.; CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to address childhood obesity among all New Zealand children should primarily include efforts to increase breakfast consumption and decrease food purchases away from home. Given the high rates of obesity between Pacific and Maori children, targeted interventions are warranted and should include strategies to improve the school food environment.

AB Increase in extramarital sex among youths, gender-based violence, lack of contraceptive knowledge among newly married couples and lack of knowledge of protection against diseases like STIs/HIV are the information and service needs of young people that need to be addressed urgently in order to make them future knowledgeable, responsible, and non-violent partners. In addressing these needs the gatekeepers, including parents, formal and informal community leaders and teachers, play a critical role, by facilitating/hindering access to appropriate and correct information about sexual and reproductive health to young people. The study was conducted in a district of Uttaranchal, India. The specific objective was to understand the social context and gatekeepers' views on family planning and sexual and reproductive health needs of young men. Thirty-two in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted with parents, formal and informal community leaders, teachers, and selected development officials. The findings indicate that gatekeepers are worried about rapid changes in the aspiration, expectation, and behavior of young men. Most of them were seriously concerned about the increasing drinking habit, use of drugs, and changing values of sexuality leading to various risk behaviors among young men. They felt that many of these changes are consequences of wider societal changes, rising aspirations, explosion of electronic media, and globalization of a new youth culture where extramarital sex, alcohol consumption, and violence are expressions of different facets of masculinity and symbols of the affluent class. Overall, there was a feeling that TV/films and their peers now influence more the socialization of young people and parents are losing control in guidance and mentoring of their children.

AB INTRODUCTION: The crash risk of teens is high, with fatal crash rates of teen drivers higher than any other age group. New approaches to reduce teen traffic fatalities are clearly needed.; METHOD: A possible approach to reduce the incidence of teen driver crashes and fatalities is through the use of vehicle-based intelligent driver support systems. To be most effective, the system should address the behaviors associated with an overwhelming number of teen fatal crashes: speed, low seatbelt use, and alcohol impairment. In-vehicle technology also offers an opportunity to address the issue of inexperience through enforcement of certain Graduated Driver's License provisions.; RESULTS: To fully understand the capability of such technologies, there should be a concerted effort to further their development, and human factors testing should take place to understand their effects on the driver.; IMPACT: If successfully implemented, a Teen Driver Support System (TDSS), such as the one described here, could significantly decrease the number of teens killed in traffic crashes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Study the incidence of drug abuse in persons with unnatural deaths such as traffic accidents, homicide with gunshot wounds, etc.; MATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred and fifty three cases with a mean age of 34 years (range 10 to 76) were studied. The decedents were mostly male (92%), with a variety of occupations including laborers (76.9%), traders (15.4%), and student (7.7%). The causes of death were mainly traffic injuries (33%), gunshot wounds (26%) and others (stab wound, poisoning, asphyxia etc 41%). The manner of death was accidents in 40% and homicides in 28%.; RESULTS: Nine percent were positive for methamphetamine or amphetamine derivatives. Tests for Heroin, 6-MAM, morphine, or cocaine were also performed but not detected. The drug positive cases were mostly males (85%) with the most common age range of 21-30 years (35.4%) and 61% with only primary education. Homicide by gunshot wounds was the most common cause of death at 69.2%, followed by hanging (15.4%), electrocution (7.7%), and poisoning (7.7%). The concentration of methamphetamine in urine was between 501-61,147 ng/ml, which cannot be correlated with intoxication. There were no deaths from overdose. Three Benzodiazepine, one toluene, and one meperidine cases were also found in cases of methamphetamine abuse. Alcohol was found mostly in the persons with unnatural deaths (53.6%) from traffic accidents.; CONCLUSION: This information helps us understand the marketing strategies, and the trading routes. All data will be used for planning to eradicate these drugs from Thailand in line with government strategies.

AB A landmark in health promotion in Thailand came in 2001 with the launching of the Universal Health Coverage Scheme at the cost of approximately USD 2 billion a year. Another important event was the establishment of the Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth) as a health promotion funding mechanism that draws upon a 2 percent surcharge levied on alcohol and tobacco excise tax, approximately USD 50-60 million a year. The most significant institutional development is the promulgation of the National Health Act in 2007. The Act embraces the principle of human rights and key principles of the Ottawa Charter in 2005. It is a result of five years of extensive public dialogues on important health issues that enhanced public awareness and nation wide networking on health promotion. ThaiHealth regards itself as a catalyst for health promotion. The organisation collaborates with all sectors of the society, from the national to the grassroots level, and is the most notable organisation for health promotion in Thailand. ThaiHealth funds programs on health risks/issues such as alcohol, tobacco, accidents, exercise, as well as area or setting based programs, for example, school, work place, community, and programs that target specific population groups such as the youth, the elderly, Muslim community. The open grants program invites proposals from all kinds of organizations/groups interested in launching health promotion initiatives. The endeavour has started to bear fruit. Smoking and alcohol consumption rates have dropped and more people have become health conscious and do more exercise. However, much remains to be done as some population groups especially the youth have become susceptible to various kinds of health risks. This remarkable start must be sustained and reinforced by the continuation and expansion of knowledge generation and dissemination, relentless policy advocacy and creative public campaign, with a strong health promotion network as the most critical success factor.

AB Insulin resistance caused by obesity and lack of physical activity plays a major role for the development of type 2 diabetes. If the reduced insulin action cannot be compensated by overproduction of insulin, glucose regulation disorder is developing. In addition, other trigger factors such as television viewing, sleep, alcohol or smoking are discussed. During the past years an intensification of pharmacological therapy was believed to be the major goal for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, now the value of nonpharmacological treatment improves. While in the past only nutrition was in the view of lifestyle research, recently a number of studies on the value of physical activity were published. In this paper an overview of recent studies showing the therapeutic potential of nonpharmacological therapies will be given. It will also be shown that these measures will not only optimize hyperglycaemia but also all other cardiovascular risk factors.

AB Despite the huge number of drugs on the market and recent advances in pharmacotherapy, only a few substances are available for the prevention of gastrointestinal tumors--most of which are not approved for this indication or not validated in appropriately designed randomized trials. General recommendations include lifestyle modifications such as avoidance of smoking, only moderate consumption of alcohol, regular physical exercise and a nutrition rich in fresh fruits and vegetables with limited meat. A global eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori would be desirable to prevent gastric carcinoma, but this does not seem feasible from the socio-economic point of view. Therefore, at least patients at high risk should be screened and this pathogen eradicated, preferentially in their youth. Hepatitis B vaccination of newborns to prevent the development of hepatocellular carcinoma has already been established in Germany; a specific antiviral therapy should be offered to all patients with hepatitis B or C infections, taking into consideration the risks associated with this treatment. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to prevent gastrointestinal malignancies cannot generally be recommended and should be restricted to patients at high risk and to clinical studies. However, the appropriate substance, dose and duration of NSAID therapy are still being debated.

AB The objective of this study was to describe the extent and locations of soft drink advertisements on high school campuses in Pennsylvania and identify factors related to extent of these advertisements. Surveys were distributed to 271 school foodservice directors in a random sample of high schools in Pennsylvania. These high schools were selected to be representative of the entire population of high schools in Pennsylvania based on chosen demographic characteristics. A three-phase survey strategy was used, involving distribution of a postcard reminder 1 to 2 weeks after the initial survey distribution, and mailing of a second survey to nonrespondents 1 to 2 weeks after mailing of the postcard. Two hundred twenty-eight school foodservice directors (84%) returned surveys. Linear multiple regression analyses were done using SPSS (version 11.5.1, 2002, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Approximately two thirds (66.5%) of respondents indicated soft drink advertisements exist in at least one location in their school, with the most prevalent locations being on vending machines (62%) and school grounds, such as playing fields (27%). Slightly more than 10% of respondents indicated soft drink advertisements displayed in the cafeteria. Extent of soft drink advertisement locations was positively related to existence of a pouring-rights contract, subscription to Channel One, and receipt of incentives from soft drink bottlers based on sales, but negatively related to average daily participation in school lunch. These findings suggest that commercialization and sales incentives might interact to contribute to school environments that are not "nutrition-friendly." Schools' efforts to establish wellness policies as mandated by the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 provide ideal opportunities to examine school environments for advertising that might conflict with the healthful environments they are aiming to establish, and perhaps to develop policies to address these practices.

AB Advertising is a pervasive influence on children and adolescents. Young people view more than 40,000 ads per year on television alone and increasingly are being exposed to advertising on the Internet, in magazines, and in schools. This exposure may contribute significantly to childhood and adolescent obesity, poor nutrition, and cigarette and alcohol use. Media education has been shown to be effective in mitigating some of the negative effects of advertising on children and adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: This prospective study examines the association of educational status in 1984 and the risk for past-year Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) in 1994, 10 years later.; METHOD: A sample of 8,661 respondents was drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience in Youth. Measures included baseline heavy episodic drinking, alcohol-dependence symptoms, early problem behaviors (antisocial behaviors, illicit substance use, family history of alcoholism, and age at onset of alcohol use), demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age, marital status), and 1994 assessment for past-year DSM-IV AUDs.; RESULTS: Findings from this 10-year prospective study indicate that education beyond high school had a protective effect for alcohol dependence, and dropping out of high school resulted in an elevated long-term risk for alcohol dependence. These associations remained significant when other early behavioral problems were included in the models.; CONCLUSIONS: The risk of alcohol dependence and, consequently, the need for appropriately tailored prevention efforts is greater among high school dropouts and college nonattenders than among college students, although much of the current literature has focused on the latter.

AB PURPOSE: To support efforts to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), population-based data are needed on the prevalence of alcohol use at any time during gestation, particularly among women who were recent and at-risk drinkers.; METHODS: We used National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experiences in Youth (NLSY) files to estimate the prevalence of any drinking during pregnancy and to evaluate alcohol history risk factors among 6676 births reported by women with prepregnancy drinking data. Prevalence estimates were obtained for 2-year intervals for all 1982-1995 births and for subsets with prepregnancy recent and at-risk drinking.; RESULTS: Among all births, drinking during pregnancy declined from 38.3% in 1982-1983 to 23.0% in 1994-1995 (p < 0.0001). Drinking during pregnancy also declined over time among recent and at-risk drinkers (p < 0.0001), but the 1994-1995 prevalences were still high (39.3% and 29.0%, respectively). Adjusted logistic models confirmed both the decrease in risk for the later birth years and the persistent heightened risk for births among recent and at-risk drinkers.; CONCLUSIONS: In addition to ongoing universal prevention strategies that have helped reduce the prevalence of drinking during pregnancy, selective and indicated prevention approaches are needed to encourage abstinence during pregnancy among recent and at-risk drinkers.

AB BACKGROUND: Simultaneous use of alcohol and cannabis predicts increased negative consequences for users beyond individual or even concurrent use of the two drugs. Given the widespread use of the drugs and common simultaneous consumption, problems unique to simultaneous use may bear important implications for many substance users. Cognitive expectancies offer a template for future drug use behavior based on previous drug experiences, accurately predicting future use and problems. Studies reveal similar mechanisms underlying both alcohol and cannabis expectancies, but little research examines simultaneous expectancies for alcohol and cannabis use. Whereas research has demonstrated unique outcomes associated with simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use, this study hypothesized that unique cognitive expectancies may underlie simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use.; RESULTS: This study examined a sample of 2600 (66% male; 34% female) Internet survey respondents solicited through advertisements with online cannabis-related organizations. The study employed known measures of drug use and expectancies, as well as a new measure of simultaneous drug use expectancies. Expectancies for simultaneous use of alcohol and cannabis predicted simultaneous use over and above expectancies for each drug individually.; DISCUSSION: Simultaneous expectancies may provide meaningful information not available with individual drug expectancies. These findings bear potential implications on the assessment and treatment of substance abuse problems, as well as researcher conceptualizations of drug expectancies. Policies directing the treatment of substance abuse and its funding ought to give unique consideration to simultaneous drug use and its cognitive underlying factors.

AB Three hundred and six sexually experienced adolescents participated in a study on sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence and associated risk factors. The prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoea (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and syphilis was 4.5%, 9%, 8% and 4% for females and 4.7%, 5.7%, 0% and 2.8% for males. HIV-seropositivity was found in 15.2% of females and 5.8% of males. Structured face-to-face interviews were used to obtain information about social background, sexual experience and genital symptoms. Four focus-group discussions were used in order to validate the interview data. Females were more likely to be infected by the four treatable STIs and HIV, despite risky behavior being more common among males. Unemployment, little formal education, the presence of bacterial STIs and post-coital bleeding or a bad smell from the vagina was highly associated with the risk for HIV in females. The higher prevalence of STIs, including HIV, among adolescent girls cannot be explained by sexual behavior only, as boys reported more risk behavior and were still less affected by STIs. Biological and social factors are definitely of importance.

Interviews immediately following the training by nurses were conducted on 220 clients, of whom 168 (76%) reported being taught both procedures during their clinic visit. After 2 weeks, free chlorine residuals were present in stored drinking water in 67 out of 98 (68%) clients' homes and, 1 year later, in 36 out of 51 (71%) clients' homes. After 2 weeks, all six hand-washing steps were correctly demonstrated by 41 (44%) out of 93 clients, and by 17 out of 51 (34%) 1 year later. This brief, practical intervention shows promise for vulnerable populations.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report on a new modelling approach developed for the assessing cost-effectiveness in obesity (ACE-Obesity) project and the likely population health benefit and strength of evidence for 13 potential obesity prevention interventions in children and adolescents in Australia.; METHODS: We used the best available evidence, including evidence from non-traditional epidemiological study designs, to determine the health benefits as body mass index (BMI) units saved and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved. We developed new methods to model the impact of behaviours on BMI post-intervention where this was not measured and the impacts on DALYs over the child's lifetime (on the assumption that changes in BMI were maintained into adulthood). A working group of stakeholders provided input into decisions on the selection of interventions, the assumptions for modelling and the strength of the evidence.; RESULTS: The likely health benefit varied considerably, as did the strength of the evidence from which that health benefit was calculated. The greatest health benefit is likely to be achieved by the 'Reduction of TV advertising of high fat and/or high sugar foods and drinks to children', 'Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding' and the 'multi-faceted school-based programme with an active physical education component' interventions.; CONCLUSIONS: The use of consistent methods and common health outcome measures enables valid comparison of the potential impact of interventions, but comparisons must take into account the strength of the evidence used. Other considerations, including cost-effectiveness and acceptability to stakeholders, will be presented in future ACE-Obesity papers. Information gaps identified include the need for new and more effective initiatives for the prevention of overweight and obesity and for better evaluations of public health interventions.

AB Adolescent suicide is today a public health problem among the leading cause of mortality among adolescents and young adults. There seems to be many reasons for this increase (which has different trends in different populations), but associations have been found with increased substance abuse, television and video violence, socio-economic status and easy access to firearms. Gender differences have also been observed with crime, suicide and substance abuse higher among males, while eating disorder, depression and suicidal behavior more prevalent among females. This paper will review prevalence and incidence of adolescent suicidal behavior, socio-demographic and psychological risk factors, associated cognitive factors and socio-economic factors. Risk factors include previous suicide attempts, a history of others in the family who have been suicidal, mental illness, alcohol and drug use, and other self-destructive behaviors as well as consideration being given to hopelessness, hostility, negative self-concept and isolation. At the individual difference level, factors such as trait depression, anger and hostility, perfectionism and social sensitivity would seem critical variables, as would age, gender and intellectual functioning. Sociological and family-related factors may also be implicated including dysfunctional family organizations, a history of physical or psychological abuse (sexual abuse) and limited extent of social support networks. A frequently reported precipitating event of suicidal behavior is family adversity including rejection, separation and interpersonal conflict. At a socio-economic level it would seem essential to provide comprehensive document about the social and economic conditions from which the adolescent comes.

AB BACKGROUND: Following the marketing ban of ephedra-containing supplements in April 2004, many manufacturers substituted the herb Citrus aurantium for ephedra and marketed the products as "ephedra-free" supplements. Extracts of C. aurantium contain synephrine, a sympathomimetic alkaloid.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of consumption of dietary supplements containing C. aurantium in California during 2004.; METHODS: We used the 2004 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey to determine the prevalence of consumption of dietary supplements containing C. aurantium in California during 2004.; RESULTS: Two percent (n = 70) of the 4140 survey respondents reported taking a dietary supplement containing C. aurantium in the previous year. Reasons stated included energy enhancement, weight loss, and appetite suppression. Compared with nonusers, users were more likely to report being single, aged 18-34 years, and Hispanic; consuming 3 or more alcoholic drinks on days that they imbibed; and having a heavier body mass index. Among the 5 users who reported experiencing an adverse event that they attributed to the supplement, 3 indicated that the severity was mild.; CONCLUSIONS: Given that supplements containing ephedra were banned in April 2004, the results from this study may serve as a baseline estimate against which future studies of the use of C. aurantium products may be compared.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in youth exposure to alcohol advertising on television across different demographic groups.; METHODS: We used television ratings data on alcohol advertisements to examine trends in exposure between September 1998 and February 2002. Further, we explored the differences in exposure across demographic groups by examining group-level alcohol ad exposure across specific networks, program types, and times of day.; RESULTS: We found that boys were more exposed than girls and African-Americans are more exposed than whites. Moreover, the race differential appeared to be increasing over time, whereas the gender differential appeared to increase with age. Differences in viewing patterns across race and gender contributed to the observed differences in exposure to alcohol advertising on television.; CONCLUSIONS: These results provide guidance in identifying comparative vulnerabilities in exposure to alcohol advertising on television, and can aid in the development of strategies to inoculate youth against those vulnerabilities.

AB In the United States, more underage youth drink alcohol than smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Excessive alcohol consumption leads to many adverse health and social consequences and results in approximately 4,500 deaths among underage youth each year. Recent studies have emphasized the contribution of alcohol marketing to underage drinking and have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of alcohol advertising appears in media for which the audience composition is youth-oriented (i.e., composed disproportionately of persons aged 12-20 years). To determine the proportion of radio advertisements that occurred on radio programs with audiences composed disproportionately of underage youth and the proportion of total youth exposure to alcohol advertising that occurs as a result of such advertising, researchers at the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth (Health Policy Institute, Georgetown University, District of Columbia) evaluated the placement of individual radio advertisements for the most advertised U.S. alcohol brands and the composition of audiences in the largest 104 markets in the United States. This report summarizes the results of that study, which indicate that alcohol advertising is common on radio programs which have disproportionately large youth audiences and that this advertising accounts for a substantial proportion of all alcohol radio advertising heard by underage youth. These results further indicate that 1) the current voluntary standards limiting alcohol marketing to youth should be enforced and ultimately strengthened, and 2) ongoing monitoring of youth exposure to alcohol advertising should continue.

AB Dietary patterns have been identified in adults, but less is known about children and adolescents. For the first time, we have investigated lifestyle patterns combining diet and physical activity in 12-year-old French preadolescents and examined their association with sociodemographic factors. Physical activity, sedentary activities and dietary habits were assessed by questionnaires given to 2724 students in 2001. Family income tax and parents' educational level, as indicators of socio-economic status, and the size of the residence commune were obtained from parents. After adjusting for socio-economic status, physical activity was positively associated with a consumption of fruit/vegetables/fruit juice on more than four occasions in the previous 24 h (P<0.001). Sedentary activities were positively associated with the consumption of French fries or potato chips (P<0.001), with sweetened drink as the most usual drink (P<0.001) and with nibbling while watching television (P<0.001), and inversely associated with a high consumption of fruit/vegetables/fruit juice (P=0.04). Multiple correspondence analysis identified two independent axes and specific combinations of behaviour: one axis characterised by sedentary activity, sweetened drink as the most usual drink, the consumption of French fries or potato chips and nibbling while watching television; a second one associating physical activity and the consumption of fruit/vegetables/fruit juice. Both socio-economic proxies were associated with the former axis (P<0.001). The size of the residence commune was associated with the latter (P<0.1). Combinations of diet and physical activity habits were identified in adolescents, indicating that prevention programmes targeting both behaviours may have an enhanced outcome.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate the aggregation of health behaviors among fourth graders in northern Taiwan.; METHODS: This study conducted an analysis of data collected from the 2001 Child and Adolescent Behaviors in Long-term Evolution (CABLE) project, which included a sample of 2075 fourth grade students. Factor analysis and cluster analysis were used to investigate the aggregation patterns.; RESULTS: After factor analysis, we found that the 18 health behaviors could be grouped under five factors. These five factors were named: healthy behavior, rule-breaking behavior, substance use behavior, violent behavior, and pleasure-seeking behavior, according to the characteristics of the various health behaviors grouped under each of them. Each study subject was assigned points for each of these five factors and then cluster analysis was used to divide the subjects into four different clusters. The names of these clusters and the percentage of subjects within them were as follows: healthy group (43.47%), violent group (29.11%), pleasure-seeking group (22.55%), and rebellious group (4.87%).; CONCLUSIONS: A total of 56.53% of the study sample were grouped under unhealthy groups (violent group, pleasure-seeking group and rebellious group), which indicates that already more than half of the students had lifestyles that put their health at risk. It was suggested that health and educational organizations need to place importance on behavioral problems in children and adopt early prevention measures.

AB The purpose of this article was to review population-based interventions for preventing childhood obesity carried out in school settings published between 1999 and 2004. A total of 11 such interventions were found from USA and UK. The grade of the interventions was from kindergarten, primary grades, middle school to high school. Most of these interventions targeted both physical activity and nutrition behaviours although there were some interventions that focused on only one dimension such as TV watching or restricting drinking of carbonated drinks or increasing physical education time in the school. Most of the interventions were based on some behavioural theory and the most popular theory was social cognitive theory. Most of the interventions focused on individual level behaviour change approaches. Most of the interventions focused on short-term changes right after the intervention. On the whole, interventions resulted in modest changes in behaviours and mixed results with indicators of obesity. TV watching seems to be most modifiable behaviour, followed by physical activity and nutrition behaviours. The outcome measures such as lowered BMI (body mass index), triceps skin-fold thickness and waist circumference have not been measured by all studies. Recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of school-based childhood obesity interventions are presented.

AB CONTEXT: Previous research has found that exposure to violence in the home, community, and electronic media are associated with children's and adolescents' normative expectations concerning the use of violence and with other indicators of the violent behaviors by youth.; OBJECTIVE: Our purpose with this study was to examine the relationships between the frequency that high school students reported watching wrestling on television and engaging in date fighting, weapon carrying, and other fighting behaviors.; DESIGN: The initial analysis consisted of a cross-sectional study of a simple random sample of high school students, which was followed by a longitudinal analysis of these students over a 6- to 7-month period.; SETTING: The setting was all public high schools in 1 city/county system.; PARTICIPANTS: We used a simple random sample (N = 2228) of students.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variables included the frequency of date fighting during the previous 12 months and alcohol or other drug involvement associated with the last date fight.; RESULTS: There were significant correlations between frequency of watching wrestling on television during the previous 2 weeks and engaging in date fighting, fighting in general, and weapon carrying for both males and females, although the relationships were stronger among females than among males. The frequency of watching wrestling was highest among students reporting date fighting when either the victim or perpetrator had been drinking alcohol or using illegal drugs. When analyzed using logistic regression, the strongest relationships were observed between the frequency of watching wrestling and date-fight perpetration among females in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. These findings persisted after adjusting for multiple other factors.; CONCLUSIONS: For males and females, the frequency of watching wrestling was highest among students who fought with their dates when alcohol or other drugs were involved. The association between watching wrestling and date fighting was stronger among females than males. The relationship between watching wrestling on television and being the perpetrator of dating violence was also stronger among females and remained consistent over a 6- to 7-month time period.

AB OBJECTIVES: To explore how time spent watching television (TV) is associated with the dietary behaviours of New Zealand children and young adolescents.; DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: In homes or schools of New Zealand school students.; PARTICIPANTS: In total, 3275 children aged 5 to 14 years.; RESULTS: The odds of being overweight or obese increased with duration of TV viewing for children and adolescents when controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status and physical activity. Children and adolescents who watched the most TV were significantly more likely to be higher consumers of foods most commonly advertised on TV: soft drinks and fruit drinks, some sweets and snacks, and some fast foods. Both children and adolescents watching two or more hours of TV a day were more than twice as likely to drink soft drinks five times a week or more (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively), eat hamburgers at least once a week (both P = 0.02), and eat French fries at least once a week (both P < 0.01).; CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that longer duration of TV watching (thus, more frequent exposure to advertising) influences the frequency of consumption of soft drinks, some sweets and snacks, and some fast foods among children and young adolescents. Efforts to curtail the amount of time children spend watching TV may result in better dietary habits and weight control for children and adolescents. Future studies examining the impact of advertising on children's diets through interventions and international comparisons of legislation would provide more definitive evidence of the role of advertising in child and adolescent obesity.

AB AIMS: To investigate the prospective influence of social influence and social bonding variables on the development of alcohol outcome expectancies among adolescents with and without drinking experience.; DESIGN: Longitudinal data from students in the control schools of a field trial designed to evaluate a school-based drug prevention program.; SETTING: A total of 19 middle schools in South Dakota, USA.; MEASUREMENTS: An alcohol outcome expectancy scale administered to 1410 students in grades 8 and 9. After using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to develop an expectancies measure, multiple-group (grade 8 drinkers versus grade 8 non-drinkers) path analysis was used to model 9th grade alcohol expectancies. Grade 8 social influence and bonding variables were used as predictors, controlling for grade 8 expectancies.; FINDINGS: At the bivariate level, peer and adult influences and social bonding variables were related consistently to alcohol outcome expectancies among drinkers and non-drinkers. A bivariate relationship between alcohol advertising and alcohol expectancies was found among drinkers only. In the multivariate model, greater alcohol use by important adults predicted independently increased alcohol positivity among drinkers; greater perceived approval of alcohol use by parents and peers predicted diminished perceived potency of alcohol among non-drinkers. Advertisement exposure and social bonding variables were not independent predictors of alcohol expectancies in the multivariate model.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that attempts to alter adolescents' alcohol expectancies are likely to fail unless they address the influence of immediate social models on these beliefs.

AB The aims of the study were to examine the relationship between multiple victimisation and drug use, and the role of drug use and other intra-personal, peer, parental and environmental factors in predicting multiple victimisation among adolescents in South Africa. A cross-sectional design was employed. The participants comprised 1474 male and female adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years, from Durban and Cape Town. They completed questionnaire measures assessing demographic characteristics; self, peer and parental drug use; self and peer delinquency; parental child-centredness and rules; and community drug availability and exposure to violence on television. A measure of multiple victimisation assessed whether or not the respondents had experienced two or more different types of violence in their lifetime. There was a significant association between frequency of tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use and multiple victimisation. Significant predictors of multiple victimisation in multiple logistic regression analyses were variables within intra-personal, peer, parental and environmental domains. Victimisation prevention programmes in South Africa should be comprehensive and target adolescents' drug use as well as their other psychosocial risk factors.

AB The cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) subfamily (mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is responsible for metabolizing approximately half of currently marketed drugs, but with considerable interindividual variability in expression and function. To investigate factors contributing to this variability, rates of midazolam (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 protein content were determined using a set of 54 human liver microsomes (HLMs). Genetic factors investigated included CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes, CYP3A4 mRNA alternative splicing, and CYP3A4 transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites. Demographic and environmental factors investigated included age, gender, and histories of smoking and alcohol consumption. MDZ 1'-hydroxylation rates varied from 0.025 to 3.106 nmol/min/mg protein, with significant correlation to CYP3A4 protein content (r(s) = 0.92, P < 0.001) but less robust correlation to CYP3A5 protein content (r(s) = 0.60, P < 0.001). We identified eight CYP3A4 SNPs (five novel) and nine CYP3A5 SNPs (one novel), as well as seven CYP3A4 and two CYP3A5 haplotypes (all novel). No influence of genotype or haplotype on MDZ 1'-hydroxylation rate was observed, although CYP3A5*3A (g.6986a>g; g.31611c>t) carriers had lower CYP3A5 protein content compared with noncarriers (P = 0.004). No alternative splicing of CYP3A4 mRNA was found. Likewise, only a single transcriptional start site and polyadenylation site for CYP3A4 mRNA were identified. Subjects with a history of alcohol consumption had 2.2-fold higher median MDZ 1'-hydroxylation (P = 0.017), whereas no influence of age, gender, or smoking was evident. In conclusion, the investigated genetic factors did not contribute substantially to the large interindividual variability in midazolam hydroxylation, although alcohol consumption has a discernable but modest influence.

AB Obesity is considered a major Public Health issue in most developed countries nowadays for its wide spread across population groups, as well as its contribution to the development of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Available population data in Spain from the SEEDO'2000 study show a prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2)) of 14,5% in adults aged 25-60 years, estimates based on individual measurement of body weight and height. Obesity rates are higher among women aged 45 years and older, low social class, living in semi-urban places. Geographical distribution of the problem shows a trend for higher rates towards the South- SouthEast of the country, i.e. Andalucia, Murcia and the Canary Islands. Population data for Spanish children and young people based on the enKid study--cross-sectional study on a random national sample of the population aged 2-24 years--estimate a prevalence of obesity of 13.9% for the whole group. Geographical distribution draws a similar pattern to that described for adults. Higher peaks of the problem are identified between 9-13 years among boys from a low socioeconomical background. The analysis of determinants of obesity in Spanish children and young people show that overweight and obesity is related to absence of breastfeeding, low consumption of fruit and vegetables; high consumption of cakes and buns, soft drinks and butchery products, low physical activity levels and a positive association with time spent watching TV. The joint consensus document produced by the Spanish Association of Pediatrics (AEP), Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) and Spanish Society for the Study of Obesity (SEEDO) considers a global strategy for the prevention of obesity from early stages in life. The important role of the family and the school setting as well as the responsibility of the Health Administration and Pediatric care in the prevention of obesity is highlighted in the document.

AB The authors used social marketing to design and test advertisement components aimed at increasing students' interest in attending an alcohol program focused on reaching students who drink heavily, although the authors offered no such program. Participants were undergraduate students in introductory psychology courses (N = 551). Questionnaires included measures assessing demographic information, alcohol use and negative consequences, and interest in attending an alcohol program in response to exposure to 1 of 12 systematically varied advertisements. The authors found that approximately 20% of participants across all ad types indicated some level of interest in attending the alcohol program. Students who use alcohol reported more interest in attending when an informational message was used. Of the participants offered food, 41.9% indicated the food offered in the advertisement impacted their interest in attending. Results suggest market segmentation plays a role in developing effective advertisements to recruit different groups of students based on their reported drinking behavior.

AB OBJECTIVE: To know the family environment, living habits and social characteristics in 11-13 years-old school children.; METHODOLOGY: A descriptive transversal study performed in 65 schools of Barcelona during the second three-month, involving 2354 school children aged 11-13 interviewed by 73 pharmacists. The questionnaire has thirty-nine questions referring to family structure, eating and drinking habits, preferences, life style parameters such as physical activity and television viewing.; RESULTS: The survey revealed a family unit of two children and their parents was the most common. Only a 12% of the children surveyed lived with their grandparents. Furthermore, the findings revealed a low family presence during the three main meals on the working days, which increased on weekends, 26% on breakfast, 44% on lunch and 11% on dinner. A 24% had breakfast alone and the 46% ate what they wanted. About the afternoon snack, the 25% alone and the 55% what they wanted. A 60% never or practically never participated in decision making, when buying food. A 70% reported they did other activities while eating. Concretely, a 40, 39 and 59% of the children reported they had breakfast, lunch and dinner while watching television. The consumption frequency of trinkets, soft drinks and television viewing were lower for the children from private compared to public schools.; CONCLUSIONS: This study show that food choice at shopping was mainly done by the parents, however, children had an important role in making decisions of what food they eat and the activities they do while eating. Therefore, pharmacists could have a potential role to intervene in the nutritional education to parents and children.

AB OBJECTIVES: The RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center (RTI-UNC EPC) systematically reviewed the evidence on (a) the effectiveness of community- and population-based interventions to prevent tobacco use and to increase consumer demand for and implementation of effective cessation interventions; (b) the impacts of smokeless tobacco marketing on smoking, use of those products, and population harm; and (c) the directions for future research.; DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Applied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane libraries, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Psychological Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts from January 1980 through June 10, 2005. We included English-language randomized controlled trials, other trials, and observational studies, with sample size and follow-up restrictions. We used 13 Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews, 5 prior systematic reviews, and 2 meta-analyses as the foundation for this report.; REVIEW METHODS: Trained reviewers abstracted detailed data from included articles into evidence tables and completed quality assessments; other senior reviewers confirmed accuracy and resolved disagreements.; RESULTS: We identified 1,288 unique abstracts; 642 did not meet inclusion criteria, 156 overlapped with prior reviews, and 2 were not published articles. Of 488 full-text articles retrieved and reviewed, we excluded 298 for several reasons, marked 88 as background, and retained 102. Evidence (consistent with previous reviews) showed that (a) school-based prevention interventions have short-term (but not long-term) effects on adolescents; (b) multicomponent approaches, including telephone counseling, increase the number of users who attempt to quit; (c) self-help strategies alone are ineffective, but counseling and pharmacotherapy used either alone or in combination can improve success rates of quit attempts; and (d) provider training and academic detailing improve provider delivery of cessation treatments, but evidence is insufficient to show that these approaches yield higher quit rates. New evidence was insufficient to address the following: (a) effectiveness of population-based prevention interventions; (b) effectiveness of provider-based interventions to reduce tobacco initiation; (c) effectiveness of community- and provider-based interventions to increase use of proven cessation strategies; (d) effectiveness of marketing campaigns to switch tobacco users from smoking to smokeless tobacco products; and (e) effectiveness of interventions in populations with comorbidities and risk behaviors (e.g., depression, substance and alcohol abuse). No evidence was available on the way in which smokeless tobacco product marketing affects population harm.; CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base has notable gaps and numerous study deficiencies. We found little information to address some of the issues that previous authoritative reviews had not covered, some information to substantiate earlier conclusions and recommendations from those reviews, and no evidence that would overturn any previous recommendations.

AB This study investigates the effects of alcohol advertising on adolescent alcohol consumption. The theory of an industry response function and evidence from prior studies indicate the importance of maximizing the variance in advertising measures. Monitoring the Future (MTF) and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) data are augmented with alcohol advertising, originating on the market level, for five media. The large sample of the MTF allows estimation of race and gender-specific models. The longitudinal nature of the NLSY97 allows controls for unobserved heterogeneity with state-level and individual fixed effects. Price and advertising effects are generally larger for females relative to males. Controls for individual heterogeneity yield larger advertising effects, implying that the MTF results may understate the effects of alcohol advertising. Results from the NLSY97 suggest that a 28% reduction in alcohol advertising would reduce adolescent monthly alcohol participation from 25% to between 24 and 21%. For binge participation, the reduction would be from 12% to between 11 and 8%. The past month price-participation elasticity is estimated at -0.26, consistent with prior studies. The results show that reduction of alcohol advertising can produce a modest decline in adolescent alcohol consumption, though effects may vary by race and gender.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between behavioural factors, body adiposity and muscle mass.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 1415 Italian individuals (705 men and 710 women) aged 40-74 years from a population-based survey carried out in the town of Bollate (Milan). Analysis of covariance was used to refine and improve the precision of the comparisons.; RESULTS: Men: Smoking and sedentary behaviour were related to larger waist circumference (WC) and smaller hip circumference (HC). Increased WC was also associated with high-fat diet and moderate-to-heavy drinking (compared to light drinkers). Those more educated (completed high school) were leaner and ex-smokers had higher body mass index (BMI) than non-smokers. Women: BMI was inversely related with education, the more educated having also lower muscle mass. The light drinkers were leaner and moderate-to-heavy drinkers had less muscle mass than abstainers. Moderate-to-heavy drinkers had larger WC than light drinkers. A strong negative trend was found in the relationship between dietary fibre and WC. Overall adiposity (BMI) and, more weakly, HC and peripheral subcutaneous fat increased with more TV watching, whereas BMI lowered, together with WC and muscle mass (as measured by the mid-arm circumference), with more walking/cycling.; CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable habits such as smoking (men) and moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinking are associated with a pattern that is particularly deleterious to health: increased intra-abdominal fat and less muscle mass. Prevention strategies should be simultaneously aimed at promoting physical activities and reducing sedentary behaviours. A low-fat, fibre-rich diet seems to be closely related to a healthy distribution of body fat.

AB BACKGROUND: Sports sponsorship is a significant marketing tool. As such, it can promote products that pose risks to health (eg, high fat and high sugar foods) or it can promote health-supporting products (eg, sporting equipment and services). However, there is a lack of data on the proportion of sponsorship associated with "unhealthy" and "healthy" products and no methodology for systematically assessing it. This research aimed to explore this proportion with an Internet survey of sports sponsorship in the New Zealand setting.; METHODS: A search methodology was developed to identify Internet-based evidence of sports sponsorship at the national level and at the regional and club level in one specific region (Wellington). The top eight sports for 5-17-year-olds were selected and products and services of sponsors were classified in terms of potential public health impact (using a conservative approach).; RESULTS: Sponsorship of these popular sports was common at the national, regional and club levels (640 sponsors listed on 107 websites overall). Sports sponsorship associated with sponsors' products classified as "unhealthy" (eg, food high in fat and sugar, gambling and alcohol) were over twice as common as sponsorship associated with sponsors' products classified as "healthy" (32.7% (95% CI = 29.1, 36.5) versus 15.5% (95% CI = 12.8, 18.6) respectively). "Gambling" was the most common specific type of sponsorship (18.8%) followed by alcohol (11.3%). There were significantly more "alcohol" sponsors for rugby, compared to all the other sports collectively (rate ratio (RR) = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.60, 3.79), and for top male sports compared to female (RR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.05, 3.18). Also there was significantly more "unhealthy food" sponsorship for touch rugby and for "junior" teams/clubs compared to other sports collectively (RR = 6.54; 95% CI = 2.07, 20.69; and RR = 14.72, 95% CI = 6.22, 34.8; respectively). A validation study gave an inter-rater reliability for number of sponsors of 95% (n = 87 sponsors), and an inter-rater reliability of classification and categorisation of 100%.; CONCLUSION: This study found that the sponsorship of popular sports for young people is dominated by "unhealthy" sponsorship (ie, predominantly gambling, alcohol and unhealthy food) relative to "healthy" sponsorship. Governments may need to consider regulations that limit unhealthy sponsorship and/or adopt alternative funding mechanisms for supporting popular sports.

AB BACKGROUND: The alcohol industry spends over $5 billion a year on marketing, much of which is accessible to children. The distribution of branded articles of clothing and other personal items is one aspect of alcohol marketing that has not been adequately studied. In this study, the prevalence of ownership of alcohol-branded merchandise (ABM) was determined in a sample of rural northern New England adolescents, and the relationship between ownership of such items and initiation of alcohol use was examined.; DESIGN/METHODS: Northern New England middle school students who had not yet initiated alcohol use were captured at baseline in a 1999 school-based survey, and ownership of an ABM item and initiation of alcohol use were determined 1 to 2 years later by telephone. The analysis controlled for demographics (gender, grade in school); characteristics of the child (school performance, sensation seeking, rebelliousness); parenting style; and peer alcohol use.; RESULTS: Of 2406 baseline never-drinkers, 15% had initiated alcohol use and 14% owned an ABM item by follow-up. ABM items consisted primarily of articles of clothing such as t-shirts and hats. ABM ownership was associated with higher grade in school, male gender, exposure to peer drinking, having tried smoking, poorer academic performance, higher levels of sensation seeking and rebelliousness, and less-responsive and restrictive parenting styles. Owners of ABM items at follow-up had higher rates of alcohol initiation compared with non-owners (25.5% vs 13.1%, respectively, p<0.001). After adjusting for the above confounders, students who owned an ABM item were significantly more likely to have initiated alcohol use compared with students who did not own one (adjusted odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0).; CONCLUSIONS: In this northern New England adolescent sample, ownership of alcohol-branded merchandise was prevalent and exhibited an independent cross-sectional association with onset of adolescent drinking. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the relationship is causal, and whether teen use of ABM items influences peer drinking norms and behavior.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the number of food advertisements African American children are exposed to during children's television programming aired on predominantly African American and general television stations.; DESIGN: A content analysis was conducted to identify and analyze the health-related content (HRC) and physical activity-related content (PARC) of food advertisements shown during children's television programming.; SETTING: Three sets of television advertisements from 3 stations (Black Entertainment Television, The WB [Warner Bros], and Disney Channel) served as the sample during a 1-week period in July 2005 (July 11-15), from 3 pm to 9 pm.; RESULTS: In total, 1098 advertisements were recorded, with 256 food and beverage commercials used for this study. Results indicate that 36.3% of all commercials were based on fast food restaurants, 31.3% were for drinks, 16.8% were for candy, 13.7% were for cereals, and 2.0% were for snacks (percentages do not total 100 because of rounding). Compared with The WB and Disney Channel, Black Entertainment Television had significantly (P=.001) more food and beverage advertisements. Few HRC or PARC advertisements were shown. Of 256 food and beverage commercials, only 8.2% contained HRC and 9.4% had PARC. Also, the HRC and PARC scenes contained messages that were implied vs explicitly talking about the health or physical benefits of the product.; CONCLUSIONS: African American children are overexposed to numerous types of food and beverage advertisements. These advertisements do not provide an adequate level of positive HRC and PARC messages. Consequently, the messages that are portrayed may undermine efforts to teach African American children about the importance of healthy living and physical activity.

AB AIM: To compare health behavior patterns of adolescents in Lithuania with health behavior of adolescents in European Union (EU) in 2001/2002.; METHODS: The study was carried out in conformity with the methodology of Health Behavior in School-aged Children: a World Health Organization cross-national study. Three country representative samples of schoolchildren, aged 11, 13, and 15, were surveyed in 25 EU countries and regions in 2001/2002 school year. The study instrument was a standardized questionnaire that included questions on alcohol consumption, smoking, illegal drugs use, physical activity, and other patterns of health behavior. The rate or mean values of the targeted health behavior of Lithuanian students were assessed and compared to those calculated as an average for the EU countries and regions.; RESULTS: We found an early onset of alcohol consumption among Lithuanian boys. Lithuanian boys and girls across all age groups reported being drunk two and more times more often than their peers from other EU member states. Lithuanian 15-year-old boys smoked more often that did their European peers, while girls smoke more rarely. The prevalence of drugs (marihuana group) use among Lithuanian students is relatively low: the prevalence of drug use among 15-year-olds in Lithuania is two times lower than the prevalence in other EU countries and regions (11.2% vs 24.5% for boys and 4.5% vs 18.3% for girls, respectively). Physical activity of Lithuanian adolescents is rather high in comparison with their EU peers, although many students watch television for > or =4 hours a day. Lithuanian students did not eat sweets often, or drank soft drinks (Coca Cola and other), and they ate fruits and had breakfast every school day. With respect to hygienic habits, approximately only one in 3 boys and every second girl brushed their teeth more than once a day.; CONCLUSIONS: There are health behavior differences between adolescents in Lithuania and those in other EU countries. The disparities among health behavior of young people in EU countries and regions require Lithuanian and EU health policy to develop initiatives aimed at decreasing health behavior inequalities.

It claimed that one in three younger people are binge drinkers and that one in six is dependent on alcohol. The comments in interviews with adolescents and families were stark and worrying. Although the age parameters were not clear at the start of the programme, it focused on those aged up to 25 years and presented enormously serious concerns about the changed patterns of drinking among Britain's younger people.

AB This study tests the proposition that peer influence mediates the effect of sensation seeking, a personality trait, on alcohol use among college students. Cross-sectional data to test this proposition were collected from a representative sample of college students at a large public northeastern university (N = 427). Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that, as hypothesized, sensation seeking influenced personal alcohol use both directly and indirectly, through its impact on students' frequency of association with alcohol-using peers and the size of their drinking norm misperception. The findings suggest that interventions that seek to limit the frequency in which high sensation seekers associate with peers whose alcohol use is extreme or, alternatively, seek to facilitate social interactions of high sensation seekers with normative peers, may supplement efforts to influence sensation seekers' alcohol and other drug use through tailored mass media advertisements.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine whether novelty seeking and depressive symptoms had mediated or indirect effects on adolescent smoking progression through tobacco advertising receptivity.; METHODS: More than 1000 adolescents were monitored from 9th grade to 12th grade and completed annual surveys that measured demographic characteristics, smoking behavior, tobacco advertising receptivity, novelty-seeking personality, depressive symptoms, family and peer smoking, alcohol use, and marijuana use.; RESULTS: Latent growth modeling indicated that novelty seeking had a significant indirect effect on smoking progression through baseline tobacco advertising receptivity. For each 1-SD increase in novelty seeking, the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie, being in a specific category or higher), which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade. The indirect effect from depressive symptoms to smoking progression did not reach significance.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings may inform future research on other factors that influence tobacco advertising receptivity, as well as programs aimed at preventing adolescent smoking initiation and progression.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about how physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and various adolescent health risk behaviors are associated. The objective of this study was to examine relationships between PA and sedentary behavior patterns and an array of risk behaviors, including leading causes of adolescent morbidity/mortality.; METHODS: Nationally representative self-reported data were collected (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; wave I: 1994-1995; II: 1996; N = 11957). Previously developed and validated cluster analyses identified 7 homogeneous groups of adolescents sharing PA and sedentary behaviors. Poisson regression predicted the relative risk of health risk behaviors, other weekly activities, and self-esteem across the 7 PA/sedentary behavior clusters controlling for demographics and socioeconomic status. Main outcome measures were adolescent risk behaviors (eg, truancy, cigarette smoking, sexual intercourse, delinquency), other weekly activities (eg, work, academic performance, sleep), self-esteem.; RESULTS: Relative to high television (TV) and video viewers, adolescents in clusters characterized by skating and video gaming, high overall sports and sports participation with parents, using neighborhood recreation center, strict parental control of TV, reporting few activities overall, and being active in school were less likely to participate in a range of risky behaviors, ranging from an adjusted risk ratio (ARR) of 0.42 (outcome: illegal drug use, cluster: strict parental control of TV) to 0.88 (outcome: violence, cluster: sports with parents). Active teens were less likely to have low self-esteem (eg, adolescents engaging in sports with parents, ARR: 0.73) and more likely to have higher grades (eg, active in school, ARR: 1.20).; CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a range of PA-related behaviors, particularly those characterized by high parental sports/exercise involvement, was associated with favorable adolescent risk profiles. Adolescents with high TV/video viewership were less likely to have positive risk behavior outcomes. Enhancing opportunities for PA and sport may have a beneficial effect on leading adolescent risk behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Several environmental factors influence adolescents' food habits and television (TV) viewing is thought to be one of these factors. The purpose of the present study was to describe sociodemographic differences in TV viewing and to examine associations of TV viewing with the consumption of sweets, soft drinks, fruit and vegetables in different countries.; METHODS: Data were collected from 162,305 young people completing the 2001/02 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey, a World Health Organization cross-national study on health and health behaviours among 11-, 13- and 15-year-old school pupils. Analyses of variance were used to examine sociodemographic differences in TV viewing and logistic regression analyses to examine associations between TV viewing and food habits.; RESULTS: Large differences were found between countries in reported daily TV viewing time, from an average of 2.0 h in Switzerland to 3.7 h in Ukraine. The results indicate that those most likely to watch TV are boys, 13-year-olds and pupils of lower socio-economic status. Those who watched more TV were more likely to consume sweets and soft drinks on a daily basis and less likely to consume fruit and vegetables daily, although the latter associations were not so apparent among Central and Eastern European countries.; CONCLUSIONS: Given the high TV viewing rates among adolescents and the association with less healthy food options, many young people are at increased risk of overweight or obesity. Interventions to modify TV viewing behaviour are needed. The findings underscore the importance of tackling socio-economic differences.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate, using an information processing model, how persuasive media messages for alcohol use lead to concurring beliefs and behaviors among youths.; METHODS: Data were collected in 2000-2001 using computer-assisted, self-administered interviews with youths aged 9-17 years (n = 652).; RESULTS: Latent variable structural equations models showed that skepticism was negatively associated with positive affect toward alcohol portrayals and positively with the desire to emulate characters portrayed in alcohol advertisements. These, in turn, predicted expectancies and liking of/desire for beer toys and brands, which predicted alcohol use. Parental guidance decreased alcohol use directly and indirectly by lessening influences of positive affect toward advertising.; CONCLUSIONS: Media alcohol portrayals influence children's drinking through a progressive decision-making process, with its influence underestimated by typical exposure-and-effects analyses.

AB PURPOSE: Alcohol is the most common and frequently used drug and has the potential to cause multiple deleterious effects throughout the lifespan. Because early age at initiation of alcohol use increases this potential and programs and laws are in place to attempt to delay the onset of alcohol use, we studied the relationship between multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and both the likelihood of ever drinking and the age at initiating alcohol use.; METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 8417 adult health maintenance organization (HMO) members in California who completed a survey about ACEs, which included childhood abuse and neglect, growing up with various forms of household dysfunction and alcohol use in adolescence and adulthood. The main outcomes measured were ever drinking and age at initiating alcohol use among ever-drinkers for four age categories: < or = 14 years (early adolescence), 15 to 17 years (mid adolescence), and 18 to 20 years (late adolescence); age > or = 21 years was the referent. The relationship between the total number of adverse childhood experiences (ACE score) and early initiation of alcohol use (< or =14 years) among four birth cohorts dating back to 1900 was also examined.; RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of the cohort reported ever drinking; all individual ACEs except physical neglect increased the risk of ever using alcohol (p < .05). Among ever drinkers, initiating alcohol use by age 14 years was increased two- to threefold by individual ACEs (p < .05). ACEs also accounted for a 20% to 70% increased likelihood of alcohol use initiated during mid adolescence (15-17 years). The total number of ACEs (ACE score) had a very strong graded relationship to initiating alcohol use during early adolescence and a robust but somewhat less strong relationship to initiation during mid adolescence. For each of the four birth cohorts, the ACE score had a strong, graded relationship to initiating alcohol use by age 14 years (p < .05).; CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences are strongly related to ever drinking alcohol and to alcohol initiation in early and mid adolescence, and the ACE score had a graded or "dose-response" relationship to these alcohol use behaviors. The persistent graded relationship between the ACE score and initiation of alcohol use by age 14 for four successive birth cohorts dating back to 1900 suggests that the stressful effects of ACEs transcend secular changes, including the increased availability of alcohol, alcohol advertising, and the recent campaigns and health education programs to prevent alcohol use. These findings strongly suggest that efforts to delay the age of onset of drinking must recognize the contribution of multiple traumatic and stressful events to alcohol-seeking behavior among children and adolescents.

AB AIMS: To consider the effects of alcohol prohibition and police presence upon serious injury in isolated Alaska Native villages.; DESIGN: We compared rates of injury attributed to assault, self-harm, motor vehicle collisions and 'other causes' between villages with or without local prohibition and between villages with or without local police. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the relative effects of prohibition and police presence upon serious injury rates net of potential confounders.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 132 isolated Alaska Native villages between the years 1991 through 2000. MEASUREMENTS; Serious injury was measured using Alaska Trauma Registry and Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics death certificate records. Local option election records were used to classify cases as occurring in wet or dry villages and police deployment records were used to classify cases as occurring in villages with or without local police. Village-level statistics from the 1990 and 2000 US censuses were used in the negative binomial regression analyses.; FINDINGS: Villages that prohibited alcohol had lower age-adjusted rates of serious injury resulting from assault, motor vehicle collisions and 'other causes'. Dry villages with a local police presence had a lower age-adjusted rate of serious injury caused by assault. Controlling for the relative effects of village isolation, access to alcohol markets and local demographic structures, local prohibition was associated with lower rates of assault injuries and 'other causes' injuries while local police presence was associated with lower rates of assault injuries.; CONCLUSIONS: Residents of isolated Alaska Native villages are safer when they prohibit alcohol. A local police presence in dry villages provides further reduction of the incidence of assault.

AB AIMS: Studies have shown that most individuals with alcohol problems have never received any treatment for their alcoholism. The purpose of the present study was to describe demographic and clinical characteristics in male individuals with excessive alcohol intake who were recruited by advertisements. These characteristics were compared between individuals with or without prior treatment histories.; METHODS: Subjects (n = 367) responded to the advertisements in a regional daily newspaper and called the investigators. A structured interview was performed and a complete dataset of demographic and clinical information was collected in 342 individuals.; RESULTS: Individuals with no prior treatment history (n = 238) were found to be more often cohabitant, employed, and they reported fewer on-going psychiatric symptoms than individuals with treatment histories (n = 104).; CONCLUSION: Since individuals with no prior treatment history seldom experience psychiatric symptoms, they are less likely to seek treatment in the health care system. It is therefore of importance to find ways to reach this 'hidden' group early with excessive alcohol consumption. One way to do so might be via alcohol treatment programs at working places since the majority of them are employed.

AB Spain presents one of the lowest suicide rates (8.7 per 100,000) but, as well as Ireland, it has also experienced one of the highest rate increases both within Europe and within the world. In our country, it can be observed an increase in the suicide rates from 1975 to 1994, being this increase greater in men than in women. It can also be noted that there was a stabilisation in the following years. Social factors, specially those which have to deal with gender roles and changes in these roles, are the most common explanations. Another possible explanation for the observed increase in mortality due to suicide among young men could be the AIDS epidemic and intravenous drug addiction, that was observed in Spain during the eighties and nineties. Furthermore, we are witnessing an epidemic related to violence against children and women. Literature strongly suggests that child abuse (psychological and sexual) is associated with increased suicide risk in adolescent or adult life. Women experience violence from their intimate partners and have a greater risk of suffering from chronic pain, diverse somatisations, greater substance use like drugs and alcohol, depression and suicide attempt. The association between work precariousness and suicide seems to be due to economic and social and family support factors, which can lead to greater vulnerability to mental health problems. These factors are of great relevance, since Spain presents one of the highest unemployment and temporary employment rates in the European Union. It seems reasonable that, due to the individualism that characterises the contemporary society, its demands and the new role of women in the work market that cause, among others, a greater difficulty in combining work and family life, are factors that could explain the lack of decrease in suicide rates.

AB CONTEXT: Iran's culture and religion prohibit sexual contact prior to marriage. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, little is known about the sexual activity of unmarried adolescent males or about their knowledge of, and attitudes toward, sexuality and reproductive health.; METHODS: A population-based study of 1,385 males aged 15-18 in Tehran was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were questioned about their beliefs and knowledge regarding reproductive health, and asked whether they had engaged in sexual activity. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with sexual knowledge, attitudes and behavior.; RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of the sample reported having engaged in sexual activity. Sexual experience was associated with older age, access to satellite television, alcohol consumption and permissive attitudes toward sex. Substantial proportions of respondents held misconceptions regarding condoms, STIs and reproductive physiology. Attitudes toward premarital sex were more permissive among respondents who were older, were not in school, had work experience, had access to the Internet or satellite television, lived separately from their parents, or reported having used alcohol, cigarettes or drugs.; CONCLUSION: The relatively high prevalence of sexual activity and the lack of knowledge regarding STIs and contraceptives pose a significant threat to the sexual and reproductive health of adolescent males in Iran. Programs are needed to provide adolescents with the information and skills to make safe sexual decisions.

AB Young adults and young women in particular are drinking more alcohol than ever before, with implications for risky behaviours and long-term health. This study explored the ways in which alcohol and drinking were represented in six monthly UK magazines (three targeted at young men, three at young women) across a three-month period (18 magazines). We identified three main discourses across the texts, namely the drug alcohol; masculinity and machismo; and drinking as normality. These discourses constructed women's and men's drinks and drinking behaviours in sharp contrast. Drinking was aligned with traditional masculine images, although new kinds of drinks were aligned with traditional feminine images--and derided in men's magazines. Findings highlight how gender, constructed in relation to the other, is an important aspect of representations of drinking patterns in young adults.

AB OBJECTIVE: Harmful alcohol consumption is a leading cause of death in the United States. The majority of people who die from alcohol use begin drinking in their youth. In this study, we estimate the impact of interventions to reduce the prevalence of drinking among youth on subsequent drinking patterns and alcohol-attributable mortality.; METHOD: We first estimated the effect of public health interventions to decrease harmful drinking among youth from literature reviews and used life table methods to estimate alcohol-attributable years of life lost by age 80 years among the cohort of approximately 4 million U.S. residents aged 20 in the year 2000. Then, from national survey data on transitions in drinking habits by age, we modeled the impact of interventions on alcohol-attributable mortality.; RESULTS: A tax increase and an advertising ban were the most effective interventions identified. In the absence of intervention, there would be 55,259 alcohol-attributable deaths over the lifetime of the cohort. A tax-based 17% increase in the price of alcohol of dollar 1 per six pack of beer could reduce deaths from harmful drinking by 1,490, equivalent to 31,130 discounted years of potential life saved or 3.3% of current alcohol-attributable mortality. A complete ban on alcohol advertising would reduce deaths from harmful drinking by 7,609 and result in a 16.4% decrease in alcohol-related life-years lost. A partial advertising ban would result in a 4% reduction in alcohol-related life-years lost.; CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to prevent harmful drinking by youth can result in reductions in adult mortality. Among interventions shown to be successful in reducing youthful drinking prevalence, advertising bans appear to have the greatest potential for premature mortality reduction.

AB BACKGROUND: Rapid economic development accompanied by imported Western media, advertising, fashion, and lifestyle in mainland China has resulted in shifts in cultural beliefs and beauty ideals in adolescents. The present study focused on understanding relationships among weight perception and weight-related sociocultural and behavioral factors in Chinese adolescents.; METHODS: Data collected in 2002 from 6863 middle and high school students and their parents from four large cities in mainland China were used. Weight status was determined by measured weight and height. Weight perception, media exposure, attitudes, and health behaviors were assessed by a structured questionnaire survey.; RESULTS: Boys were more likely to describe themselves as either too thin or relatively thin than girls (37.32% vs. 18.79%), while girls more often considered themselves either relatively heavy or too heavy than boys (50.83% vs. 26.54%). Girls who were actually normal or underweight were more likely than boys to describe themselves as either relatively heavy or very heavy (41.6% vs. 11.6%), while boys who were actually normal or overweight were more likely than girls to believe themselves as underweight (30.9% vs. 15.7%). Girls who were frequently exposed to media from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and placed high value on their physical appearance, were more likely to be dissatisfied with their body weight, which in turn were more likely to restrict consumption of certain foods, smoke cigarettes, and drink alcohol. Similar results were not observed in boys.; CONCLUSIONS: Weight dissatisfaction was prevalent in Chinese adolescents and was significantly related to media exposure, attitudes towards physical appearance, and adoption of certain health-risk behaviors in girls. Our findings underscore the importance of sociocultural influences in shaping realistic body image and have implications for prevention and early intervention for establishing health behavioral practices during adolescence.

AB This study tests the impact of an in-school mediated communication campaign based on social marketing principles, in combination with a participatory, community-based media effort, on marijuana, alcohol and tobacco uptake among middle-school students. Eight media treatment and eight control communities throughout the US were randomly assigned to condition. Within both media treatment and media control communities, one school received a research-based prevention curriculum and one school did not, resulting in a crossed, split-plot design. Four waves of longitudinal data were collected over 2 years in each school and were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models to account for clustering effects. Youth in intervention communities (N = 4,216) showed fewer users at final post-test for marijuana [odds ratio (OR) = 0.50, P = 0.019], alcohol (OR = 0.40, P = 0.009) and cigarettes (OR = 0.49, P = 0.039), one-tailed. Growth trajectory results were significant for marijuana (P = 0.040), marginal for alcohol (P = 0.051) and non-significant for cigarettes (P = 0.114). Results suggest that an appropriately designed in-school and community-based media effort can reduce youth substance uptake. Effectiveness does not depend on the presence of an in-school prevention curriculum.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the influence of exposure to US-produced television programs and family rules prohibiting alcohol use on the development of normative beliefs, expectancies, and intentions to drink alcohol in the next 12 months among a group of Norwegian adolescents who reported that they had not previously consumed alcohol. Data were collected via a survey administered to 622 eighth and ninth graders enrolled at ten junior highs in southeastern Norway. To examine these relationships we tested the fit of a structural equation model which was based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1988). Data from the non-drinkers (n= 392, 63% of the respondents) were used. To control for the influence of peer drinking on behavioral intentions, our model was tested under two group conditions: (1) those subjects reporting that they have no friends who drink alcohol and (2) those subjects reporting that they have one or more friends who drink. The findings indicate that the influence of TV exposure was a significant predictor (directly) of normative beliefs, expectancies (indirectly) and intentions to drink (both directly and indirectly) only for those subjects who reported having no friends who drink. For the group with non-drinking friends, family rules constrain intentions only indirectly by influencing normative beliefs. For those with friends who drink, however, family rules have a direct (inverse) effect on intentions. It is concluded that exposure to US-produced television programs functions as a limited knowledge source only for those subjects who had little or no personal experience with alcohol while the presence of family rules have limited impact on behavioral intentions.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine whether adolescents' exposure to youth smoking prevention ads sponsored by tobacco companies promotes intentions to smoke, curiosity about smoking, and positive attitudes toward the tobacco industry.; DESIGN: A randomised controlled experiment compared adolescents' responses to five smoking prevention ads sponsored by a tobacco company (Philip Morris or Lorillard), or to five smoking prevention ads sponsored by a non-profit organisation (the American Legacy Foundation), or to five ads about preventing drunk driving.; SETTING: A large public high school in California's central valley.; SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 9th and 10th graders (n = 832) ages 14-17 years.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceptions of ad effectiveness, intention to smoke, and attitudes toward tobacco companies measured immediately after exposure.; RESULTS: As predicted, adolescents rated Philip Morris and Lorillard ads less favourably than the other youth smoking prevention ads. Adolescents' intention to smoke did not differ as a function of ad exposure. However, exposure to Philip Morris and Lorillard ads engendered more favourable attitudes toward tobacco companies.; CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that industry sponsored anti-smoking ads do more to promote corporate image than to prevent youth smoking. By cultivating public opinion that is more sympathetic toward tobacco companies, the effect of such advertising is likely to be more harmful than helpful to youth.

AB OBJECTIVE: To test whether alcohol advertising expenditures and the degree of exposure to alcohol advertisements affect alcohol consumption by youth.; DESIGN: Longitudinal panel using telephone surveys.; SETTING: Households in 24 US media markets, April 1999 to February 2001.; PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 15 to 26 years were randomly sampled within households and households within media markets. Markets were systematically selected from the top 75 media markets, representing 79% of the US population. The baseline refusal rate was 24%. Sample sizes per wave were 1872, 1173, 787, and 588. Data on alcohol advertising expenditures on television, radio, billboards, and newspapers were collected.; MAIN EXPOSURES: Market alcohol advertising expenditures per capita and self-reported alcohol advertising exposure in the prior month.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the prior month.; RESULTS: Youth who saw more alcohol advertisements on average drank more (each additional advertisement seen increased the number of drinks consumed by 1% [event rate ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.02]). Youth in markets with greater alcohol advertising expenditures drank more (each additional dollar spent per capita raised the number of drinks consumed by 3% [event rate ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.05]). Examining only youth younger than the legal drinking age of 21 years, alcohol advertisement exposure and expenditures still related to drinking. Youth in markets with more alcohol advertisements showed increases in drinking levels into their late 20s, but drinking plateaued in the early 20s for youth in markets with fewer advertisements. Control variables included age, gender, ethnicity, high school or college enrollment, and alcohol sales.; CONCLUSION: Alcohol advertising contributes to increased drinking among youth.

AB OBJECTIVES: Obesity prevention among children and adolescents is a public health priority; however, limited school-based intervention trials targeting obesity have been conducted. This article provides an overview of the study design and baseline preliminary findings of our ongoing school-based intervention study.; DESIGN: Randomized intervention trial to test a school-based, environmental obesity prevention program in urban low socioeconomic status (SES) African-American adolescents. The intervention program was developed based on several behavioral theories and was guided by preliminary findings based on focus group discussion and baseline data.; SETTING: Four Chicago public schools in the US.; SUBJECTS: Over 450 5-7th graders and their families and schools were involved.; RESULTS: Our baseline data indicate a high prevalence of overweight (43% in boys and 41% in girls) and a number of problems in these children's physical activity and eating patterns. Only 26% reported spending > or = 20 min engaged in vigorous-moderate exercise in > or = 5 days over the past 7 days; 29% reported spending > or = 5 h each day watching TV, playing video games, or using computer. They also consumed too many fried foods and soft drinks. On average, 55% consumed fried foods > or = 2 times/day over the past 7 days; regarding soft drinks, 70% reported consuming > or = 2 times/day.; CONCLUSION: School-based obesity prevention programs are urgently needed in the target US urban, low SES, minority communities. These data can be used to inform intervention activities.

AB This article applies the concept of strategic ambiguity in examining viewer responses to brewer-sponsored "responsible drinking" television advertising campaigns. Strategically ambiguous messages are designed to engender diverse interpretations between varied audience segments, and these different selective perceptions should translate into relatively uniform positive corporate images. In this study, teenage and young adult respondents were shown a series of television spots from two leading alcohol companies. As predicted, there was a high degree of diversity in meanings of message content and campaign purpose derived by viewers, particularly among less sophisticated teenagers. Moreover, evaluative ratings of messages and sponsors were generally favorable and more uniform than interpretive responses. The research demonstrates how seemingly prohealth messages can serve to subtly advance both industry sales and public relations interests.

AB Recent health campaigns on college campuses have used a social norms approach, which suggests that one's perceptions of others' attitudes and behaviors are the key components in attitude and behavior change. However, the efficacy of social norms campaigns has been mixed. This study was conducted to assess the relationships among sociodemographics, normative perceptions, and individual attitudes on 3 health behaviors. Students at 2 universities (N = 393) completed questionnaires assessing how these variables related to their consumption of alcohol, tobacco use, and exercise behaviors. Regressions indicated that each of these variables was associated with behavior, but varied independent variables emerged as the salient predictors among behaviors. In several conditions the effect of normative perceptions on behaviors was not significant, a finding in direct opposition to social norms marketing. In all 3 behavioral conditions, the variable accounting for the greatest variance was whether or not the individual liked participating in that particular behavior. Thus, although some social norms marketing may be meeting with success, it may be the case that predicted attitudinal and behavioral changes will not be found when applied across diverse health topics.

AB Many colleges in the United States are employing social norms marketing campaigns with the goal of reducing college students' alcohol use by correcting misperceptions about their peers' alcohol use. Although the typical message used in these campaigns describes the quantity and frequency of alcohol use by the average student on campus, many students may find such a vague comparison to others to be socially irrelevant. This study compares the relative weight of perceptions about alcohol use by distant versus proximate peers in the prediction of college students' personal drinking behavior. The results of analyzing data collected from a sample of college students at a large public northeastern university (N=276) show that, as hypothesized, perceived alcohol use by proximate peers (best friends and friends) was a stronger predictor of students' personal alcohol use than perceived alcohol use by more distant peers (such as students in general), controlling for other strong predictors of alcohol use by college students (age, gender, race, off-campus residency, and sensation-seeking tendencies). The implications of these findings for the design of more effective social norms messages are discussed.

AB College students' processing of alcohol social norms messages, related effects on normative judgments, attitudes toward their own behaviors, and perception of undergraduate attitudes were examined using expectancy violation theories and social norms marketing. Data were collected from 2 universities (N = 393). Following message exposure, the majority moved their normative judgments toward the statistic provided in the message. Slight attitude change occurred but not always in the desired direction. Those most likely to develop unhealthier attitudes drank more than those who developed healthier attitudes, consistent with psychological reactance to the messages. Therefore, the effects of social norms campaigns on those at greatest risk for primary and secondary alcohol effects due to their increased alcohol consumption could lead to increased risk for those participants, indicating that the widespread use of social norms campaigns needs to be scrutinized.

AB This paper highlights pathways for practice and policy to reduce alcohol abuse among adolescents aged 14-17 years. These pathways have been generated following a qualitative study in England that explored adolescents' motivations for binge drinking and the associated outcomes. There are three distinct pathways under consideration. Firstly, the research clearly evidences the close link between binge drinking and an array of risky outcomes, thus supporting policies that tackle generic risk taking (such as Youth Development Programmes). Secondly, given the widely reported positive motivations for binge drinking, adopting a harm-minimisation approach may be more appropriate than promoting abstinence. This harm-minimisation approach can build on strategies reported by adolescents (such as drinking in groups) and consider safer, more supervised venues for adolescent drinking. Thirdly, this study highlights key risk groups, which would arguably be in greater need of harm-minimisation strategies. These were adolescents who drank primarily for the 'buzz', and also those younger age groups (particularly 14 and 15-year-olds) whose drinking was mostly confined to unsupervised, often outdoor locations. This was in contrast to slightly older age groups who, although illegally, were often able to access licensed premises which exerted more control over their drinking. The paper closes by referencing some of the wider policy issues, which must be taken into consideration when attempting to change the culture of binge drinking in England. These include issues surrounding the advertising and marketing of alcohol, the provision of alcohol education in schools and the promotion of alternative, safer activities for adolescents.

AB Alcohol abuse among adolescents is a cause for concern. Around 1995 alcopops (sweetened alcoholic drinks) entered the scene and caused even more concern. Many fear that the sweet taste makes is easier to start drinking for those not yet used to drinking alcohol and the marketing appears aimed at adolescents. Because alcohol use has been linked to television viewing in general and music video viewing in particular this article examined whether a relationship existed between television and music video exposure and the consumption of alcopops. Data were collected with a questionnaire focused on television exposure and alcohol behavior. Respondents were a random sample of 2,546 first- and fourth year schoolchildren of Flanders, the Dutch speaking region of Belgium (60% of the Belgian population). Self reported general TV viewing, music video exposure and drinking of alcopops at home and/or while going out were measured. 68.4% of the respondents watched music videos at least several times a week. The odds of being an alcopop drinker at home increased by 196% for those, who watched music videos at least several times a week (OR = 1.961). For each additional hour of TV viewed per day, the respondents were 17% more likely to be drinkers of altopops at home (OR = 1.169). The odds of being an alcopop drinker, when going out increased by 239% for those who watched music videos at least several times a week (OR = 2.394). For each additional hour of TV viewed per day, the respondents were 19% more likely to be drinkers of alcopops when going out (OR = 1.186). These findings suggest that there is an association between music video exposure and use of alcopops not explained by overall exposure to television. This relationship merits further attention as it is a better predictor of alcopop use, than the control variables and overall TV viewing.

AB This study examines the relative contribution of exposure to entertainment and music magazines on binge drinking among a group of teenagers under the supervision of a juvenile court system in a medium-sized western United States community. Despite having a large proportion of adolescent readers, entertainment and music magazines typically include a substantial number of advertisements for alcoholic beverages in each issue. Data were collected via a self-report questionnaire administered to 342 juvenile offenders (ages 12-18 years). Three-quarters of our respondents reported they have used alcohol and about 37% indicated they were binge drinkers. As anticipated, binge drinkers were more frequent readers of entertainment and music magazines than non-binge drinkers. Binge drinkers also estimated that larger portions of their classmates used alcohol and would be more accepting of regular drinking than non-binge drinkers. Results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict whether our subjects typically consumed five or more drinks during a drinking episode indicated that perceived ease of access, age, gender, the number of best friends who drink, parental drinking (inversely), and entertainment and music magazine reading frequency were significant predictors of binge drinking. We conclude that the predictive influence entertainment and music magazine reading frequency may actually reflect a selectivity bias among a segment of the youth sub-culture already inclined toward alcohol use and abuse. We recommend that entertainment and music magazine reading should be considered only within the constellation of other risk factors when assessing risk for potential alcohol abuse.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the cumulative influence of adverse behavioural, social, and psychosocial circumstances from adolescence to young adulthood in explaining social differences in overweight and obesity at age 30 years and if explanations differ by gender.; DESIGN: A 14-year longitudinal study with 96.4% response rate.; SUBJECT: Data from 547 men and 497 women from a town in north Sweden who were baseline examined at age 16 years and prospectively followed up to age 30 years.; MEASUREMENTS: Overweight and obesity were ascertained at ages 16 and 30 years. Occupation and education were used to measure socioeconomic status. The explanatory measurements were: age at menarche, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, TV viewing, home and school environment, social support, social network, and work environment.; RESULTS: No gender or social difference in overweight was observed at age 16 years. At age 30 years, significantly more men than women (odds ratio (OR) = 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14-3.68) were overweight or obese. Educational level was associated with overweight at age 30 years, but not occupational class. Both men (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.10-2.19) and women (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.16-2.73) with low education (< or =11 years) were at risk of overweight. The factors that explained the educational gradient in overweight among men were low parental support in education during adolescence, and physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and nonparticipation in any association during young adulthood. The educational gradient in overweight in women was explained mostly by adolescence factors, which include early age at menarche, physical inactivity, parental divorce, not being popular in school, and low school control. Restricted financial resource during young adulthood was an additional explanatory factor for women. All these factors were significantly more common among men and women with low education than with high education.; CONCLUSION: Social inequities in overweight reflect the cumulative influence of multiple adverse circumstances experienced from adolescence to young adulthood. Underlying pathways to social inequity in overweight differ between men and women. Policy implications to reduce social inequity in overweight include reduction of social differences in health behaviours and social circumstances that take place at different life stages, particularly psychosocial circumstances during adolescence.

AB This article describes a new biomarker known as the Early Detection of Alcohol Consumption (EDAC) test, which has been steadily penetrating the U.S. market. The EDAC uses routine laboratory tests to make a prediction of heavy drinking in any given person. When tested in mainstream insurance populations, the EDAC has shown twice the specificity of the traditional liver enzyme tests and is significantly more sensitive than the CDT test, which is expected because the EDAC uses a combination of laboratory tests. Maximum diagnostic accuracy is achieved when the CDT test is used to confirm a positive EDAC test. Since brief interventions have proven successful, the early identification of alcohol problems becomes a vital role for physicians. Improved awareness of alcohol misuse can certainly be accomplished through an increased use of biomarkers, with and without concomitant self-report. The ultimate goal is to facilitate early intervention and the successful management of patients diagnosed with heavy drinking.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although early use of alcohol is an immediate and long-term risk for young people, proven prevention strategies are limited. Mass media interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing use of other substances by adolescents. This study tested the impact of a 4-year media campaign designed to reduce alcohol use by early adolescents.; METHOD: Theory-based television and radio messages promoting avoidance of alcohol were developed and delivered to an audience of young people as they matured from Grades 4-5 to Grades 7-8. A set of eight school districts was identified as the Media Area; eight matching districts served as the Comparison Area. Independent Grade 7-8 surveys were conducted in all districts at baseline (N= 2897) and after the interventions (N=2419). Unanticipated community coalitions working to reduce youth substance use were introduced into 10 of these 16 communities during the same time period.; RESULTS: Exposure of the target audience to the media messages was lower than expected, and the unplanned community coalition interventions may have favored the Comparison Area. The main analyses indicated that the media interventions did not significantly affect alcohol use or its mediators. Supplementary analyses suggested a substantial impact of community coalitions on alcohol use and several key mediators.; CONCLUSIONS: The mass media interventions provided by this study had no effect on adolescent alcohol use or its psychosocial mediators. Factors external to the study reduced chances of detecting media effects. Further work is needed to develop and test mass media strategies for alcohol use prevention among early adolescents.

AB Researchers and the lay public have long known of a link between alcohol and aggression. However, whether this link results from alcohol's pharmacological effects or is merely an artifact of the belief that alcohol has been consumed (i.e., placebo effect) has been debated. The current experiments examined the propensity for alcohol-related cues to elicit aggressive thoughts and hostile perceptions in the absence of alcohol or placebo consumption. In Experiment 1, participants made faster lexical decisions concerning aggression-related words following alcohol-related primes compared with neutral primes. In Experiment 2, participants who first were exposed to alcohol advertisements subsequently rated the behavior of a target person as more hostile than participants who initially viewed control advertisements. Furthermore, this effect was largest among participants who most strongly associated alcohol and aggression. Findings are discussed in terms of semantic network theory and links in memory between alcohol and its anticipated effects.

AB INTRODUCTION: The fundamental role of alcohol in the lives of young Australians is mirrored in the level of drinking by adolescents. In 2001, more than one in four Australian adolescents aged 14-19 years consumed alcohol weekly. Teenagers in rural areas are more likely to consume alcohol than their metropolitan counterparts. Parents are key 'gatekeepers' of adolescent behaviour and as such are a salient group to consider in relation to adolescent alcohol use. The aim of this study was to explore parents' attitudes, beliefs, concerns and receptiveness to harm minimisation strategies with respect to teenage use of alcohol.; METHODS: A convenience sample of parents with adolescent children attended a series of focus groups across the north and north-western area of the State of Victoria, Australia. Schools were approached to advertise the project and invite parents to participate. Snowball sampling was used to enhance recruitment.; RESULTS: Parents described patterns of alcohol use such as 'drinking to get drunk' and the influence of both parents and peers on the consumption of alcohol by adolescents. Few parents were concerned about the long-term risks of alcohol use by teenagers; rather they were more concerned about the short-term harms, for example, road trauma and other accidents and risky behaviours such as binge drinking. Parents indicated that they perceived alcohol to be less harmful than other drugs and many indicated that alcohol was often not perceived to be a drug. A number of strategies were adopted by parents to negotiate teenagers' drinking and to minimise the risks associated with alcohol use. These included transporting teenagers to parties, providing teenagers with a mobile phone, setting clear guidelines about alcohol use and/or providing teenagers with a small amount of alcohol. These were seen by parents as strategies for reducing the risks associated with alcohol consumption. Many parents reported that they do not feel well informed about alcohol use and how and when to use harm reduction strategies.; CONCLUSIONS: Rural parents are unsure how to respond to teenagers' alcohol use and drunkenness. While some parental strategies for harm reduction (such as supplying adolescents with a small amount of alcohol) may have good face validity in reducing alcohol consumption among adolescents, these strategies are not supported by previous research findings.

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine associations of television viewing with overall food consumption; METHODS: A computerised 24-hour dietary recall and a questionnaire were completed by 1031 adolescents (+/- 12-14 years of age).; RESULTS: Those who generally watched more television were more likely to consume frequently advertised items such as soft drinks and snacks. Not all frequently advertised food items (e.g. cereals) were associated with television viewing. An inverse association was found with fruit, water and milk. A negative association was found with brown bread; a positive association was found with white bread. The results indicate that high television viewing and a less nutrient dense food pattern are part of a lifestyle influenced by common underlying factors.; CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition interventions aimed at improving adolescents' food habits should target high television-viewers. Our findings underline the importance of tackling socio-demographic differences.

AB The increase in childhood obesity over the past several decades, together with the associated health problems and costs, is raising grave concern among health care professionals, policy experts, children's advocates, and parents. Patricia Anderson and Kristin Butcher document trends in children's obesity and examine the possible underlying causes of the obesity epidemic. They begin by reviewing research on energy intake, energy expenditure, and "energy balance," noting that children who eat more "empty calories" and expend fewer calories through physical activity are more likely to be obese than other children. Next they ask what has changed in children's environment over the past three decades to upset this energy balance equation. In particular, they examine changes in the food market, in the built environment, in schools and child care settings, and in the role of parents-paying attention to the timing of these changes. Among the changes that affect children's energy intake are the increasing availability of energy-dense, high-calorie foods and drinks through schools. Changes in the family, particularly an increase in dual-career or single-parent working families, may also have increased demand for food away from home or pre-prepared foods. A host of factors have also contributed to reductions in energy expenditure. In particular, children today seem less likely to walk to school and to be traveling more in cars than they were during the early 1970s, perhaps because of changes in the built environment. Finally, children spend more time viewing television and using computers. Anderson and Butcher find no one factor that has led to increases in children's obesity. Rather, many complementary changes have simultaneously increased children's energy intake and decreased their energy expenditure. The challenge in formulating policies to address children's obesity is to learn how best to change the environment that affects children's energy balance.

Women's drinking quantity was correlated with parental monitoring, whereas men's drinking frequency was associated with both parental monitoring and television monitoring. Interestingly, men's binge drinking frequency was correlated with television monitoring but not with overall parental monitoring, whereas women's binge drinking frequency was correlated with overall parental monitoring but not with television monitoring. Implications for preventing alcohol misuse and ideas for future research are discussed.

AB This study compared alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverage advertising to which adolescents are exposed. A census of beverage advertising (N = 757) in popular magazines and television during November 1999-April 2000 was analyzed. Most alcohol ads appeared in Sports Illustrated (110), Rolling Stone (98), and Playboy (75) and outnumbered nonalcoholic beverage advertising by 3 to 1. Alcohol was almost never associated with dining. Alcohol ads emphasized sexual and social stereotypes and lacked diversity. One of every 6 magazine alcohol ads, and 1 of every 14 video-based ads, appeared to target teenagers. Many similarities existed between alcohol and nonalcohol ads. We conclude that alcohol is advertised heavily to youth through placement and appeals. The fact that themes in alcohol ads frequently parallel those in nonalcoholic beverage ads may further increase youths' receptivity.

AB AIMS: To describe the frequency of alcohol consumption and beverage preferences in eight countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).; DESIGN: Cross-sectional.; SETTING: Populations of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation and Ukraine.; PARTICIPANTS: Representative samples of the adult population of each country (overall sample size 18,428; response rates: 71-88%).; MEASUREMENTS: A standardised questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers to examine alcohol consumption frequency and usual intakes of beer, wine and strong spirits.; FINDINGS: Between 11 and 34% of males and 26-71% of females reported never drinking alcohol. Abstention was lowest in the Russian Federation and Belarus, two traditional spirits-drinking countries. It was particularly high in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, two countries with a relatively low frequency of alcohol consumption but large amounts consumed per occasion (particularly Georgia). On the contrary, Moldovan respondents drank frequently, but consumed smaller amounts per occasion. As expected, spirits were consumed in largest amounts in traditional spirits-drinking countries, as well as Armenia and wine in traditional wine-drinking countries. Beer consumption was relatively high in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (males), particularly in young respondents.; CONCLUSIONS: Although cross-country comparisons of alcohol intake should be interpreted cautiously, this study suggested that drinking patterns in the countries examined are not entirely typical of usual dry/wet drinking cultures, and confirms that the CIS is very diverse in terms of drinking patterns and beverage preferences. The study provides an important baseline for future comparisons as markets open to new products, as has been the case elsewhere in Europe.

AB OBJECTIVES: To identify perceptions of health, health concerns, and health service needs among young people in a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales.; DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus groups.; SETTING: Berowra, a geographically isolated suburb on the outskirts of Sydney, between December 2002 and April 2003.; PARTICIPANTS: 40 Berowra residents aged 14-24 years, recruited from two local government high schools (two groups), a local youth drop-in centre (one group), and the community, through advertising at the youth centre, local schools and church groups (one group).; RESULTS: Focus group findings were classified into four broad themes. 1: Personal safety is a primary health concern. Berowra needs more recreational facilities to prevent drug and alcohol use related to boredom. 2: Health is more about quality of life than disease and illness. 3: Most health information comes from sources other than health providers. Health education must enable young people to make wise choices for the future. 4: Access to health services is of concern. More education is required on how Medicare works. Young people need to trust their service provider and will only see a doctor if they perceive themselves to be severely ill. Young people value meeting general practitioners in the school and community setting and not just in the doctor's consulting room.; CONCLUSIONS: Young people desire a whole lifestyle approach to health rather than the traditional model based on diagnosis and disease. Health information needs to be accessible anonymously, and healthy lifestyles need to be promoted throughout the whole community, using youth workers and sporting leaders as role models.

AB Numerous studies on the mental health effects of terrorist attacks have been published, with some reporting increases in smoking and drug and alcohol use. None have reported on changes in sexual behavior. To investigate the impact of the September 11 attacks on sexual and drug- and alcohol-using behaviors of men who have sex with men (MSM), an anonymous Internet survey was conducted to obtain information retrospectively on behavior during three month periods before and after the attacks. A total of 2,915 MSM from all 50 U.S. states completed the survey. Men who were exposed to the attacks were not differentially targeted for the survey since the online banner ad used to recruit did not mention September 11. Exposure to the attacks varied: 11.4% lost a friend or relative; 5% witnessed the attacks in person; and nearly all saw the attacks on television within one hour of their occurrence. Nearly equal proportions of men reported increases and decreases in the number of sex partners following September 11. Small, statistically significant increases in unprotected anal intercourse and alcohol use, but not illicit drug use, were found when behavior after September 11 was compared to that before the attacks. Men who lost a friend or relative in the attacks were significantly more likely to report unprotected anal intercourse, an increased number of sex partners, and increased alcohol use after September 11 than those who did not. Counseling about substance abuse and risky sexual behavior should be incorporated into trauma-related programs for adolescents and adults.

AB This study re-evaluated the effectiveness of the anti-drink driving and anti-speeding enforcement and publicity campaigns implemented in the Australian State of Victoria which have thus far yielded mixed results in several evaluations. As opposed to previous evaluations, this study focused on the effects of these campaigns on young male drivers who formed the primary target and examined the combined effects of the campaigns on the total number of serious crashes. Our results showed that the anti-drink driving enforcement and publicity campaigns had a significant independent effect in reducing crashes but their interactive effect was anti-complementary. Conversely, the anti-speeding enforcement and publicity campaigns had no independent effect but their interactive effect was significant in reducing serious crashes involving young male drivers.

AB Very little is known about the differences in breakfast of children performing physical activity in the morning. This paper analyzed the breakfast habits of 747 boys and 455 girls, distributed in 2 homogeneous age groups, 6-10 and 11-14 year-old, participating in a Summer Sport School. Children were asked whether, when, where, how and with whom they consumed breakfast; who prepared meals; what they ate and drank; what they did during breakfast. Weight, height and BMI were recorded. Seventy-eight percent of children usually had breakfast, but 22% reported skipping breakfast. In the non-breakfast consumer subjects, 27.5% were overweight and 9.6% obese vs 9.1 and 4.5% respectively in breakfast eaters. Bakery products (76%) and milk (71%) were the most frequently consumed foods. Only 15% of parents encouraged their children to consume additional foods at breakfast before exercising, and 42% of children believed that this extra nutrition was unnecessary. In 80% of cases, the chief decision-maker for breakfast was the mother, the father played little part (1%). During breakfast, 48% of children ate and drank in silence, 26% played with brothers and sisters, 18% watched television and only 8% talked with parents. A high prevalence of over-weight and obesity was found among non-breakfast consumer children. Breakfast omission in children exercising conflicts with their increased energy requirements and may be connected to the trend of parents and children to under-estimate the importance of breakfast for nutritional balance and for environment promotion of physical performance.

AB OBJECTIVE: To summarize the evidence for the following six strategies to prevent or treat overweight among children: promoting breastfeeding, promoting physical activity, reducing TV/video viewing, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, reducing sugar-sweetened drink consumption, and reducing portion sizes.; METHODS: Summarization of the relevant literature including review articles, relevant newly published work, the Institute of Medicine's Report on Preventing Childhood Obesity and the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity, 2001. This is not a comprehensive review.; RESULTS: Evidence for the association between each strategy and overweight varies. For breastfeeding, physical activity, and TV viewing, there are large review studies. Breastfed children may have a small reduction in risk for overweight. Participation in physical activity may reduce the risk of overweight among school-aged children and adolescents. For preschool- and school-aged children, reducing TV viewing time may reduce their risk of overweight, but most studies report small significant associations. Evidence for an association between each dietary factor and overweight is limited and inconclusive. The biggest gaps in evidence are for the effectiveness of interventions using these strategies. The reviewed interventions based on increasing physical activity (n=7) were effective. Two randomized trials suggest that reducing TV viewing reduces overweight. No intervention studies were found that examined the effectiveness of changing fruit and vegetable consumption, sugar-sweetened drink consumption, or portion sizes. Further clarification of the effect of breastfeeding on obesity is needed.; CONCLUSIONS: These six strategies are reasonable ways to attempt prevention or treatment of overweight in children. Strength of the evidence varies by strategy. The key finding is that more applied research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these and other strategies.

AB This paper investigates the affective responses of youth toward specific elements featured in television alcohol advertisements (i.e., people character, animal character, music, story, and humor). It also examines the associations between advertising likeability and its potential influence. Respondents were 253 children and adolescents in California (47% male; aged 10-17). Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires in group settings. Respondents were shown a stimulus tape containing television advertisements for beer and soft drinks. The tape was stopped at the end of each advertisement to allow respondents to answer questions about that advertisement before viewing the next. Perceived likeability of beer advertisements is a function of the positive affective responses evoked by the specific elements featured in the advertisements. Liking of specific elements featured in beer advertisements significantly contributed to the overall likeability of these advertisements and subsequently to advertising effectiveness indicated by purchase intent of product and brand promoted by these advertisements. Advertisements that focus primarily on product qualities or send a message of legal drinking age were rated less favorably and evoked less desire to purchase the product. Implications for countering the effects of alcohol advertising on young people are discussed.

AB The influence of alcohol advertising on young people continues to be the subject of much debate. This paper presents a review of the literature showing that, while many econometric studies suggest little effect, more focused consumer studies, especially recent ones with sophisticated designs, do show clear links between advertising and behaviour. Furthermore, these effects have to be viewed in combination with the possible impact of other marketing activities such as price promotions, distribution, point of sale activity and new product development. Here, the evidence base is less well developed, but there are indications of effects. It must be acknowledged that categorical statements of cause and effect are always difficult in the social sciences; marketing is a complex phenomenon involving the active participation of consumers as well as marketers and more research is needed on its cumulative impact. Nonetheless, the literature presents an increasingly compelling picture that alcohol marketing is having an effect on young people's drinking.

AB Where alcohol industry self-regulation is the primary protection against youth exposure to alcohol advertising, independent, systematic monitoring of youth exposure can promote public awareness of and greater accountability in the industry's practices. Using commercially available databases, the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth has combined occurrence and audience data to calculate youth (aged 12-20 years) and adult (above the United States legal drinking age of 21 years) exposure to alcohol advertising on television and radio, in magazines and on the Internet. This research in the United States shows that alcohol companies have placed significant amounts of advertising where youth are more likely per capita to be exposed to it than adults. Further analyses by the Center have demonstrated that much of this excess exposure of youth to alcohol advertising in the United States could be eliminated if alcohol companies would adopt a threshold of 15% (roughly the proportion of 12-20-years-old in the population 12 and above) as the maximum youth audience composition for their advertising. Although adoption of such a threshold would still leave much youth exposure to alcohol marketing in such "unmeasured" activities as sponsorships, on-premise promotions and campus marketing, it would assist alcohol companies in reaching their intended audiences more efficiently while reducing overall youth exposure to their advertising.

AB Flavored alcoholic beverages (FABs) were first introduced into the alcohol market in the early I980s in the form of wine coolers. FABs are sweet, relatively low alcohol content beverages that are designed for "entry-level" drinkers. The alcohol industry has introduced new products and production methods to expand the category's popularity. Research suggests that they are popular with underage drinkers, particularly teenage girls, and that the industry uses marketing practices that appear to target youth. FABs are now marketed globally, and their production and marketing vary by country based on national regulatory restraints. In the United States, industry representations that the products are malt beverages for regulatory purposes appears to violate many state laws because the alcohol in the FABs is derived from distilled spirits. Recommendations for regulatory reform, including new legal definitions of FABs, increased taxes, and restrictions on availability, are applicable at both national and state levels.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examined how individual difference vulnerability factors affect college students' perceptions of beer commercial actors' age, attractiveness and drinking. We were also interested in whether viewers' exposure to a cautionary message would affect their perceptions of the actors' drinking behavior.; METHOD: Three groups of college students were exposed to the same set of two alcohol advertisements. After watching the ads, each group received a different cautionary message prior to answering questions about the ad's content: (1) a neutral message (viewed by 42% [n = 119] of the sample), (2) a U.S. federal warning (viewed by 31% [n = 89]) and (3) an industry message (viewed by 27% [n = 76]). We also examined three putative vulnerability factors: age (underage 21 or not), gender and family history of alcohol problems (yes or no) as well as the effects of quantity-frequency of alcohol consumption, episodic heavy drinking, severity of alcohol dependence, disinhibition sensation seeking and the eight factors of the Alcohol Expectancy Scale.; RESULTS: The cautionary messages had no effect on viewers' perceptions of characters' age, attractiveness and drinking behavior. Although neither of the commercials depicted the physical act of drinking, the student raters nevertheless perceived the characters to be heavy episodic drinkers. Those reporting more alcohol dependence symptoms perceived increased drinking for the male characters, as did females and viewers with expectancies for social and physical pleasure.; CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions of the drinking in beer commercials are based in part on the character depicted in the ad and in part on the demographic and personal vulnerability factors of the viewer.

In stratified and multivariable analyses maternal smoking throughout pregnancy and when the child was aged 14 were both associated with the child smoking: fully adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] comparing maternal smoking throughout pregnancy with never smoking was 1.40 [1.25, 1.65] and that comparing maternal smoking when the child was aged 14 with not smoking was 1.57 [1.19, 2.06]. The association of maternal smoking throughout pregnancy was specific for adolescent smoking and was not associated with alcohol consumption, TV viewing or self-report of poor school performance at age 14. Maternal and paternal educational attainment were also associated with smoking at age 14, with these associations attenuating towards the null with adjustment for childhood behavioural problems and cognitive function. There was no association of family income with smoking at age 14 once other explanatory variables were taken into account.

AB AIMS: To examine the extent and content of outdoor food advertisements and food availability from outlets in the vicinity of secondary schools.; METHODS: The sample of schools (n=10) was randomly selected from a sample frame of schools in both an urban and rural region (Wellington and Wairarapa regions respectively) and at each extreme of the socioeconomic status (SES) distribution (based on school characteristics). An area of 1-km radius around the schools was examined for food and non-food product advertisements and shops/outlets.; RESULTS: Out of 1408 outdoor advertisements for products, 61.5% were for food (i.e. 28 per square kilometre). The major categories were soft drinks (21.6%), frozen confectionary (16.2%), savoury snacks (11.4%), and alcohol (8.1%). Overall, 70.2% of food advertisements were for foods classified as 'unhealthy' (i.e. inconsistent with the national nutritional guidelines for adolescents). A majority of the 224 outlets sold food (i.e. 56.3%). Those that primarily sold food were (on average) closer than other outlets to the secondary schools (p=0.03). Out of those schools that sold meals, the proportion of these that advertised a salad option was significantly lower in the low SES neighbourhoods (p=0.006). Other significantly different patterns for food outlet distribution, and category of advertised food were found by SES and rurality.; CONCLUSION: Although only a pilot study, the information obtained suggests that food advertising and food outlets are prevalent in the vicinity of secondary schools and that the advertising is generally not compatible with nutritional guidelines for adolescents. Larger studies into such advertising are needed as well as consideration of policy options to control aspects of the 'obesogenic environment.'

AB To find out the prevalence of good knowledge, appropriate attitude and safe practice among printing workers exposed to organic solvents in Hong Kong, and to see if safe practice was influenced by the knowledge of and the attitude towards the harmful effects of organic solvents as well as other factors. The survey was conducted in a sample of 501 male printing workers from 28 factories in Hong Kong. The knowledge of and attitude towards the harmful effects of organic solvents, as well as the good practices adopted by the workers when handling solvents were explored using a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the major factors that influenced the knowledge, attitude and practice of workers. The prevalence of good knowledge, appropriate attitude and safe practice was low, being 20.4%, 38.4% and 22.0% respectively. Good knowledge was positively associated with awareness of the relevant legislation and past drinking behavior and negatively associated with current smoking. Appropriate attitude depended on having good knowledge and younger age. Safe practice did not depend on knowledge and attitude, but was positively associated with being informed of safety precautions and being supplied with chemical information by supervisors. The majority of workers believed that their employers, the Government and other statutory bodies should be responsible for providing information on chemicals, but very few of them actually obtained information from these sources. More workers preferred publications and talks rather than television as the means of obtaining further knowledge on chemicals. Front line supervisors have a pivotal role to play in improving safe practices of workers by informing them of the necessary precautions and supplying the relevant chemical information.

AB BACKGROUND: Adolescents in the United States are engaging in sexual activity at early ages and with multiple partners. The mass media have been shown to affect a broad range of adolescent health-related attitudes and behaviors including violence, eating disorders, and tobacco and alcohol use. One largely unexplored factor that may contribute to adolescents' sexual activity is their exposure to mass media.; OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine of what is and is not known on a scientific basis of the effects of mass media on adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors. Method. We performed an extensive, systematic review of the relevant biomedical and social science literature and other sources on the sexual content of various mass media, the exposure of adolescents to that media, the effects of that exposure on the adolescents' sexual attitudes and behaviors, and ways to mitigate those effects. Inclusion criteria were: published in 1983-2004, inclusive; published in English; peer-reviewed (for effects) or otherwise authoritative (for content and exposure); and a study population of American adolescents 11 to 19 years old or comparable groups in other postindustrial English-speaking countries. Excluded from the study were populations drawn from college students.; RESULTS: Although television is subject to ongoing tracking of its sexual content, other media are terra incognita. Data regarding adolescent exposure to various media are, for the most part, severely dated. Few studies have examined the effects of mass media on adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors: only 12 of 2522 research-related documents (<1%) involving media and youth addressed effects, 10 of which were peer reviewed. None can serve as the grounding for evidence-based public policy. These studies are limited in their generalizability by their cross-sectional study designs, limited sampling designs, and small sample sizes. In addition, we do not know the long-term effectiveness of various social-cultural, technologic, and media approaches to minimizing that exposure (eg, V-Chips on television, Internet-filtering-software, parental supervision, rating systems) or minimizing the effects of that exposure (eg, media-literacy programs).; CONCLUSIONS: Research needs to include development of well-specified and robust research measures and methodologies; ongoing national surveillance of the sexual content of media and the exposure of various demographic subgroups of adolescents to that content; and longitudinal studies of the effects of that exposure on the sexual decision-making, attitudes, and behaviors of those subgroups. Additional specific research foci involve the success of various types of controls in limiting exposure and the mitigative effects of, for example, parental influence and best-practice media-literacy programs.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine exposure, response to, and awareness of beer advertising in 2 age groups, including awareness of a Budweiser advertisement (ad) that portrayed lizards and an animated ferret.; METHODS: In the spring of 2000, 1,996 fourth graders and 1,525 ninth graders attending 1 of 60 South Dakota schools participated in an in-school survey. Several indicators of advertising awareness, exposure, and response were assessed: recognition, product naming, brand naming, and liking in response to stills drawn from 4 masked television beer ads, listing of beer brands, exposure, attention to, and skepticism toward television beer ads.; RESULTS: Fourteen percent of 4th graders and 20% of 9th graders recognized at least 3 of 4 sample beer ads. Seventy-five percent of 4th graders and 87% of 9th graders recognized the Budweiser ferret ad; about one in three 4th graders could name the brand it advertised, whereas more than three in four 9th graders could do so. When asked to list as many beer brands as they could, almost 29% of 4th graders listed 3 or more beer brands and 82% of 9th graders did so. Ninth graders liked beer advertisements more and paid greater attention to them, but 4th graders were exposed to them more often.; CONCLUSION: Television beer ads result in high levels of beer advertising awareness in children as young as age 9, and even higher awareness among 14-year-olds. Practices that expose or appeal to youth, including use of animated characters, should be avoided by beer advertisers.

AB UNLABELLED: There has been a remarkable increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity in most countries in recent years, which indicates that modern lifestyle is the triggering factor for genetic susceptibility. This report focuses on the two main environmental factors, nutrition and physical activity, that could influence paediatric obesity development, and how health professionals can address these aspects in the management of childhood obesity in a multidisciplinary treatment team. First, the role of a nutrition expert in the multidisciplinary obesity team is discussed and then the importance of physical activity in the treatment of paediatric obesity. The part on nutrition highlights some interesting areas in this field, namely glycaemic index, high-protein diet, fast foods, portion sizes and soft-drink consumption. Dietary treatment in childhood obesity should be combined with changes in physical activity to promote long-term weight loss. Research on the physical activity of children and adolescents indicates some significant changes over the last decades, which are also reviewed. Factors such as sports club participation and television viewing are discussed. The appropriate physical activity level and effective physical activity programmes are also presented. Physical activity can be promoted in childhood obesity treatment in many ways. Practical advice regarding physical activity programme and the role of exercise professionals in childhood obesity treatment team is given.; CONCLUSION: For successful obesity management, the child should be assessed and treated by a multidisciplinary team, including a physician, dietitian, exercise expert, nurse and behavioural therapist.

AB Drinking portrayals and alcohol advertising are common in popular media and young people are highly exposed to them. Although some studies found that exposure to drinking portrayals is related to increases in drinking among youth, other studies produced mixed and inconclusive findings. Similarly, research on the effects of alcohol advertising presents mixed findings. Recent longitudinal research and studies that used modeling techniques that controlled for reciprocal effects suggests that exposure to, attention to, and liking of alcohol advertising may influence children and adolescents' drinking beliefs and behaviors. Further research, and particularly longitudinal studies that address at-risk populations, such as children and minorities, is necessary before firm conclusions about the effects of media portrayals and alcohol advertising can be reached.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recently, the tobacco industry has focused marketing efforts on young adults through bar and club promotions, such as advertising and distribution of free cigarettes in these settings. This study estimates the fraction of the California young adult population that might be exposed and potentially influenced by these efforts.; DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were from 9364 young adult (18-29 years) respondents to the cross sectional population based 2002 California Tobacco Survey. As background, we analysed social smoking (only smoke with other smokers), and enjoyment of smoking while drinking. Our main focus was on bar and club attendance, what was observed in bars and clubs, and how this might differ according to respondents' risk for future smoking.; RESULTS: Social smokers comprised 30.0 (2.2)% of all current smokers, including experimenters. Nearly three quarters (74.5 (2.3)%) of current smokers/experimenters said they enjoyed smoking while drinking. About one third (33.8 (1.2)%) of all young adults said they attended bars and clubs at least sometimes; attendance was significantly higher among smokers and those at risk for future smoking. Close to 60% (57.9 (2.2)%) of bar and club attenders reported seeing cigarette advertising and promotions in these settings. Again, smokers and those at risk were more likely to report seeing such advertising and promotions in these settings.; CONCLUSIONS: About 20% of all young adults and about 30% of those at risk for future smoking (including current smokers) were exposed to tobacco advertising and promotions in bars and clubs. These California results may be conservative, but nonetheless indicate that the group potentially influenced is sizable.

AB AIMS: To examine whether television viewing and music video exposure predict alcohol consumption while going out.; METHODS: Data were collected in two waves (February 2003 and February 2004). Respondents were a random sample of 1648 first and fourth year secondary school children of Flanders, Belgium. Self-reported general TV viewing and music video exposure at time 1 and the quantity of alcohol consumed while going out at time 2 were measured. Controls were gender, age group, smoking behaviour, and alcohol use (at time 1) and pubertal status (at time 2).; RESULTS: Overall television viewing per day and music television viewing at time 1 significantly predicted the amount of alcoholic beverages adolescents consumed while going out at time 2. These results remained significant after controlling for alcohol use at time 1, gender, smoking, and pubertal status.; CONCLUSIONS: TV viewing habits are a significant predictor of alcohol consumption while going out. TV viewing might cause an increase in alcohol consumption or might be an early symptom of developing alcohol habits.

AB Until recently, diabetes in children was virtually synonymous with type 1 diabetes mellitus, whereas type 2 diabetes was a disease of middle age and the elderly. Over the past 10-20 years, an alarming increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been reported from pediatric diabetes centers in North America and elsewhere in the world. Lifestyle factors responsible for the worldwide epidemic of overweight and obesity are responsible for the increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adults and children. This article briefly discusses the diagnosis and major types of diabetes in children but focuses on aspects of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, including demographics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, screening, prevention and treatment. The identification of children at risk for type 2 diabetes and the implementation of community-wide preventive programs will be essential to reverse the tide. The availability of calorie dense "fast foods," candy, and sugared soft drinks must be restricted in schools and other venues frequented by children. Parents must limit the amount of time their children spend watching television and playing computer games. After-school programs that promote physical activity should be a priority of local and central governmental agencies. Prevention will only succeed if governments and local communities recognize that childhood obesity is an important public health problem and provide an environment that promotes changes in lifestyle that prevent and reverse obesity.

AB In Study 1, young drivers (aged between 16 and 29 years, N = 314) rated their driving attributes relative to their peers. They also rated their likelihood of being involved in a crash relative to their peers (crash-risk optimism), their crash history, stereotype of the young driver, and concern over another health issue. A self-enhancement bias was found for all items in which self/other comparisons were made. These items formed two major factors, perceived relative driving ability and perceived relative driving caution. These factors and perceived luck relative to peers in avoiding crashes significantly predicted crash-risk optimism. In Study 2, an experimental group of young drivers (N = 173) watched safety advertisements that showed drinking and dangerous driving resulting in a crash, and a control group (N = 193) watched advertisements showing people choosing not to drive after drinking. Each group then completed the self/other comparisons used in Study 1. The same factors were found, but only driving caution significantly predicted crash-risk optimism. The experimental group showed more self-enhancement on driving ability than the control group. In both studies, men showed substantially more self-enhancement than women about their driving ability. Implications for safety interventions are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: Binge drinking, commonly defined as having more than five drinks on a single occasion, is a public health issue affecting two thirds of Canadian young adults between the ages of 19-24 years. To educate young adults about alcohol poisoning, a network of 16 Ontario Health Units developed and implemented a mass-media campaign. The focus of this article is to report on post-secondary students' perceptions about key media campaign strategies, elements and messages for future campaigns designed to increase awareness about the risks of binge drinking.; METHODS: As part of a multi-method process evaluation, nine focus groups were facilitated to explore the young adults' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about binge drinking and the campaign messages. Participants were also asked to identify specific marketing messages and techniques that would increase their level of awareness about the risks of binge drinking.; RESULTS: Participants recommended that campaigns be targeted towards parents and high school and post-secondary school students. Participants provided recommendations for the types of messages, images, and language they perceived would capture the attention of young adults. Television, posters and the internet were identified as key media channels for disseminating health information about the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption.; CONCLUSION: The problem of binge drinking is pervasive across Canadian campuses and students are largely unaware of the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption. To reach this target population, it is important for future media campaign developers to utilize language, definitions, graphics and channels of communication to which this group relates.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of awareness about five common diseases, namely: Tuberculosis (TB), Typhoid, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS among college female students of Karachi.; METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of female students aged 16-21 years from three colleges selected by convenient sampling method was conducted from January to May 2004. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire.; RESULTS: A large number of students (71%) knew that typhoid spreads by eating contaminated food and drinking infected water. Majority (84%) knew about cough as a mode of spread for TB whereas 69% thought that TB could spread through sneeze of a TB patient. Regarding AIDS, 90% knew that it is sexually transmitted. Majority (87%) knew about the association of hepatitis B and contaminated needles; 64% were aware of hepatitis C and abuse of contaminated needles; 88% knew about the spread of HIV by the use of contaminated needles. A large number (92%) mentioned television as their main source of information.; CONCLUSION: The general level of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS transmission was satisfactory among college girls in this study. The level of awareness of the young educated females about the modes of spread of typhoid, TB, hepatitis B and C is low. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of health education campaign regarding common infectious diseases, especially in young girls.

AB The purposes of this systematic review were to present and compare recent estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in school-aged youth from 34 countries and to examine associations between overweight and selected dietary and physical activity patterns. Data consisted of a cross-sectional survey of 137 593 youth (10-16 years) from the 34 (primarily European) participating countries of the 2001-2002 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Study. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was determined based on self-reported height and weight and the international child body mass index standards. Logistic regression was employed to examine associations between overweight status with selected dietary and physical activity patterns. The two countries with the highest prevalence of overweight (pre-obese + obese) and obese youth were Malta (25.4% and 7.9%) and the United States (25.1% and 6.8%) while the two countries with the lowest prevalence were Lithuania (5.1% and 0.4%) and Latvia (5.9% and 0.5%). Overweight and obesity prevalence was particularly high in countries located in North America, Great Britain, and south-western Europe. Within most countries physical activity levels were lower and television viewing times were higher in overweight compared to normal weight youth. In 91% of the countries examined, the frequency of sweets intake was lower in overweight than normal weight youth. Overweight status was not associated with the intake of fruits, vegetables, and soft drinks or time spent on the computer. In conclusion, the adolescent obesity epidemic is a global issue. Increasing physical activity participation and decreasing television viewing should be the focus of strategies aimed at preventing and treating overweight and obesity in youth.

AB ISSUE ADDRESSED: To assess whether the strategies used to sell the 'ready-to-drink' (RTD) category of alcoholic beverages is contributing to alcohol-related harm among adolescents.; METHODS: An initial investigation of bottleshops, which included an observational study designed to analyse methods employed by the liquor industry to market RTDs in bottleshops, on the central coast of New South Wales. We measured the number of glass-door display refrigerators to determine refrigerated space allocated to display RTDs compared with other alcoholic products. This measure was used to establish a quantitative baseline as an indicator for the in-store marketing of these products. We then randomly selected a dozen bottleshops from those previously visited and conducted semi-structured interviews with the staff.; RESULTS: The display of colourful, youth-oriented products and packaging in glass-door display refrigerators appears to be the primary in-store method for marketing RTD products. More than 40% of all glass-door display refrigerators in bottleshops on the central coast are dedicated to the storage and display of RTDs. More than half of the staff interviewed at bottleshops reported they believed that RTD products were marketed to under 18s, particularly girls.; CONCLUSION: There is already a high level of consumption of RTDs by under 18s. There is very strong marketing of these products by the liquor industry. This trend will further compound the already high-risk level of consumption of these products by young people.

In this review, we discuss key concepts of nutrition and physical activity. Etiology, prevention, and treatment strategies are also discussed, focusing on the macronutrient content of the diet, portion control, meal patterns, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors. Television viewing, lack of physical activity, and intake of fast food and soft drinks are also examined as potential contributing factors in the obesity epidemic. Children should be helped to develop healthy nutrition and exercise habits early, since interventions are most effective when behaviors are still being formed.

AB We measured lead and mercury in samples collected from 31 homes in communities near the former Clark Air Base, Philippines during May and October 2002. Sample media included water used for drinking and cooking, house dust and entryway soil. Composite samples of 15 food items purchased at local markets were also collected. Samples were analyzed for total lead (Pb) and total mercury (Hg) to evaluate the relative importance of each media to residential exposure concentrations in the community adjacent to Clark (Community A) versus a control community 5 km away (Community B). In general, we measured low (e.g. background) to undetectable levels of the target analytes in all media sampled with two important exceptions. First, the Hg concentrations we measured in canned mackerel composites, which were within the range reported for mackerel from other locations worldwide, may pose a risk to pregnant women who are frequent consumers (e.g. one or more cans per day). Second, we measured Pb above the USEPA residential screening concentration (400 mug/g) in dust and soil from two homes, illustrating the need for periodic residential lead monitoring in these and other communities in the Philippines. We found no significant difference between Communities A and B with respect to Pb and Hg concentrations in water or food, although we were not able to detect very low levels of Pb in most of the foods we sampled because of trace Pb contamination added during sample homogenization. Although the Pb levels we measured in dust and soil from Community A homes were higher on average than Community B homes, the levels in both communities were low (e.g. background) thus we did not investigate the difference further. To our knowledge, these are the first reported measurements of Pb in house dust in the Philippines. The concentrations of Pb we measured in house dust were significantly higher than those in entryway soil from both communities, adding empirical support to the assertion that yard soil should not be considered a proxy for house dust in exposure studies in the Philippines or elsewhere.

AB AIMS: Previous research has shown that heavier drinkers, in comparison to light drinkers or abstainers, are more likely to favour increased access to alcohol and relaxation of control policies. Often, studies have not examined whether attitudes to alcohol policies vary according to a respondent's pattern of drinking. This study examined the association between drinking variables and views on policy, using six drinking variables and six topics on alcohol policy.; METHODS: Data were available from two Ontario surveys conducted in 2000 and 2002, which took representative samples of adults, aged 18 and older, selected by random digit dialling, who participated in interviews over the telephone (n = 1294 and 1206, respectively). Drinking variables include drinking status, drinking frequency, usual number of drinks, typical weekly volume, frequency of 5+ drinks per occasion and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores. Six policy items were examined: alcohol taxes, warning labels, density of retail alcohol outlets, privatization of government liquor stores, alcohol advertising and consultation with health experts on decisions on alcohol policy. Logistic regression analyses included five demographic variables: gender, age, marital status, education and income.; RESULTS: Among males, there was strong support for increased access to alcohol and fewer controls over alcohol policies. This relationship, although not as strong, also emerged for frequent consumers, high volume drinkers and those with a higher AUDIT score.; CONCLUSION: Whether it is intentional or not, government policies that tend to make alcohol more available cater to young, heavy-drinking males who possibly experience problems in connection with their drinking behaviour.

AB AIMS: To examine the relationship between exposure to different forms of alcohol advertising and subsequent drinking among US adolescents and assess whether exposure to an alcohol and drug prevention program mitigates any such relationship.; DESIGN: Regression models with multiple control variables examined the relationship between exposure to alcohol advertising in grade 8 and grade 9 drinking for two groups of South Dakotan adolescents: (1) seventh-grade non-drinkers (n = 1206) and (2) seventh-grade drinkers (n = 1905). Interactions between the intervention program and the significant advertising predictors were tested.; SETTING: Forty-one middle schools in South Dakota, USA.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3111 seventh-graders followed through grade 9.; MEASUREMENTS: Advertising variables were constructed for four types of alcohol advertising-television, in-store displays, magazines and concession stands. Other predictors tested included measures tapping social influences, social bonds, problem behavior, alcohol beliefs, television exposure and demographics.; FINDINGS: For seventh-grade non-drinkers, exposure to in-store beer displays predicted drinking onset by grade 9; for seventh-grade drinkers, exposure to magazines with alcohol advertisements and to beer concession stands at sports or music events predicted frequency of grade 9 drinking. Although exposure to television beer advertising had a significant bivariate relationship with alcohol use for grade 7 non-drinkers, it was not a significant predictor of drinking for either group in multivariate analyses. Participation in the prevention program, ALERT Plus, reduced future drinking for both groups and counteracted the effect of in-store beer displays.; CONCLUSIONS: Several forms of alcohol advertising predict adolescent drinking; which sources dominate depends on the child's prior experience with alcohol. Alcohol prevention programs and policies should help children counter alcohol advertising from multiple sources and limit exposure to these sources.

AB Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83.4% of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

AB Public Service Announcements tailored to specific college drinking rituals (Treise, Wolburg and Otnes 1999) were tested on 133 underage undergraduate drinkers. More significant reductions in drinking intentions were found when using appeals focusing on drinking rituals pertaining to Maturity/Order (older students drink moderately: "Don't drink like a freshman.") than to Transformation (desired personality and mood changes), Community (social bonding and camaraderie), or a no-message Control. Gender did not moderate this effect. Underage drinkers may drink, in part, to feel more "grown up." Emphasizing that more senior students actually drink responsibly may diminish this belief and result in reduced alcohol consumption among underage students.

AB The forced opening of Taiwan's tobacco market in 1987 has changed the smoking environment. This study analyzes the effects this market opening had on Taiwan's secular smoking rates over 15 years. The data sources used were consumer surveys conducted by the Taiwan Tobacco & Wine Monopoly Bureau 1964-1996, the 2001 National Health Interview Survey, and a series of annual per capita gross national product (GNP) data reported by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting & Statistics. After Taiwan's tobacco market was forced open in 1987 by the U.S. government in trade negotiations, smoking rates rose (7%-10% for males and 39%-75% for females) for the first three years. After the initial 3-year surge, smoking rates gradually declined to 1986 baseline rates or even lower for all groups except females aged 30 and younger, who have shown a small but steady increase in cigarette consumption. Results of multiple regression analysis showed per capita GNP and age to be the two major factors affecting smoking rate change after the Taiwan market opening. National tobacco control policies and campaigns seem to have an impact on tempering the effect of foreign tobacco imports in all groups, except young females, whose rise in smoking rate is significant and alarming.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of screening for sexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses and to study the profile of sexual activity and other risk behaviours in a senior high school population.; METHODS: In this descriptive study we provided sexual health education and screening to students from two senior high schools in the Australian Capital Territory. We collected behavioural data using a self-administered questionnaire. Urines and swabs were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), Neisseria gonorrhoea (Ng), Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv) and human papilloma virus (HPV). Blood specimens were tested for hepatitis B and C, HIV, herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and syphilis.; RESULTS: A total of 795 students participated (31% of the enrolled population; female to male ratio 60:40) and 67.0% were sexually active. Of 795 students, 644 (81.0%) were screened. Rates of infection were Ct 1.1% (95% CI: 0.4-2.6), HPV 11.7% (95% CI: 7.4-17.3), HSV-1 32.5% (95% CI: 28.9-36.3), HSV-2 2.4% (95% CI: 1.3-3.9), hepatitis B surface antigen 0.3% (95% CI: 0.04-1.1) and hepatitis C antibodies 0.7% (95% CI: 0.07-1.6). Only 22.3% (95% CI: 19.3-25.7) of students had immunity to hepatitis B. There were no cases of HIV, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis or syphilis. Of the sexually active students, 49.2% (95% CI: 38.9-59.2%) reported never or only sometimes using condoms, 41.5% (95% CI: 32.2-52.3%) reported unsafe drinking, 33.3% (95% CI: 23.9-43.1%) were smokers and 1.9% (95% CI: 0.2-7.0%) reported injecting drug use.; CONCLUSIONS: Rates of STI and blood-borne viruses and immunity to hepatitis B were low in this population, but unsafe sex and other risk behaviours were common. We have demonstrated that STI screening, including serological testing, was well accepted in a senior high school population.

AB BACKGROUND: Portrayals of the use of over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics on television may stimulate their use.; OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between taking OTC analgesics and television viewing by adolescents.; METHODS: A standardized self-administered questionnaire among first-year (mean age 13.16 y) and fourth-year (mean age 16.37 y) secondary students in Flanders, Belgium (n = 2546) was administered in a school setting. The independent variable was television viewing; control variables were school year, gender, drinking alcohol, days off sick, computer gaming, and Internet use. The main outcome variable was monthly use of OTC analgesics.; RESULTS: On average, respondents watched 3 hours 18 minutes of television per day (boys more than girls, first-year students more than fourth-year students). Per additional hour of television per day, the odds that respondents were regular users of analgesics were 1.16 times higher (95% CI 1.08 to 1.24). For the 10% heaviest viewers, the odds were 2.30 times higher (95% CI 1.25 to 4.24) compared with the 10% lightest viewers. Odds of OTC analgesic use were higher for students reporting more sick days in the past year (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.49), regular users of alcohol (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.50), and girls (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.73).; CONCLUSIONS: A relationship was found between watching television and the use of OTC analgesics, even after controlling for gender and lifestyle measures. More research is needed to establish whether this relationship is causal.

Two thirds of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students reported at least weekly visits to small grocery, convenience, or liquor stores. Such visits were associated with a 50% increase in the odds of ever smoking, even after control for social influences to smoke. Youth smoking rates may benefit from efforts to reduce adolescents' exposure to tobacco marketing in stores.

AB Smokers who are exposed to cues associated with smoking show cardiovascular reactivity and an increase in smoking urges as compared to when they are presented with neutral cues. Cue exposure therapy (CET), which refers to the repeated exposure to drug-related cues in order to extinguish this learned association, has increasingly been proposed as a potential treatment of addictive behaviors, including tobacco smoking. The result of our pilot study suggests that a cue elicited using a virtual environment (VE) is more effective than other cue exposure devices. The VE was composed of craving environments (virtual bar) and objects (an alcoholic drink, a packet of cigarettes, a lighter, an ashtray, a glass of beer, and advertising posters) that are likely to trigger craving, a smoking avatar, and an audio environment that included the noisy sound and music of a restaurant. Sixteen late-adolescent males who smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day were recruited to participate in the VE-CET study. The CET virtual bar program consisted of six sessions, and the participants were exposed repeatedly to each session using different questions and procedures. Although the effects of CET did not yield significant reductions in all of the dependent variables, the craving for cigarettes was gradually decreased during the course of the sessions. This tendency was closely related to the reduction in the smoking count between the morning before the experiment and the start of the experiment. Based on these preliminary results, it appears that VE-CET maybe a useful tool to use in treatment programs to help reduce craving in those who are nicotine dependent.

It was conducted during December 15, 2001 and February 15, 2002. Data were collected using interview questionnaires. The logistic regression was used to control possible confounding factors. The subjects consisted of 186 cases who had consumed energy drinks for more than 3 months and 186 controls who had given up for more than 3 months. They were frequency/group matched by age group. There was statistically significant association among energy drinks consumption and overtime work, motivation from advertisements, positive attitude of energy drinks consumption, alcohol drinks, smoking and ex-taking Kratom behavior. Multivariate analyses revealed that only 5 factors were related to energy drinks consumption: marital status (OR = 1.88, 95%CI: 1.14, 3.11), overtime work (OR = 2.84, 95%CI: 1.73, 4.64), motivation from advertisements (OR = 2.72, 95%CI: 1.67, 4.42), positive attitude of energy drinks consumption (OR = 4.06, 95%CI: 1.65, 10.01) and ex-taking Kratom behavior (OR = 2.77, 95%CI: 1.19, 6.44). As a result, construction workers should be provided with the knowledge of energy drinks consumption, the effect of drug dependence behavior, and the advantages of safe and healthy food that is cheap, readily available, and rich in nutrients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review how tobacco transnational companies conducted their business in the hostile environment of Singapore, attempting to counter some of the government's tobacco control measures; to compare the Malaysian and the Singaporean governments' stance on tobacco control and the direct bearing of this on the way the tobacco companies conduct their business.; METHODS: Systematic keyword and opportunistic website searches of formerly private internal industry documents.; RESULTS: The comprehensive prohibition on advertising did not prevent the companies from advertising cigarettes to Singaporeans. Both British American Tobacco and Philip Morris used Malaysian television to advertise into Singapore. To launch a new brand of cigarettes, Alpine, Philip Morris used a non-tobacco product, the Alpine wine cooler. Other creative strategies such as innovative packaging and display units at retailers were explored to overcome the restrictions. Philip Morris experimented with developing a prototype cigarette using aroma and sweetened tipping paper to target the young and health conscious. The industry sought to weaken the strong pack warnings. The industry distributed anti-smoking posters for youth to retailers but privately salivated over their market potential.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intervention strategies are available for reducing the high global burden of hazardous alcohol use as a risk factor for disease, but little is known about their potential costs and effects at a population level. This study set out to estimate these costs and effects.; METHOD: Analyses were carried out for 12 epidemiological World Health Organization subregions of the world. A population model was used to estimate the impact of evidence-based personal and nonpersonal interventions--including brief physician advice, taxation, roadside random breath testing, restricted sales access and advertising bans. Costs were measured in international dollars (I$); population-level intervention effects were gauged in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) were computed.; RESULTS: The most costly interventions to implement are brief advice in primary care and roadside breath testing of drivers. In populations with a high prevalence of heavy drinkers (more than 5%, such as Europe and North America), the most effective and cost-effective intervention was taxation (more than 500 DALYs averted per 1 million population; CER < I$500 per DALY averted). In populations with a lower prevalence of heavy drinking, however, taxation is estimated to be less cost effective overall than other, more targeted strategies, such as brief physician advice, roadside breath testing and advertising bans.; CONCLUSIONS: The most efficient public health response to the burden of alcohol use depends on the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use, which is related to overall per capita consumption. Population-wide measures, such as taxation, are expected to represent the most cost-effective response in populations with moderate or high levels of drinking, whereas more targeted strategies are indicated in populations with lower rates of hazardous alcohol use.

AB The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children is increasing rapidly. This is alarming because obesity is associated with severe chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Obesity at young age is related to obesity at adult age. Consequently, the prevention of overweight from childhood onwards is an important issue. Apart from diabetes mellitus type 2 there is an increased risk of orthopaedic complications, respiratory problems, fertility problems, cardiovascular diseases and psychosocial consequences in the form of a negative self-image, emotional and behavioural problems and depression. Environmental and behavioural factors are regarded as the most important causes of the rapid increase in the prevalence of overweight and as the most important starting points for prevention. Most prevention programmes are still in the initial stages. Prevention programmes aimed at stimulating breast feeding and daily physical activity (playing outside) and the restriction of sweetened drinks and watching TV are very promising. With such preventive measures the involvement of both the school and the parents is important.

Public health has historically relied on a series of targeted regulations, taxes, and education efforts to curb epidemics, and will rely on similar strategies to combat obesity. We argue that interventions targeted at youth are relatively easy to justify on economic grounds due to the additional protections that this group requires, but that justification for government interventions aimed at curbing obesity among adults requires additional evidence that private markets are not functioning properly. We then present seven proposed intervention strategies to promote healthy eating, and use an economic framework to discuss the relative merits of the interventions. This evaluation will allow policymakers to make more informed decisions concerning the relative merits of these strategies in combating the obesity epidemic.

AB The present study examines the energy intake resulting from eating snacks and drinking energy containing drinks while watching television. 2546 first and fourth year students in a random sample of 15 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium received quantifiable, closed survey questions about average weekly TV viewing volume and about eating five types of snacks and drinking two types of soft drinks. On an average, the respondents watched 22:27 h of television per week (SD = 11:53). Only 3.5% of the adolescents never eat snacks or drink soft drinks while they watch TV. Estimated daily energy intake accompanying TV viewing amounts to 19% of the Belgian average energy allowance (AEA) in boys and between 12 and 14% of AEA in girls. On an average 1 h of watching television equals the consumption of 653 kJ.

AB Carbonated beverages have been reported to increase fracture risk in children but the mechanism is unclear. The aim of this population-based case-control study was to investigate the association between soft drink and milk consumption, physical activity, bone mass, and upper limb fractures in children aged 9-16 years. A total of 206 fracture cases and 206 randomly selected individually matched controls were studied. There were 47 hand fractures; 128 wrist and forearm fractures, and 31 upper arm fractures. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilized to retrospectively assess last-year physical activity (including television, computer, and video watching) and to recall the average weekly consumption of milk, colas, and total carbonated drinks. Bone mass at the spine, hip, and total body was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and metacarpal morphometry. For total fractures, none of the above drink types was significantly different between cases and controls. For wrist and forearm fractures, there was a positive association between cola drink consumption and fracture risk (OR 1.39/unit, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.91). Cola consumption was significantly correlated with television, computer, and video watching (r = 0.20, P = 0.001) but not bone mineral density or milk drinks. After adjustment for television, computer, and video watching and bone mineral density, the association between cola drinks and fracture risk became nonsignificant (OR 1.31/unit, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.83). No association with other fracture sites was observed. In conclusion, cola, but not total carbonated beverage consumption, is associated with increased wrist and forearm fracture risk in children. However, this association is not independent of other factors and appears to be mediated by television watching and bone mineral density but not by decreased milk intake.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widespread mycotoxin which contaminates food such as cereals, beer, coffee, wine and products of animal origin. OTA is known for its nephrotoxic, immunotoxic and carcinogenic properties. The prevalence of OTA in human blood and foodstuffs has been investigated in many countries. In this study, exposure of the Lebanese population to OTA was evaluated and the contamination of the most commonly consumed foods in Lebanon by OTA was assessed. Plasma samples from healthy individuals and also cereals and beer samples obtained from markets were collected from the different regions of Lebanon. OTA was detectable in 33% of tested plasma samples (n =250) with a concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.87 ng/mL and a mean of 0.17+/-0.01ng/mL. No sex and age differences were found. The frequency of OTA-positive plasma samples obtained in the South of Lebanon and in the Bekaa valley (50 and 47%, respectively) was significantly higher compared to plasma samples obtained in the Beirut/Mount Lebanon region (19%). Food analyses showed that wheat, burghul and beer were contaminated with a mean value of 0.15+/-0.03 microg/kg, 0.21+/-0.04 microg/kg and 0.19+/-0.12 ng/mL, respectively. These data suggest that the Lebanese population is exposed to OTA through food ingestion at concentrations lower than the tolerable daily intake.

AB EDITOR'S NOTE: The problem of childhood obesity is accelerating throughout the world. The following is a position paper from The European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG) that outlines the nature of the problem of childhood obesity along with treatment and prevention methods available today. The paucity of literature on prevention and treatment of obesity in children as documented in this paper points out the need for much additional research on obesity in children.; OBJECTIVES: The awareness of childhood obesity as a major health problem and an uncontrolled worldwide epidemic has to be increased in the society.; DESIGN: In order to improve the quality of the health care and to minimize the cost it is important to investigate and standardize pediatric obesity prevention and treatment and to adapt to social and cultural aspects.; RESULTS: Obesity is the result of excess body fat. The different norms and definitions in Europe and the US is described and clarified. However, the available methods for the direct measurement of body fat are not easily used in daily practice. For this reason, obesity is often assessed by means of indirect estimates of body fat, that is, anthropometrics. There are essentially six relevant levels, which could be involved in prevention of child and adolescent obesity: family (child, parents, siblings, etc), schools, health professionals, government, industry and media. Evidence-based health promotion programs has to be given a high priority. Government should encourage media increase information about healthy nutrition and to avoid the marketing of unhealthy foods including sweet drinks, for example, in TV. Many different approaches of treatments of obesity have been investigated, including diet, exercise, behavioral therapy, surgery, and medication. None have been found to be effective enough as sole tools in children. This has led to focus on multidisciplinary programs especially involving families. Behavioral cognitive therapy is effective in treating childhood obesity as is family therapy. Surgery and drug treatment cannot be recommended without additional research. Clinicians should consider the various factors that can influence body composition.; CONCLUSION: It is important to know and to follow nutritional factors, energy intake and composition of the diet, nutrition and hormonal status, food preferences and behavior, and the influence of non-nutritional factors. We recommend that obesity should be the major priority both in the health care system, on the scientific level and for future political actions.

AB The percentage of US adolescents who are overweight or at-risk of overweight has increased over the past 20 years. Using data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988-1994, multivariate regression models of body mass index (BMI) for adolescent males and females aged 12-16 years were developed to examine the relative importance of demographics, beverage consumption, physical activity, and sedentary behavior for maintaining a healthy body weight. The models explained between 11% and 19% of the variance in BMI. Demographic characteristics accounted for roughly one-half of the explained variance in the models. Age was positively associated with BMI for males and females. Family income had a negative association with BMI for females, but no association with BMI for males. The variables for race/ethnicity and region were only occasionally statistically significant. A strong negative association was found between BMI and participation in team sports or exercise programs for both males and females. The estimate of the relationship between television viewing and BMI was positive but not statistically significant. Consumption of regular carbonated soft drinks (RCSD) and fruit drinks/ades--two beverages widely hypothesized to be positively associated with BMI--were not statistically significant in any of the models. Consumption of diet carbonated soft drinks was very low and was positively associated with BMI for females but not for males. The potential impacts of increasing participation in teams or exercise programs, reducing television viewing, and reducing RCSD consumption on BMI were examined. Increasing participation in teams or exercise programs consistently had the largest impact on reducing predicted BMI. The impact of reducing television viewing had the next largest impact. Reducing consumption of RCSD had the smallest impact. Policies that revitalize physical activity and physical education programs for all students--not just student athletes--and educational efforts that discourage sedentary behavior will be far more successful in combating overweight than an undue focus on beverage consumption.

AB AIMS: The helper therapy principle suggests that, within mutual-help groups, those who help others help themselves. The current study examines whether clients in treatment for alcohol and drug problems benefit from helping others, and how helping relates to 12-step involvement.; DESIGN: Longitudinal treatment outcome.; PARTICIPANTS: An ethnically diverse community sample of 279 alcohol- and/or drug-dependent individuals (162 males, 117 females) was recruited through advertisement and treatment referral from Northern California Bay Area communities.; PARTICIPANTS: were treated at one of four day-treatment programs.; MEASUREMENTS: A helping checklist measured the amount of time participants spent, during treatment, helping others by sharing experiences, explaining how to get help and giving advice on housing and employment. Measures of 12-step involvement and substance use outcomes were administered at baseline and a 6 month follow-up.; FINDINGS: Helping and 12-step involvement emerged as important and related predictors of treatment outcomes. In the general sample, total abstinence at follow-up was strongly and positively predicted by 12-step involvement at follow-up, but not by helping during treatment; still, helping positively predicted subsequent 12-step involvement. Among individuals still drinking at follow-up, helping during treatment predicted a lower probability of binge drinking, whereas effects for 12-step involvement proved inconsistent.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the helper therapy principle and clarify the process of 12-step affiliation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with nonalcoholic carbonated beverage (soft drink) consumption in children.; DESIGN: Mail-in surveys collected by Dragonfly, a children's educational magazine distributed nationally to elementary and middle schools, were analyzed. The survey included questions about frequency of soft drink consumption and factors related to soft drink consumption.; SUBJECTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 560 children, 8 to 13 years old, who completed and mailed in the survey. There was an equal distribution of boys and girls (51% and 49%, respectively).; STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Frequency distributions were calculated and chi(2) tests were conducted to determine whether soft drink consumption and related factors varied by sex and age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of soft drink consumption with each factor after adjustment for potential confounders.; RESULTS: Preference for the taste of soft drinks was the strongest predictor in the analysis, with those who reported the strongest taste preference 4.50 times more likely (95% confidence interval=2.89-7.04) to consume soft drinks five or more times per week than those with a lower taste preference. Youth whose parents regularly drank soft drinks were 2.88 times more likely (95% confidence interval=1.76-4.72) to consume soft drinks five or more times per week compared with those whose parents did not regularly drink soft drinks.; CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that several factors may be associated with soft drink intake in school-aged children, most notably taste preferences, soft drink consumption habits of parents and friends, soft drink availability in the home and school, and television viewing. Additional research is needed to verify these findings in a representative sample of children.

AB This study addresses binge drinking in college as a risk factor for heavy drinking and alcohol dependence after college. A national probability sample of 1972 college students from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY79) was interviewed in 1984 and reinterviewed again as adults in 1994. The short-term effects of binge drinking in college were assessed as well as the extent to which experiences of negative effects in college predicted patterns of alcohol use across the transition from college into postcollege years. As expected, college binge drinkers were comparatively more likely than nonbinge drinkers to experience one or more alcohol-related problems while in college. In addition, weighted estimates of DSM-IV-defined diagnostic criteria in logistic regression models indicated that the binge drinking patterns exhibited during the college years, for some former college students of both genders, posed significant risk factors for alcohol dependence and abuse 10 years after the initial interview, in conjunction with evidence of academic attrition, early departure from college and less favorable labor market outcomes.

AB AIMS: To examine the relationship between alcohol outlet density and violent crime controlling for neighbourhood sociostructural characteristics and the effects of spatially autocorrelated error.; DESIGN: The sample for this ecologic study comprised 188 census tracts from the City of Austin, Texas and 263 tracts from the City of San Antonio, Texas. Data pertaining to neighbourhood social structure, alcohol density and violent crime were collected from archival sources, and analysed using bivariate, multivariate and geospatial analyses.; RESULTS: Using ordinary least squares analysis, the neighbourhood sociostructural covariates explained close to 59% of the variability in violent crime rates in Austin and close to 39% in San Antonio. Adding alcohol outlet density in the target and adjacent census tracts improved the explanatory power of both models. Alcohol outlet density in the target census tract remained a significant predictor of violent crime rates in both cities when the effects of autocorrelated error were controlled for. In Austin, the effects of alcohol outlet density in the adjacent census tracts also remained significant. The final model explains 71% of the variance in violent crime in Austin and 56% in San Antonio.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings show a clear association between alcohol outlet density and violence, and suggest that the issues of alcohol availability and access are fundamental to the prevention of alcohol-related problems within communities.

Placement and readership (age and sex) data generated estimates of media exposure for the age groups 12 to 20, 21 to 34, and 21 years and older.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gross rating points, an advertising industry standard measure of the level of media exposure of a given population, and gross rating point ratios comparing exposure of different demographic groups.; RESULTS: Alcohol companies spent 590.4 million US dollars to place 471 beer and ale advertisements (8%), 4748 distilled spir-its advertisements (76%), 116 low-alcohol refresher advertisements (2%), and 904 advertisements for wine (14%) in magazines in 2001 and 2002. In 2002, underage youth saw 45% more beer and ale advertising, 12% more distilled spirits advertising, 65% more low-alcohol refresher advertising, and 69% less advertising for wine than persons 21 years and older. Girls aged 12 to 20 years were more likely to be exposed to beer, ale, and low-alcohol refresher advertising than women in the group aged 21 to 34 or women in the group aged 21 years and older. Girls' exposure to low-alcohol refresher advertising increased by 216% from 2001 to 2002, while boys' exposure increased 46%.; CONCLUSION: Exposure of underage girls to alcohol advertising is substantial and increasing, pointing to the failure of industry self-regulation and the need for further action.

AB The current environmental experience of young children includes few opportunities for physical activity and an overabundance of high calorie foods. Sedentary lifestyles and poor nutrition challenge children who are predisposed to metabolic disorders. Obesity is a logical response to this challenge. To prevent clinically significant obesity and later metabolic disease in predisposed youth, all sectors of society must work together to support strategies to change public opinion and behavior across the life span. Parental education in all medical settings is strongly recommended, especially if the parent(s) are obese, beginning with the first pregnancy visit to the physician. Schools should be primary targets for efforts to educate parents concerning the reduction of TV, computer games, and unhealthy snacks. Schools should be encouraged to adopt vending machine policies that promote healthy drinks and food in appropriate portion sizes and discouraged from providing unhealthy food as rewards for positive behavior or academic accomplishment. Schools should provide daily physical education and frequent periods of unstructured play in young children. Clinical treatment should be both encouraged and financially supported in children who are already overweight. Community wide efforts to increase awareness and promote environments that encourage physical activity and healthy nutrition are needed.

AB Emerging findings from developmentally focused research indicates subtle but important neurocognitive disadvantages among adolescents with alcohol-use disorders (AUD) as compared to teens without AUD. Even after 3 weeks of abstinence AUD youth display a 10% decrement in delayed memory functions. Neuropsychological testing of youth followed at 4 and 8 years demonstrates that heavy drinking during adolescence is associated with diminished retrieval of verbal and nonverbal material, and poorer performance on tests requiring attention skills. Alcohol withdrawal over the teen years appears to uniquely contribute to deterioration in functioning in visuospatial tasks. Brain imaging studies suggest reduced hippocampal volumes, white matter microstructure irregularities, brain response abnormalities while performing challenging cognitive tasks, and enhanced brain response when viewing alcohol cues (i.e., alcohol advertisements) among adolescents with AUD. Family characteristics such as history of alcoholism and socioeconomic status as well as personal features, including adolescent psychopathology, gender, and age of onset must be carefully considered when investigating the influence of teenage drinking on neurocognition. Further research is needed to understand how age at onset of drinking and duration of abstinence at the time of assessment affect cognitive findings. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify neuromaturational changes associated with early alcohol exposure and patterns of resiliency. Although the magnitude of alcohol-related effects observed in adolescents' neurocognition is relatively modest, the implications are major given the prevalence of alcohol involvement, and the important educational, occupational, and social transitions that occur during adolescence.

AB BACKGROUND: Early studies assessing propensity of alcohol sales to underage youth found that, before intervention, likelihood of licensed alcohol establishments selling alcohol to underage youth was 50% or higher across many communities. Community-wide interventions successfully lowered underage alcohol sales rates in several communities. Across studies assessing propensity for alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons, sales rate estimates ranged from 58% to 85% for on-premise establishments (e.g., bars). No previous studies have assessed likelihood of alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons in off-premise establishments (e.g., liquor stores). One goal of this study was to assess propensity for illegal alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons at on- and off-premise establishments. Another goal was to assess whether server and/or establishment characteristics were related to the likelihood of illegal sales. Results may inform future interventions to reduce illegal alcohol sales at licensed alcohol establishments.; METHODS: Trained actors attempted to purchase alcohol while acting out signs of obvious intoxication at a census of on- and off-premise alcohol establishments (n = 372) in 11 communities. The outcome variable was whether an establishment sold alcohol to a buyer. Independent variables included age and gender of server/clerk, type of establishment, area, exterior maintenance, type of license, and time of purchase attempt. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.; RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the establishments sold alcohol to a buyer (83% and 76% at off- and on-premise establishments, respectively). Servers/clerks who appeared younger than age 31 and off-premise establishments were significantly more likely than older appearing servers and on-premise establishments to sell alcohol to buyers.; CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons in licensed alcohol establishments is very high. Interventions to reduce illegal alcohol sales to intoxicated patrons are needed.

AB Although research indicates that school meal programs contribute to improved academic performance and healthier eating behaviors for students who participate, fewer than 60% of students choose the National School Lunch Program or School Breakfast Program. School meal programs have a difficult time competing with foods that are marketed to young people through sophisticated advertising campaigns. Youth's preferences for fast foods, soft drinks, and salty snacks; mixed messages sent by school personnel; school food preparation and serving space limitations; inadequate meal periods; and lack of education standards for school foodservice directors challenge school meal programs as well. A coordinated school health program offers a framework for meeting these challenges and provides children and adolescents with the knowledge and skills necessary for healthful eating. This article identifies challenges facing school foodservice directors in delivering healthful meals and acquaints dietetics professionals with the coordinated school health program to be used as a tool for addressing unhealthful weight gain and promoting healthful eating.

AB BACKGROUND: Popular culture (movies, television shows, advertising) often portrays drinking to the point of intoxication as either humorous or associated with enjoyable social activities that enhance quality of life. This study examined the association between binge drinking (consuming five or more alcoholic drinks on one occasion) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among U.S. adults.; METHODS: Data are from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a continuous random-digit-dial telephone survey of adults aged >/=18 years conducted in all states. This survey included questions about alcohol consumption and HRQOL.; RESULTS: In 2001, 52% of U.S. adults were current drinkers (one or more drinks in the past 30 days). Of current drinkers, 11% were frequent binge drinkers (three or more episodes in past month) and 14% were infrequent binge drinkers (one to two episodes in past month). After adjusting for confounding factors, frequent binge drinkers were more likely than non-binge drinkers to experience >/=14 unhealthy days (physical or mental) in the past month (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.24-1.56), primarily because they had more mentally unhealthy days than non-binge drinkers (AOR=1.52, 95% CI=1.32-1.75).; CONCLUSIONS: Frequent binge drinking is associated with significantly worse HRQOL and mental distress, including stress, depression, and emotional problems. Effective interventions to prevent binge drinking should be widely adopted and may help improve quality of life.

AB This paper provides a profile of clients seen by male sex workers (MSWs) in Cordoba, Argentina. Thirty-two MSWs completed a diary after each paid sexual encounter with a client over a two-week period. The results show that 254 commercial sex encounters were reported. More than half of these encounters were with first time clients. The most common source of recruiting clients was advertisements followed by street contact. The majority of the clients were aged in their 30s or 20s, and identified as 'middle class' and 'bisexual' or 'gay'. In the majority of the encounters, alcohol or drugs were not used by clients, and in about less than half of the cases, the MSWs had some personal tracing information about the client. Most of the clients indicated to the MSW what sexual activity they wanted and unsafe anal sex was requested in a minority (6%) of the encounters. While most workers reported having no or little attraction to the client, most indicated that they would serve the client again. The implications of the results for public health education and further research are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: Public health policy guidelines recommend that health care providers (eg, physicians, nurses, others) counsel adolescent smokers to quit and that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may be considered to aid in smoking cessation for nicotine-dependent youth. This recommendation is discrepant with Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling of NRT products, stating that they not be sold to persons younger than 18 years. It is not clear how easily minors are able to purchase NRT products in retail markets.; OBJECTIVE: To explore youth access to NRT by conducting the first study, to our knowledge, to determine the ability of minors to purchase over-the-counter NRT products.; DESIGN: Observational case series of NRT purchase attempts and survey description of store characteristics.; SETTING: Retail businesses in Memphis, Tenn.; PARTICIPANTS: Population-based sample of 165 stores that sold over-the-counter medications.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Successfully completed purchase attempts of NRT by the minor buyer.; RESULTS: In most stores that stocked NRT products, the age of the minor was not queried at any time during the purchase attempt (79%) and the minor was able to successfully purchase the product (81%). If the minor was asked her age, the store was much less likely to sell the NRT product. Stores in which a cash register gave an age query prompt or in which alcohol was sold were more likely to inquire about the minor's age and less likely to sell NRT products.; CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine replacement therapy products were successfully obtained in most purchases by a minor buyer without proof of age. While ease of purchasing NRT products is potentially beneficial to young smokers attempting to quit, these purchases are discrepant with Food and Drug Administration labeling regarding the sale of NRT products to minors.

AB OBJECTIVES: To test whether high school students' participation in advocacy activities related to the advertising, availability, and use of tobacco in their communities would prevent or reduce their own tobacco use.; DESIGN: Ten continuation high schools in northern California, randomly assigned to a semester-long program in which students either carried out advocacy activities to counter environmental-level smoking influences in their communities (treatment) or learned about drug and alcohol abuse prevention (control).; PARTICIPANTS: Eleventh and 12th grade high school students; 5 (advocacy) treatment and 5 control schools over 4 semesters from 2000 through 2002.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported smoking defined as nonsmokers (those who had never smoked tobacco or those who were former smokers), light smokers (those who smoked <1 pack per week), or regular smokers (those who smoked >or=1 pack per week), and confirmed by carbon monoxide level readings. The following 3 constructs related to social cognitive theory- perceived incentive value, perceived self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies-were assessed.; RESULTS: There was a significant net change from baseline to the end of the semester (after the intervention) between treatment and control schools for students who were regular smokers, but not for students who were nonsmokers or light smokers. Regular smoking decreased 3.8% in treatment schools and increased 1.5% in control schools (P<.001). Regular smoking continued to decrease at 6 months after the intervention in treatment schools, with a total change in prevalence from 25.1% to 20.3%. Involvement in community-advocacy activities and the 3 social constructs-perceived incentive value, perceived self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies-also showed significant net changes between treatment and control schools (all P values <.01).; CONCLUSION: Student engagement in community-advocacy activities that addressed environmental influences of cigarette smoking resulted in significant decreases in regular smoking.

AB OBJECTIVE: The spirits market in Switzerland was reformed in 1999 in accordance with the World Trade Organization agreement. The resulting tax reform and increased competition have resulted in markedly reduced prices for foreign spirits, and a previous study showed that spirits consumption increased significantly after the tax reform. The present study examined whether alcohol-related problems also increased at follow-up and if they did, whether the increase was the result of increased spirits consumption. Further correlates of alcohol-related problems were also explored.; METHOD: Data were obtained from a longitudinal study on changes in alcohol consumption in Switzerland. The baseline survey was conducted 3 months before the tax reform, and the follow-up was conducted 28 months after the tax reform. A randomly selected sample of 4,007 residents aged 15 years or older participated in the baseline survey, and 73% of this sample participated in the follow-up survey. Alcohol consumption was measured on the basis of a graduated frequency, and alcohol-related problems were measured by items taken from the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT).; RESULTS: Findings indicate that alcohol-related problems increased significantly at follow-up. The significance disappeared, however, after controlling for spirits consumption, indicating that the increase of alcohol-related problems at follow-up was mainly mediated through increased consumption of spirits. The multiple regression models showed that spirits, beer and wine consumption, gender, Age*Spirits Consumption interaction, region, smoking status, heavy-drinking frequency and average number of drinks were significant correlates of alcohol-related problems.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-related problems increased at the follow-up, particularly among younger age groups who consumed more spirits. Prevention programs on alcohol-related problems should target young people.

This study identified correlates of lifetime alcohol use, recent alcohol use, and binge drinking among youth in sixth through 10th grade (n = 2,004) in Sarasota County, Fla. Results from a closed-ended, quantitative survey acknowledged a range of personal, social, and environmental influences. Breadth of these influences supports a need for multifaceted, community-based interventions for effective prevention of youth alcohol use. This study was unique because it represents population-specific research in which community partners are using the findings to develop community-specific social marketing interventions to prevent underage drinking and promote alternative behaviors.

AB About one third of the economical costs, which are due to death, sickness and life quality deficits in higher developed industrial countries, are caused by pollutants such as nicotine, alcohol and false eating habits. Within a period of one year 183,000 people in Germany die on tobacco associated sickness effects, 73,000 on direct or indirect aftermath of alcohol usage and a proportional amount of mostly adipoptic people on the hereoff resulting sickness effects. These risk trias, decided by every person mainly for himself by his own behaviour or mis-behaviour, are even aggravated by the free enterprise sanctioned drug politics of the highly profitable mega markets of the tobacco-, alcohol- and fast-food-industry. Health orientated drug politic, which is based on independence and solidarity and an exhaustive primary prevention within the scope of early nationalization authorities can therefore only have a limited effect. Even though, standardized, therapeutic short interventions used by hazardous alcohol- and drug usage, the qualified detoxification on addiction illness and an way to little used meanwhile time- and cost optimized withdrawal treatment have been proven to be quite effective. Exhaustive established ambulant smoking-withdrawal treatment programs are of special importance, because with continuously sinking of first contact, nicotine is know to be the "gate way drug" with the strongest addiction potential among all legalized and non-legalized drugs. In canon of mean while worldwide (except for Germany) started drug-control politics one will be able to start a health orientated drug politic in the future, which is including especially the drug economic aspects for the benefit of all as well as for the national budgets.

AB Adolescents tend to overestimate peer drinking; the resulting misperception of the social norm predicts the child's own future drinking. This study examined the misperception's relatedness to a person's drinking pattern in order to facilitate the segmentation of the audience for health education interventions. Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Survey (Finland) data on 14 year olds' drinking patterns and perceptions of peer drinking were gathered using self-administered mailed questionnaires in 1989 (N = 3105, response rate 77%), 1995 (N = 8382, 79%) and 2001 (N = 7292, 70%). The perceptions of peer drinking were significantly related to respondents' drinking patterns. Non-drinkers and those drinking recurrently until drunkenness held reasonably correct views of their peers' drinking. However, the segment between these two extremes comprising around half of the cohort incorrectly thought that their peers drank more; they misperceived the normative drinking pattern to be drunkenness. From health education perspective, three different target audiences can be identified: non-drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers. The intermediate group, drinkers not normally getting drunk, holds the view most influenced by the social norm misperception and are likely to feel pressured to increase their drinking. The social norms marketing approach to health education should find this group the most viable target.

Alcohol advertising, the price of alcohol, and the degree to which underage drinking laws are enforced also play a role. It is difficult to establish the degree to which alcohol use is influenced by environmental factors. This article describes some of the environmental influences that may increase the risk for underage drinking.

It is suggested that marketing is a powerful mechanism for attracting young consumers. The alcohol industry is an innovative industry able to use a wide variety of marketing tools to achieve success in the market-place. It is important to recognise that the marketing activities of the industry are becoming increasingly transnational and that policy response has to be equally transnational. Copyright 2004 S.

Data were collected via a questionnaire administered to 283 students 30 days after the closing ceremonies.. Logistic regression was used to predict recent alcohol consumption. Significant predictors were race (non-white) (OR = 3.9), religiosity (OR = .72), having a parent who drinks (OR = 4.8), the number of best friends who drink (OR = 2.5), and the interaction for "Bud World Party" attendance and gender (OR = 33.2). Post-hoc analysis of the interaction effect indicated that the relationship between "Bud World Party" attendance and recent alcohol consumption is moderated by gender. Girls who visited "Bud World Party" were more likely than the boys to have consumed alcohol in the past 30 days. In addition, the girls who visited "Bud World Party" were more likely to believe that drinking would increase their chances of popularity at school than the students who did not.

AB This study tests whether the impact of alcohol advertising exposure on intentions to drink and actual consumption is mediated by cognitive responses to advertising messages and positive expectancies about alcohol use. The model was tested using survey data of two important age cohorts, 15 to 20 years (n=608) and 21 to 29 years (n=612). The findings show that alcohol advertising was influential in shaping young people's attitudes and perceptions about alcohol advertising messages. The attitudes and perceptions predicted both positive expectancies and intentions to drink of those under the legal drinking age, but did not affect the young adults' expectancies and consumption. Positive expectancies were powerful predictors of intentions to drink and consumption for both groups. The effects of alcohol advertising on intentions to drink of those aged 15 to 20 years were mediated by cognitive responses to advertising messages and positive expectancies. The mediation effect was not evident among those between 21 and 29 years.

AB Theoretical approaches to alcohol and violence have emphasized three interrelated domains of influence: the situational context, aggression-facilitating characteristics of individuals, and the impact of alcohol consumption. We examined these three domains as predictors of experiencing violence in the barroom setting. Participants were recruited through one of two phone surveys or through newspaper advertisements and classified into one of three groups: Experienced Bar Violence (EBV), Observed Bar Violence (OBV), and No Bar Violence (NBV). They completed questionnaires assessing individual difference and alcohol use variables, and an interview that assessed characteristics of their usual bar. The results suggested that individual difference and alcohol variables distinguished men in the EBV group from men in the OBV and NBV groups. However, women in the EBV group were distinguished from women in the NBV group by the characteristics of their usual bar and by the alcohol variables, but were distinguished from the OBV group only in terms of individual difference variables. The implications of these findings with respect to the influence of alcohol on barroom violence are discussed.

AB Our objective was to determine the level of HIV/AIDS knowledge of pregnant women in India. In a sub-sample of these women, we documented the extent to which they experienced adverse social and physical difficulties within their home. The study was performed at an urban antenatal hospital clinic in Maharastra, India. From April to September 2001, structured interviews were conducted on 707 randomly selected antenatal clinic patients related to HIV/AIDS knowledge. Of these, 283 were further interviewed to document any social or physical difficulties they experienced. Over 75% of women displayed knowledge of primary transmission routes. Nearly 70% of women demonstrated knowledge of maternal to child transmission, however, only 8% knew of any methods of prevention. TV and written material were more strongly related to knowledge than access to radio messages or conversations with individuals. Thirty per cent of the women experienced physical or mental abuse or their spouse's alcohol and/or drug problems. Women reporting such abuse were more than twice as likely to have adequate HIV/AIDS knowledge compared with women reporting no such abuse. We found no relationship between reported household abuse and educational level of woman, husband, occupation of either partner, language or religion. We found no relationship between HIV status and knowledge of HIV and no relationship between HIV status and risk of abuse in the household. However, the total number of HIV patients in our sample was very small.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify if particular foods or food groups may be associated with obesity in children and adolescents and to determine if consuming food away from home (FAFH) has an effect on the nutritional quality of their diets.; DESIGN: One-year cross-sectional study.; SETTING/SUBJECTS: The obese subjects (n = 91) were on the waiting list for a hospital-based weight control treatment program. The non-obese subjects (n = 90) were recruited from community advertisements.; MEASURES OF OUTCOME: Information on food intake was obtained using the dietary history method by a Registered Dietitian. Body fat was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis.; RESULTS: Obese children and adolescents consumed significantly more servings of meat and alternatives, grain products, FAFH, sugar-sweetened drinks and potato chips which contributed to a higher calorie, fat and sugar intake compared to non-obese children and adolescents. Sugar-sweetened drinks were only significantly greater in boys. The consumption of meat servings, sugar-sweetened drinks and FAFH was positively correlated with percent body fat. The frequency of food consumed outside of the Canada's Food Guide To Healthy Eating was not different between the two groups.; CONCLUSIONS: Obese children and adolescents need to limit their access to food consumed away from home and sugar-sweetened drinks as there is a relationship between these foods and body fatness.

AB BACKGROUND: The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was enacted in 1997 to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured low-income children from families who earned too much to be eligible for Medicaid.; OBJECTIVES: To develop a "baseline" portrait of SCHIP enrollees in 5 states (Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Indiana, and New York) by examining: 1) SCHIP enrollees' demographic characteristics and health care experiences before enrolling in SCHIP, particularly children with special health care needs (CSHCN), racial and ethnic minority children, and adolescents; 2) the quality of the care adolescents received before enrollment; and 3) the changes in enrollee characteristics as programs evolve and mature.; METHODS: Each of 5 projects from the Child Health Insurance Research Initiative (CHIRI) surveyed new SCHIP enrollees as identified by state enrollment data. CHIRI investigators developed the CHIRI common core (a set of survey items from validated instruments), which were largely incorporated into each survey. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to ascertain whether there were racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care and differences between CSHCN and those without. Current Population Survey data for New York State were used to identify secular trends in enrollee characteristics.; RESULTS: Most SCHIP enrollees (65% in Florida to 79% in New York) resided in families with incomes < or =150% of the federal poverty level. Almost half of SCHIP enrollees lived in single-parent households. A majority of SCHIP parents had not had education beyond high school, and in 2 states (Alabama and New York) approximately 25% had not completed high school. The vast majority of children lived in households with a working adult, and in a substantial proportion of households both parents worked. Children tended to be either insured for the entire 12 months or uninsured the entire 12 months before enrolling in SCHIP. Private insurance was the predominant form of insurance before enrollment in SCHIP in most states, but 23.3% to 51.2% of insured children had Medicaid as their most recent insurance. HEALTH CARE USE AND UNMET NEEDS BEFORE SCHIP: The vast majority of all SCHIP enrollees had a usual source of care (USC) during the year before SCHIP. The proportion of children who changed their USC after enrolling in SCHIP ranged from 29% to 41.3%. A large proportion of SCHIP enrollees used health services during the year before SCHIP, with some variability across states in the use of health care. Nevertheless, 32% to almost 50% of children reported unmet needs. CSHCN: The prevalence of CSHCN in SCHIP (between 17% and 25%) in the study states was higher than the prevalence of CSHCN reported in the general population in those states. In many respects, CSHCN were similar to children without special health care needs, but CSHCN had poorer health status, were more likely to have had unmet needs, and were more likely to use the emergency department, mental health care, specialty care, and acute care in the year before enrolling in SCHIP than children without special health care needs. RACE AND ETHNICITY: A substantial proportion of SCHIP enrollees were black non-Hispanic or Hispanic children (Alabama: 34% and <1%; Florida: 6% and 26%; Kansas: 12% and 15%; and New York: 31% and 45%, respectively). Minority children were poorer, in poorer health, and less likely to have had a USC or private insurance before enrolling in SCHIP. The prevalence and magnitude of the disparities varied among the states. QUALITY OF CARE FOR ADOLESCENTS: Seventy-three percent of adolescent SCHIP enrollees engaged in one or more risk behaviors (ie, feeling sad or blue; alcohol, tobacco, and drug use; having sexual intercourse; and not wearing seat belts). Although almost 70% of adolescents reported having had a preventive care visit the previous year, a majority of them did not receive counseling in each of 4 counseling areas. Controlling for other factors, having a private, confidential visit with the physician was associated with an increased liked likelihood (2-3 times more likely) that the adolescent received counseling for 3 of 4 counseling areas. TRENDS OVER TIME: New York SCHIP enrollees in 2001, compared with 1994 enrollees in New York's SCHIP-precursor child health insurance program, were more likely to be black or Hispanic, older, from New York City, and from families with lower education, income, and employment levels. A greater proportion of 2001 enrollees was uninsured for some time in the year before enrollment, was insured by Medicaid, and lacked a USC. Secular trends in the low-income population in the state did not seem to be responsible for these differences. Program modifications during this time period that may be related to the shift in enrollee characteristics include changes to benefits, outreach and marketing efforts, changes in the premium structure, and the advent of a single application form for multiple public programs.; CONCLUSIONS: SCHIP enrollees are a diverse group, and there was considerable variation among the 5 study states. Overall, SCHIP enrollees had substantial and wide-ranging health care needs despite high levels of prior contact with the health care system. A sizable minority of SCHIP enrollees has special health care needs. There is racial and ethnic diversity in the composition of enrollees as well, with racial and ethnic disparities present. The quality of care adolescents received before enrollment in SCHIP was suboptimal, with many reporting unmet health care needs and not receiving recommended counseling. The characteristics of SCHIP enrollees can be expected to change as SCHIP programs evolve and mature.; POLICY IMPLICATIONS: 1) Benefits should be structured to meet the needs of SCHIP enrollees, which are comparable to Medicaid enrollees' needs in many respects. 2) Provider networks will have to be broad if continuity of care is to be achieved. 3) Multiple outreach strategies should be used, including using providers to distribute information about SCHIP. 4) The quality of care delivered to vulnerable populations (eg, minority children, CSHCN, and adolescents) should be monitored. 5) States and health plans should actively promote quality health care with the goal of improving the care received by SCHIP enrollees before enrollment. 6) States will have to craft policies that fit their local context. 7) Collecting baseline information on SCHIP enrollees on a continuous basis is important, because enrollee characteristics and needs can change, and many vulnerable children are enrolling in SCHIP.

AB OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study was designed to record the perception by Newcastle children of the influences on their choice of drinks and their knowledge of the dental health problems caused by acidic drinks.; METHODS: Four focus groups, each involving 8 Newcastle schoolchildren (4 boys and 4 girls) formed the basis of the study. Two age groups, 13-14-year-olds and 8-9-year-olds, and two socio-economic groups were investigated, using state schools in Newcastle upon Tyne. A moderator guided the children to discuss their choice of drink and its dental effects amongst themselves.; RESULTS: In total, 32 children participated in the focus groups and the results suggested that 8-9-year-olds preferred still, fruit-flavoured drinks whilst 13-14-year-olds preferred carbonated drinks. Taste was the most important influence on drink choice in all age groups. Parents and friends were more influential in younger children, whilst cost, availability and thirst were more important to older children. Younger children did not believe advertisements whilst older children thought they might work if seen enough times. Dental knowledge was confused in all age groups and only the 13-14-year-old-high socio-economic groups knew that acidic drinks were bad for the teeth. Different methods for addressing the problem of erosion were suggested by different age groups. There was very little difference between the socio-economic groups in the areas discussed.; CONCLUSIONS: The children's knowledge of dental diseases and the effect of drinks on the teeth were confused. The factors that influence drink choice appear to change with age, rather than socio-economic status.

AB Between 1978 and 1997 the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Hannover Medical School examined 17 fatal autoerotic deaths. The incidence for the Hannover region was 0.49 cases per million inhabitants per year. The victims included 17 men with an average age of 36.8 years; a peak in the age distribution was seen between 20 and 29 years. Twelve of the men were found by friends or family in a domestic environment, while other situations in which the victims were found included the victim's own car, a hotel room, a canal embankment, a public parking lot as well as the holding cell of the youth detention center. The men were of varying socioeconomic status and held a number of different types of jobs or still attended school. Five of the men were found completely nude, while five were only undressed below the waist. Four men wore women's clothes and two were fully clothed with exposed genitals. Besides women's clothes, other objects found at the scene included various types of sexual aids, including ropes, chains, metal bars, locks, sex magazines, condoms, plastic bags, rubber items, etc. In four cases blood alcohol levels between 0.1 and 2.5 per thousand (urine alcohol levels between 0.2 and 2.5 per thousand ) were found. Toxicologic examination revealed chloroform, ketamine, a propane-butane gas mixture in one case each, and in two cases cocaine and morphine. Causes of death included central paralysis after strangulation (seven cases), asphyxiation (4), subarachnoid hemorrhage (2), intoxication (1), hypothermia (1), left heart failure (1), and drowning (1). The history, findings at scene, and autopsy findings and, in individual cases, other investigations are of utmost importance to accurately reconstruct a fatal autoerotic accident.

AB For the assessment of exposure to food-borne chemicals, the most commonly used methods in the European Union follow a deterministic approach based on conservative assumptions. Over the past few years, to get a more realistic view of exposure to food chemicals, risk managers are getting more interested in the probabilistic approach. Within the EU-funded 'Monte Carlo' project, a stochastic model of exposure to chemical substances from the diet and a computer software program were developed. The aim of this paper was to validate the model with respect to the intake of saccharin from table-top sweeteners and cyclamate from soft drinks by Italian teenagers with the use of the software and to evaluate the impact of the inclusion/exclusion of indicators on market share and brand loyalty through a sensitivity analysis. Data on food consumption and the concentration of sweeteners were collected. A food frequency questionnaire aimed at identifying females who were high consumers of sugar-free soft drinks and/or of table top sweeteners was filled in by 3982 teenagers living in the District of Rome. Moreover, 362 subjects participated in a detailed food survey by recording, at brand level, all foods and beverages ingested over 12 days. Producers were asked to provide the intense sweeteners' concentration of sugar-free products. Results showed that consumer behaviour with respect to brands has an impact on exposure assessments. Only probabilistic models that took into account indicators of market share and brand loyalty met the validation criteria.

AB We test whether or not labor market frustration is associated with clinical alcohol abuse/dependence diagnoses among labor migrants living in California. Our sample consists of 1576 Mexican labor migrants in Fresno, CA, who migrated for the purpose of seeking employment. Using clinical criterion (DSM-III-R), we find that frustrating experiences resulting from labor market exclusion and discrimination are significantly related to past-year alcohol abuse/dependence. Similarly, although high levels of social support are salutary, they are not protective among those who experience moderate/high levels of employment frustration. Since Mexican-origin immigrants have low rates of health insurance coverage and lower propensities for formal help-seeking, community outreach programs that target labor migrants are essential to this population's mental health maintenance.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic characteristics of adolescent boys and girls who engage in three sedentary behaviors (television/video use, computer use, and reading/homework), and to explore how each sedentary activity is associated with body mass index (BMI), dietary behaviors, and leisure time physical activity.; DESIGN: This study draws on data collected from Project EAT (Eating Among Teens), a school-based survey examining personal, behavioral, and socioenvironmental factors that are associated with nutritional intake among adolescents.; SUBJECTS: The study sample consists of 4746 middle and high school students from 31 public schools in a metropolitan area of the upper Midwest. All students were invited to participate. The overall response rate for Project EAT was 81.5%. Data collection was completed during the 1998-1999 school year.; STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariate linear regression was used for examining associations between independent and dependent variables, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All differences were considered statistically significant at P<.05.; RESULTS: Among boys, television/video use and time spent reading/doing homework were positively associated with BMI (P<.05), whereas for girls television/video and computer use were positively associated with BMI (P<.05). High television/video use among boys and girls was associated with more unhealthful dietary behaviors (eg, increased consumption of soft drinks, fried foods, and snacks) (P<.05). In contrast, time spent reading/doing homework was associated with more healthful dietary behaviors (eg, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables) (P<.05). Leisure time physical activity was not associated with television/video use among boys or girls, but was positively associated with computer use and time spent reading/doing homework (P<.05). Applications/Conclusions Messages and advice aimed at reducing time spent in sedentary activities should be targeted at television/video use instead of time spent reading, doing homework, or using a computer. Nutrition education should incorporate messages about the influence of the media and advertising on dietary behaviors.

AB AIMS: To identify correlates of beer advertising awareness among adolescents at an age when most initiate use of alcohol.; DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of an in-school survey about alcohol advertising. Structural equation modeling was used to test for independent predictors of a latent beer advertising awareness construct, separately among boys and girls.; SETTING: Twenty middle schools in South Dakota, USA participated during their spring semester.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1530 eighth graders.; MEASUREMENTS: A latent advertisement awareness variable was derived based on recognition of six masked beer advertisements, knowledge of beer brands and knowledge of beer slogans. Tested predictors included measures of exposure to alcohol advertising in various venues, social norms regarding drinking, drinking beliefs and behavior and gender.; FINDINGS: Adolescents with greater exposure to advertisements in magazines, at sporting and music events and on television were more advertisement aware than those with less exposure, as were teens who watch more TV, pay attention to beer advertisements and know adults who drink. Beer advertisement awareness was dramatically higher among boys, and was associated with drinking only among boys.; CONCLUSIONS: Each of a variety of advertising venues appears to influence independently the extent to which beer advertising is incorporated into an adolescent's cognitive world. Boys are more likely to be aware of and remember beer marketing, and may be more likely to drink as a result of this awareness than girls.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of obesity among sixth- and seventh-grade students in a school-based setting, and to identify lifestyle parameters associated with obesity.; METHODS: Sixth- and seventh-grade students (n = 385, 186 boys and 199 girls) from 3 schools participated in a school-based screening study, and 319 completed a short questionnaire. Height and weight were measured, and body fat as a percentage of body weight was obtained using a Tanita bioelectrical impedance scale.; RESULTS: Overall, 35.3% of students had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) at or above the 85th percentile, and half these students (17.4%) had a BMI at or above the 95th percentile. Rates were higher among Latino and lower among Asian than non-Hispanic white students. Significant associations were found between BMI and hours of television watched per evening and daily soft drink consumption. The mean (SE) BMI z score for those watching less than 2 hours per night (0.34 [0.09]) was lower than for those watching 2 or more hours per night (0.82 [0.08]; P<.001). The mean (SE) BMI z score for those consuming less than 3 soft drinks per day (0.51 [0.07]) was lower than for those consuming 3 or more soft drinks per day (1.02 [0.13]; P =.003). Latino students watched more television (2.4 hours per night) than did non-Hispanic white or Asian students (1.3 hours per night; P<.001 for each) and consumed more soft drinks (1.6 per day) than non-Hispanic white students (1.1 per day; P =.004) or Asian students (0.7 per day; P<.001).; CONCLUSIONS: Time spent watching television and the number of soft drinks consumed were significantly associated with obesity. Latinos spent more time watching television and consumed more soft drinks than did non-Hispanic white or Asian students. These findings will be beneficial in developing preventive measures for these children.

AB BACKGROUND: Sugar rich drinks are a recognised risk factor in early childhood caries. Currently, in depth knowledge of factors influencing parents' choice of infant drinks is incomplete.; OBJECTIVES: This study investigated parents and carers understanding of feeding practices potentially detrimental to oral health; barriers to adopting safe feeding practices and commercial factors influencing feeding bottle and cup contents.; METHODOLOGY: A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was employed. Interviews were conducted by an experienced researcher and tape recorded. Following full transcription, emerging themes were identified, systematically explored and validated within the verbatim accounts. Thirty-three parents/carers of children aged three years and under, resident in areas of high caries prevalence in Cardiff, Wales, were interviewed.; RESULTS: Overall understanding of the prolonged effect of exposure to sugared drinks in feeding bottles and cups was poor. Greater concern was expressed over the use of bottles on the development of the occlusion. Milk was viewed as a food rather than as a drink. Many barriers to giving water were described: children reject it; mothers don't like it; it was 'cruel' to offer water instead of sweet drinks; water in feeding bottles or cups was seen as a sign of poverty. Commercial influences on choices were strong. Products offered by baby food manufacturers were viewed as safe, but a recently marketed "Toothsafe" drink was viewed with suspicion.; CONCLUSIONS: There are significant barriers to adopting the traditional oral health education message, that only milk and water are truly safe for teeth. Future oral health education and promotion programmes must recognise and account for these factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyse prevailing food patterns among Spanish children and young people and their relationship to sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey.; SETTING: Population study. Data were collected at participants' home addresses.; SUBJECTS: Random sample of the Spanish population aged 2-24 y (n=3534; 1629 boys and 1905 girls).; INTERVENTIONS: Food consumption was assessed by means of a 24-h recall and a food frequency questionnaire. Sociodemographic and lifestyle related data were collected by specially designed questionnaires, previously pretested and validated. All the information was collected during a personal interview by trained dietitians.; DATA COLLECTION: May 1998-April 2000.; RESULTS: Average consumption of fruit and vegetables was low. The youngest age group (2-5 y) showed the lowest proportions of inadequacy for the dairy group (P<0,001; chi(2)=39.11 boys; chi(2)=49.60 girls). Factor analysis identified five main components of dietary patterns. The 'Snacky' pattern was characterised by more frequent and higher consumption of bakery products (buns, cakes and biscuits), sweets, salted snacks and soft drinks. Higher intakes of fruit, vegetables and fish were associated to the 'Healthy' pattern. Children whose mother had a low level of education and those who spent more than 2 h daily watching TV were more likely to follow the 'Snacky' pattern. Girls were more likely to follow the 'Healthy' pattern, while children and young people whose mother had a lower level of education were less likely.; CONCLUSION: Results from this study highlight the importance of enhancing school-based and community-based actions to promote healthy eating and physical activity addressed to children and young people.

A random-digit-dial telephone survey of parents or guardians of children ages 10-17 years was conducted after a four-week advertising flight. Respondents with unassisted recall of the commercial more often disagreed that parent-child discussion is useful only if children have begun to experiment with alcohol, and more often reported having three or more parent-child discussions about alcohol compared to those who did not recall the commercial. Findings suggest the potential benefit of paid media campaigns to encourage parents to talk with their children about alcohol.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examines how communities, neighborhoods and stores influence retail pricing and promotion of beer.; METHOD: In the year 2000, trained field staff conducted observations in 2,024 retail alcohol stores in 160 communities throughout the contiguous United States. Based on a nationally representative sample of schools, we selected communities defined by the school's catchment area, or the vicinity from which the majority of students are drawn. We randomly selected off-sale alcohol retail establishments from a complete list of stores likely to sell tobacco or alcohol in the selected communities. Beer price and promotions are based on observations of Miller and Budweiser beer brands in the stores. Neighborhoods are defined by the store's census block. We used cross-sectional, hierarchical regression models and mixed methods procedures to analyze data.; RESULTS: Community, neighborhood and store characteristics were related to beer price; however, only community and store characteristics were predictive of beer promotions.; CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the pricing and promotion of beer vary systematically by some characteristics of communities, neighborhoods and stores, but not significantly by the number of young people populating a neighborhood. In addition, pricing and promotion of Budweiser and Miller beers, in particular, do not appear to target racial minority populations. Because of the significant effect of store characteristics, public health agencies and advocates might focus prevention efforts on collaborations with liquor control agencies to reduce variations in pricing and promotion of beer, which ultimately encourage risky drinking behaviors. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of pricing and promotion on alcohol-related social problems.

AB OBJECTIVE: Comprehensive tobacco control policies for US colleges and universities have been proposed by several groups in order to counter the rising use of tobacco by students enrolled in these institutions. Student opinion of these policies is not known, and concern about student opposition is one barrier that deters administrators from adopting the policies. This study measured student support for recommended college tobacco control policies.; DESIGN: Mailed survey of US college students (2001 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study).; SETTING: 119 nationally representative, four-year colleges and universities in the USA.; PARTICIPANTS: 10,904 randomly selected undergraduate students enrolled at participating schools.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Students' opinion of 7 proposed tobacco control policies.; RESULTS: A majority of students supported each policy. Over three quarters of students favoured smoke-free policies for all college buildings, residences, and dining areas, while 71% supported prohibiting tobacco advertising and sponsorship of campus social events, 59% favoured prohibiting tobacco sales on campus, and 51% supported smoke-free campus bars. All policies had more support among non-smokers than smokers (p < 0.001). Among smokers, support for policies was inversely related to intention to quit and intensity of tobacco consumption. Because college students' tobacco consumption is low, a majority of smokers favoured banning smoking in college buildings and dining areas and prohibiting tobacco marketing on campus.; CONCLUSIONS: Student support for proposed campus tobacco control policies is strong, even among smokers, and broadly based across demographic subgroups. These findings should provide reassurance to college administrators who are considering adopting these policies.

AB BACKGROUND: Abrupt changes in the alcohol consumption level and the suicide rate associated with the anti-alcohol campaign of 1985-1991 and the market reforms of 1992.; METHODS: Epidemiological investigation of total Russian suicide rate and per capita alcohol consumption utilizing the Box-Jenkins technique and regression analysis.; RESULTS: The decrease of per capita consumption from 14.2 to 10.5 l in 1985-1987 and the growth of this index after 1987 (14.6 l in 1994) saw a respective decline and increase of suicides per litre of alcohol: eight males and one female per 100,000 of the corresponding population (13 or 6% of male or female suicides and 12% total suicides). The maximum suicide rate was reached in 1994 (41.8 per 100,000 population, in 1981-1994 r=0.91). In 1984-1986 and 1991-1994 the distribution of suicides' age was close to that of the age distribution from fatal alcohol poisoning. Changes in the level of BAC-positive suicides are closely correlated with changes in the alcohol consumption level (r=0.98), whereas changes in the number of BAC-negative suicides were not related to changes in consumption.; CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption level plays a considerable role in the suicide rate, especially for male suicides. The rate of alcohol-related suicides is very high in Russia, owing to the very high alcohol consumption rate in the country.

AB OBJECTIVE: Availability of confectionery from vending machines in secondary schools provides a convenient point of purchase. There is concern that this may lead to 'over-indulgence' and hence an increase in susceptibility to obesity and poor 'dietary quality'. The study objective was to investigate the association between the frequency of consumption of confectionery purchased from vending machines and other sources and related lifestyle factors in adolescent boys and girls.; DESIGN: A secondary school-based, cross-sectional study.; SUBJECTS AND SETTING: A total of 504 subjects were investigated (age range 12-15 years), from three schools in southern and northern England. Using a lifestyle questionnaire, frequency of confectionery consumption (CC) from all sources (AS) and vending machines (VM) was recorded for a typical school week. Subjects were categorised into non-consumers, low, medium and high consumers using the following criteria: none, 0 times per week; low, 1-5 times per week; medium, 6-9 times per week; high, 10 times per week or greater.; RESULTS: No differences were found in the frequency of CC from AS or VM between those who consumed breakfast and lunch and those who did not. No differences were found in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake in high VM CC vs. none VM CC groups, or in any of the VM CC groups. Confectionery consumption from AS (but not VM) was found to be higher in subjects who were physically active on the journey to school (P<0.01) but also higher in those who spent more time watching television and playing computer games (P<0.01). No associations were found between smoking habits or alcohol consumption and frequency of CC.; CONCLUSIONS: These results do not show a link between consumption of confectionery purchased from vending machines and 'poor' dietary practice or 'undesirable' lifestyle habits. Findings for total confectionery consumption showed some interesting trends, but the results were not consistent, either for a negative or positive effect.

AB On December 10, 2002, the Clark County Combined Health District and the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) were notified of two hospitalized children infected with Salmonella Enterica serotype Typhimurium. Initial investigation implicated consumption of raw, unpasteurized milk purchased at a local combination dairy-restaurant (dairy) during November 27-December 13, 2002, as the cause. This report summarizes the subsequent investigation. Because 27 states still allow the sale of raw milk, and organizations continue their efforts to allow marketing and sale of raw milk to the public directly from the farm, consumer education about the hazards of raw milk and a careful review of existing policies are needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Cue reactivity studies in alcohol-dependent adults have shown atypical physiological, cognitive, and neural responses to alcohol-related stimuli that differ from the responses of light drinkers. Cue reactivity and its neural substrates are unclear in youth. We hypothesized that teens with alcohol use disorder would show greater brain response than nonabusing teens to alcohol images relative to neutral beverage images in limbic and frontal brain regions.; METHODS: We tested the hypotheses in a cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Adolescents aged 14 to 17 were recruited from local high schools. Teens with alcohol use disorders (n = 15) and demographically similar infrequent drinkers (n = 15) met strict exclusion criteria (no left-handedness or neurological, other psychiatric, or other substance use disorders). Diagnoses were determined by means of structured and semistructured clinical interviews. Subjects were shown pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverage advertisements during blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Self-reports of craving were obtained before and after cue exposure.; RESULTS: Teens with alcohol use disorders showed substantially greater brain activation to alcoholic beverage pictures than control youths, predominantly in the left anterior, limbic, and visual system areas (P<.05; cluster threshold, 515 microL). The degree of brain response to the alcohol pictures was highest in youths who consumed more drinks per month and reported greater desires to drink.; CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous studies by demonstrating an association between the urge to drink alcohol and blood oxygen use in areas of the brain previously linked to reward, desire, positive affect, and episodic recall. This study extends this relationship to adolescents with relatively brief drinking histories using visual alcohol stimuli, and suggests a neural basis for response to alcohol advertisements in youths with drinking problems.

AB This study employs an implicit personality rating methodology from marketing research (the "shopping list" method) to investigate young adults' perceptions of young women who drink alcoholic beverages. Whereas there were some differences in perceptions of young women drinkers across the alcohol brands, the greatest differential in the personality ratings was caused by the mere presence or absence of alcohol. Young women who drink alcohol were described as being more "interesting" and "self-assured" than young women who do not drink. These positive traits were reliably ascribed to young women drinkers by both young adult men and young adult women and more strongly by those who themselves drink. Although it is possible that young women drinkers really are differentially interesting and self-assured, a more likely contributor to these perceptions is advertising aimed at the female drinker.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between body mass index (BMI) levels and various lifestyle variables related to physical activity and specific characteristics of a healthy eating pattern, using baseline cross-sectional data from the Wellness IN the Rockies project.; SUBJECTS: A total of 928 males and 889 females, aged 18-99 y, recruited from six rural communities in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.; MEASUREMENTS: Using BMI as the criterion, overweight was defined as a BMI >or=25 kg/m(2) and obesity was defined as a BMI >or=30 kg/m(2). All participants in this study completed a questionnaire that elicited sociodemographic information, self-reported height and weight, and data related to specific dietary intakes, eating-related behaviors, and physical activity behaviors and perceptions.; RESULTS: Prevalence of overweight was 70% in men and 59% in women. Increased likelihood of overweight or obesity was associated with greater frequency of the following: drinking sweetened beverages such as soft drinks/soda pop, ordering supersized portions, eating while doing other activities, and watching television. Other predictors were lower frequency of participation in physical activity and the perception of not getting as much exercise as needed.; CONCLUSIONS: The increased probability of having a high BMI in individuals who more often eat while doing another activity appears to be a novel finding that will need to be substantiated by additional research. The finding that the vast majority of overweight and obese respondents believed that they do not get as much exercise as needed strengthens the assertion that finding ways to increase participation in physical activity should remain a high priority in obesity prevention and intervention efforts at the community and individual levels.

AB CONTEXT: Adolescent drinking is a major public health concern. The federal government does not restrict alcohol advertising to adolescents, but relies on the alcohol industry for self-regulation.; OBJECTIVES: To investigate recent alcohol advertising in magazines and to determine whether advertising frequency is associated with adolescent readership.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: All alcohol advertisements were counted that appeared from 1997-2001 in 35 of 48 major US magazines, which tracked their adolescent readership (3 refused all alcohol advertisements; and advertisement counts were unavailable for 10). Variation was assessed in the advertisement placement frequency for each major category of alcohol (beer, wine and wine coolers, and distilled liquor) by a magazine's adolescent readership (age 12-19 years), young adult readership (age 20-24 years), and older adult readership (age > or =25 years); readership demographics (sex, race, and income); year; frequency of publication; and cost per advertisement.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Variation in alcohol advertising frequency by adolescent readership.; RESULTS: Adolescent readership ranged from 1.0 to 7.1 million. The alcohol industry placed 9148 advertisements at a cost of 696 million dollars. Of the 9148 advertisements, 1201 (13%) were for beer, 443 (5%) for wine, and 7504 (82%) for liquor. After adjustment for other magazine characteristics, the advertisement rate ratio was 1.6 times more for beer (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.6; P =.05) and liquor (95% CI, 1.1-2.3; P =.01) for every additional million adolescent readers. Wine industry advertising was not associated with adolescent readership.; CONCLUSIONS: Magazine advertising by the beer and liquor industries is associated with adolescent readership. Industry and federal policymakers should examine ways to regulate advertising that reaches large numbers of adolescents.

AB AIMS: To investigate the relationship between several indicators of socioeconomic status and drinking patterns in young adulthood.; DESIGN: Data collected in a longitudinal study of young adults was analysed using repeated-measures models to examine the relationship between income, occupational activity and educational achievement and patterns of drinking.; SETTING: These data were collected as part of a longitudinal study ofa birth cohort of New Zealanders. They were interviewed for the most part in a central location using a face-to-face method and a computer-assisted alcohol interview.; PARTICIPANTS: The participants were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development study aged 18, 21 and 26 years. Nine hundred and sixty-nine study members contributed to the analysis. Study members have been found to be broadly representative of the New Zealand population and cross national studies suggest findings are generalizable to other similar market economies.; MEASUREMENTS: Three indicators of socioeconomic status were used; educational achievement, occupational activity and income. The educational achievement indicator at age 18 had three levels that ranged from no school qualifications to higher school qualifications. For age 21 two additional categories of tertiary educational achievement were included to make five categories and for age 26 higher tertiary degrees were included in the measure to make six categories. Five categories of occupational activity were used. Income data was also used. Two measures of alcohol consumption were used. These were the frequency of drinking and the typical quantity of alcohol consumed per drinking occasion in the past year.; FINDINGS: Frequency of drinking increased over these early adult years and the quantities consumed peaked at age 21 and decreased thereafter for both males and females. Frequency of drinking was influenced by income with the higher income respondents drinking more often and this was persistent overtime. Quantity of drinking was most influenced by educational achievement. The less well-educated young adult drank significantly more during a drinking occasion and at all ages. There was also a relationship between educational achievement and frequency of drinking for males at age 18 and a relationship between women's occupational activity and the quantities they consumed.; CONCLUSIONS: The finding that the dimensions of drinking operate differently explains the lack of consistency in previous research, which has investigated socioeconomic status and the volumes of alcohol consumed. The findings of higher quantities consumed among those of lower social status may explain some of the reduced life expectancy found among those with lower socioeconomic status.

AB BACKGROUND: Little research (and fewer interventions) has been done on longitudinal exposure to risk factors for chronic diseases in young people in Latin America, including Mexico, although chronic diseases constitute the first cause of death in Mexico. Our objective was to document the prevalence of chronic disease risk factors among adolescents as a baseline measurement for a cohort study and to develop educational interventions.; METHODS: Questionnaires, blood samples, and anthropometric measurements were collected from 13,293 public school students of both sexes, ages 11-24 years in Morelos, Mexico. This constitutes the baseline measurement for a cohort study. Twenty focus groups and 10 in-depth interviews were done with girls aged 12-17 years. Two educational interventions promoting physical activity and sexual health were designed.; RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 21.2%. On average, participants spent 0.5 h/day on vigorous physical activity and 3.7 h/day watching television. Sexual initiation was reported by 14.5% (girls = 9.1%, boys = 21.5%); 52.3% of whom reported using condoms. Young women demonstrated correct condom use and perceived themselves at risk for HIV/AIDS but did not have condom negotiation skills. Prevalence of experimenting with tobacco was 15.1% (girls = 10.4%, boys = 21.1%); current smoking was 14.4% (girls = 10.6%) and boys = 19.2%), while 6.3% of participants reported monthly intoxication with alcohol, and 4.5% reported past and 2.1% reported current illegal drug use.; CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate substantial exposure to risk factors for chronic diseases and reproductive health problems in this population. The study will generate interventions and constitutes initiation of a longitudinal study able to explore causal associations between risk factors and chronic diseases in this population.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report on the sociodemographic characteristics and work experiences of 31 male sex workers (MSWs) in the city of Cordoba, Argentina.; METHODS: Information on each of the MSWs was collected using a questionnaire that covered his personal characteristics and his work background, self-assessed general health status, and use of health and social services. Scales were included in order to assess attitudes towards condom use, knowledge about safe sex, perceptions about the risk of getting HIV, individual self-efficacy, and locus of control. The questionnaire also asked each respondent to rank his level of agreement with interactive strategies for gaining client compliance with safe sex practices.; RESULTS: In terms of their self-identity, out of the 30 MSWs who answered the question, 10 of them (33.3%) self-identified as heterosexual and 9 (30%) as bisexual. Alcohol and drug consumption and unsafe sexual practices were relatively low among the MSWs. Of the 31 MSWs responding, 21 of them (67.7%) reported that they had been tested for HIV, but only 13 of them (41.9%) said they had been vaccinated for either hepatitis A or hepatitis B. A variety of differences were found between the study's 17 street sex workers (sex workers who offer their services in public places such as streets and parks) and the 14 independent sex workers (sex workers who are self-employed, advertise and manage their own business, and have an exclusive location for their commercial sex work). The street MSWs were younger and had less formal education. Independent MSWs were economically more settled, had been working longer in the sex industry, and were more comfortable about having sex with men. Independent MSWs were also more likely to report a gay sexual orientation and less likely to report using alcohol, marijuana, or other substances.; CONCLUSIONS: The differences between street MSWs and independent MSWs are important since they could influence the negotiating of safer sex practices with clients. Programs aimed at preventing the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and promoting responsible self-care among MSWs in Cordoba should be introduced. Such programs could increase the proportion of MSWs who know their HIV serostatus and could make MSWs more aware of the risk of different sex acts performed in commercial sex encounters. Given the differences that we found between street MSWs and independent MSWs, specific strategies and educational materials should be developed for those two subgroups within the MSW population.

AB Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States, accounting for approximately 100,000 deaths annually. Efforts to reduce the adverse health and social consequences from alcohol use include policies to restrict access to alcohol among underaged persons (i.e., persons aged <21 years) and to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among persons of all ages. Recent studies have focused on alcohol marketing as a potentially important contributor to alcohol consumption, particularly among underage drinkers. Point-of-purchase (POP) (i.e., on-site) marketing, including alcohol advertising and placement, can increase alcohol sales and consumption substantially, thereby increasing the risk for various alcohol-related health outcomes, including alcohol-impaired driving and interpersonal violence. To assess the type and frequency of POP alcohol marketing, researchers with the ImpacTeen Project collected and analyzed store observation data during 2000-2001 from 3,961 alcohol retailers in 329 communities throughout the United States. This report summarizes the results of the study, which indicate that POP alcohol marketing is extensive in certain store types frequented by teenagers and young adults. Public health agencies and policy makers should work with liquor control boards to reduce POP marketing that could promote risky or underage drinking.

AB BACKGROUND: On July 1st, 1999, the spirits market in Switzerland was reformed based on the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement. The tax reform, in addition to increased competition, has resulted in a 30-50% decrease in price for foreign spirits (liquor). The purpose of the present study is to examine whether decreased prices due to the tax reform and the liberalized spirits market in Switzerland have had an effect on spirits consumption, and whether the effect differs by demographic and other correlates.; METHODS: The present study uses data from a longitudinal study on changes in alcohol consumption in Switzerland's resident population. The baseline survey was conducted 3 months before the tax reform and the follow-up was conducted 28 months after the tax reform. A randomly selected sample of 4007 residents aged 15 years or older participated in the baseline survey and 73% in the follow-up survey. The data were obtained by computer-assisted telephone interview, including detailed questions on alcohol consumption, drinking habits, problem drinking, purchase of spirits and socio-demographic characteristics.; RESULTS: Consumption of spirits increased after the price of spirits decreased. The increase in spirits consumption was consistent across subgroups, with the exception of the group aged 60 or older. Moreover, the increase in spirits consumption persisted even after adjustment for significant correlates of spirits consumption. Apart from age, there was no evidence that the increase in spirits consumption differed between subgroups as defined by sex, region, working status, education, smoking, drinking frequency, or average number of drinks.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that younger people are more affected by price than older persons. This study demonstrated that price should be considered an effective policy to reduce alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems, especially among the younger population.

AB Public opinion has been one factor affecting change in policies designed to reduce underage alcohol use. Extant research, however, has been criticized for using single survey items of unknown reliability to define adult attitudes on alcohol policy issues. The present investigation addresses a critical gap in the literature by deriving scales on public attitudes, knowledge, and concerns pertinent to alcohol policies designed to reduce underage drinking using a US probability sample survey of 7021 adults. Five attitudinal scales were derived from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses addressing policies to: (1) regulate alcohol marketing, (2) regulate alcohol consumption in public places, (3) regulate alcohol distribution, (4) increase alcohol taxes, and (5) regulate youth access. The scales exhibited acceptable psychometric properties and were largely consistent with a rational framework which guided the survey construction.

AB BACKGROUND: This paper examines neighborhood, outlet, and server characteristics related to successful purchases of alcohol by intoxicated patrons and underage drinkers at alcohol establishments. It is hypothesized that outlets in commercial areas near to other premises, with poor exterior maintenance, much advertising, and inexperienced youthful servers will be more likely to sell alcohol to intoxicated and underage patrons.; METHODS: Data were collected using pseudo-intoxicated patron and apparent minor surveys of randomly selected alcohol establishments in a metropolitan area of northern California. Data collection operations included independent surveillance of these drinking places to establish neighborhood and premise characteristics and pseudo-intoxicated patron and apparent minor stings to assess rates of these forms of illegal alcohol sales. Male actors feigning intoxication and female of-age youth identified as appearing to be 20 years or younger attempted to purchase alcohol at on- and off-premise establishments, respectively. Rates of sales (off-premise) and service (on-premise) were the primary outcomes.; RESULTS: Apparent minors purchased alcohol in 39% of attempts (95% CI, 34-45%) while pseudo-intoxicated patrons were served alcohol in 58% of attempts (95% CI, 50-67%). Sales to apparent minors were significantly related to percentage of Hispanic residents and areas with greater population density. Sales to pseudo-intoxicated patrons were more frequent when the server was male and appeared to be under the age of 30. These sales were also more frequent in Hispanic neighborhoods with high population density and high numbers of on-premise outlets but were less frequent in African American neighborhoods.; CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that underage and intoxicated patron sales differ by areas. Both forms of illegal sales of alcohol are more likely in highly populated areas of communities. The findings also suggest that server characteristics are strongly related to sales to intoxicated patrons, suggesting some leverage for responsible beverage service programs in these environments.

AB Although alcohol consumption is a problem on the college campus, beliefs and behaviors predictive of alcohol use are in development in children as young as third grade. Because they develop partially in response to interpretations of media messages, for which parents can have an influence, this study examined how college students' (N=300) recollections of parental reinforcement of media messages associated with alcohol-related beliefs and behaviors. Structural equation modeling showed that recalled positive mediation negatively predicted skepticism, and positively predicted desirability and expectancies. Desirability of media messages predicted more positive norms perceptions, and a lack of skepticism predicted more positive expectancies. With age of first experimentation controlled, expectancies predicted heavier current drinking behavior. Norms did not predict behavior, and positive mediation did not predict norms. The study concludes that to the extent parental communication leads adolescents to interpret media messages less skeptically, they encourage adolescents to find alcohol portrayals appealing. This in turn appears to lead toward more risky behaviors. The results suggest that college-based anti-alcohol campaigns can benefit by acknowledging the appeal of competing messages and by including parents as a campaign target.

AB OBJECTIVE: Since market liberalization in 1987, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau (TTWMB) annual statistics indicate that both the demand for imported cigarettes as well as the number of seized smuggled packs have increased with an average revenue loss of NT dollars 4942 million over the past 15 years. The NT dollars 10 average increase in cigarette prices after Taiwan entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the implementation of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Law in 2002 are forcing policy makers to examine smuggling even more closely. This study evaluates factors that affect an individual smoker's decision to purchase smuggled cigarettes, particularly when faced with higher prices.; DESIGN: 437 male smokers of imported cigarettes were drawn from a national interview survey on cigarette consumption, which the Division of Health Policy Research at the National Health Research Institutes conducted during the year 2000. Multiple logistic regression models were used to analyse the behaviour of purchasing smuggled cigarettes with respect to demographic factors, economic factors, smoking behaviour, and other variables.; RESULTS: Cigarette price was the driving factor most closely linked to the purchase of smuggled cigarettes--a 1% increase in cigarette price raised the likelihood of purchasing smuggled cigarettes at least 2.60 times (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.26). Smokers who spent more than NT 1000/month dollars on cigarettes were twice as likely to purchase smuggled cigarettes as those who spent less than NT 1000 dollars (odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.70). Betel nut chewers were more likely to purchase smuggled cigarettes (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.90). Smokers who opposed cigarette taxation policy were 1.69 times more likely to buy smuggled cigarettes. Personal income was not significantly associated with smuggled cigarettes purchases.; CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates what causes smokers to purchase smuggled cigarettes. We have determined that cigarette price is the most important factor and that betel nut vendors are the main suppliers. Our study provides policy makers with information that can help them develop effective strategies to curb cigarette smuggling after Taiwan's recent cigarette tax reform, which has increased cigarette prices.

AB The present study examined smoking culture and lifestyle Web sites listed on Yahoo!, a popular Internet search catalog, to determine whether the sites were easily accessible to youth, featured age or health warnings, and mentioned specific tobacco brands. A content analysis of photographs on these sites assessed the demographics of individuals depicted and the amount of smoking and nudity in the photographs. The sample included 30 Web sites, all of which were accessible to youth and did not require age verification services to enter them. Cigarette brand names were mentioned in writing on 35% of the sites, and brand images were present on 24% of the sites. Nearly all of the photographs (95%) depicted smoking, 92% featured women, and 7% contained partial or full nudity. These results underscore the need for greater research and monitoring of smoking-related Internet content by health educators and tobacco control advocates.

AB Alcohol-impaired driving is one of the major contributing factors to fatal and serious crashes in New Zealand. To curb the high level of road trauma resulting from drink-driving, a compulsory breath test (CBT) programme was introduced in 1993 and a supplementary road safety package (SRSP) in 1995/1996. The SRSP aimed to enhance road safety enforcement and advertising activities, and focused primarily on drink-driving and speeding. These interventions have resulted in a substantial reduction in alcohol-related road trauma. Subsequently, in 1999, the drinking age was lowered from 20 to 18 years. This paper examines the impacts of these drink-driving interventions. The analysis shows that the CBT programme and the SRSP have contributed to the reduction in alcohol-related crashes in recent years. There is also some evidence that, following the lowering of the drinking age, there has been an increase in drink-driving and subsequent alcohol-related crash involvement for drivers under 18 years.

AB This article analyzes information recently published by the Brazilian press on the use of psychoactive drugs and its implications on health. A sample of 502 newspaper and magazine articles published in 1998 was researched using content analysis. The drugs most frequently featured in the headlines were tobacco (18.1%), coca-derived drugs (9.2%), marijuana (9.2%), alcoholic beverages (8.6%), and anabolic steroids (7.4%). Solvents were featured in only one article, although they are the most commonly used drug in Brazil, second only to alcohol and tobacco. These data indicate an imbalance between the journalistic approach and the epidemiological profile of psychoactive drug consumption in Brazil. Dependence was the most frequent consequence mentioned in the articles (46%), followed by violence (9.2%), withdrawal syndrome (8.0%), and AIDS (6.8%). The focus of the articles varied according to the drug in question. While articles on marijuana focused on its therapeutic use and legalization, those on cocaine-related issues discussed both the damage caused by consumption as well as various interventions (treatment and repression).

AB Two hundred college students participated in an experiment investigating how individuals use television and real world experiences to construct alcohol use schema. Students were asked to write a story about a student who had a difficult day and, on arriving home, fixed himself a drink. In randomly assigned conditions, directions led the student to believe this was to be either a real world scenario or the setting for a television episode. Stories were coded for setting and social nature of use, quantity of use, consequences (both severity and valence), and overall tone. In general, stories characterized alcohol use as heavy, social, relaxing, and resulting in mostly minor consequences. Story characteristics did not differ based on direction type (real world vs. TV scenario). Students also completed a series of measures regarding television viewing habits, attitudes about alcohol use, and past experiences with use. Regarding television viewing patterns, those who watched more television overall created stories with more alcohol use. Viewing of dramas in particular was associated with less severe consequences as a result of use. In terms of personal experience with use, individuals who had driven under the influence of alcohol were more likely to construct a story with a positive tone and those who had passed out from drinking were less likely to conclude their stories with a moral tale discouraging drinking. The conclusion of this research is that both personal and observed experiences are important influencing factors in individuals' schema regarding alcohol use.

AB In an attempt to curb excessive drinking on college campuses, many universities have turned to "social norms" marketing campaigns. Despite widespread acceptance among health educators, empirical results are clouded by measurement problems. This study, based on a random sample of 550 students, examined the effects of misperceptions of friends' and typical college students' drinking on one's drinking behavior. Results indicate that drinking behavior is positively related to perceptions of friends' drinking as suggested by the theory of planned behavior, which emphasizes subjective as opposed to social norms.

AB This research investigated the prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and substance abuse in a midwestern university population following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington, DC. Three-hundred five subjects volunteered to complete a questionnaire which measured nine areas of psychosocial functioning which included demographics, personality, PTSD, MDD, prior traumatic experiences, alcohol and drug use, psychiatric history and treatment, and current attitudes towards government, religion, the economy, and how children were affected by the events. The participants lived in a large urban city over which United Flight 93 circled before crashing in Pennsylvania due to terrorist attacks. The subjects were forced to evacuate their university and city due to attacks on New York and errant United Flight 93. The study also replicated the first two national studies on PTSD prevalence (Schuster, et al., 2002; Galea, et al., 2002). The results found a prevalence rate of 5.9% for probable PTSD, matching identically previous national surveys. There were higher levels of PTSD and MDD for females, those with less education and who were single or unmarried, and those who had a prior history of mental health problems or psychological trauma. PTSD and MDD were associated with higher levels of alcohol and drug use since September 11. Relations to active duty military personnel appear to moderate the perception of threat, suggesting the importance of affiliative kinship patterns to coping with stress. Finally, the concept of geographic and psychological proximity to the 'zone of danger' is discussed.

AB In an interdisciplinary approach the exposure to lead and cadmium of the population living in the vicinity of a Bulgarian non-ferrous metallurgical plant was studied to determine the routes of exposure. Two exposed villages situated 4 and 6 km SW and W, respectively,--in the plume of the plant's emissions--and a village for comparison situated 14 km SE of the plant were selected for the study. The blood of children aged 3-13 years from the exposed villages (n = 111) and the village for comparison (n = 18) was analyzed for lead (PbB) and cadmium (CdB) as well as for free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) and haematological parameters. A personal questionnaire concerning nutrition habits and life-style was filled in by interviewers of the children's parents. The cadmium levels in blood were within the variation range stated for Bulgaria. The exposed children had a mean CdB of 0.38 +/- 0.18 microgram/l (range 0.10-0.90 microgram/l) and the comparison group 0.31 +/- 0.35 microgram/l (0.06-1.42 micrograms/l). The mean PbB value measured in the exposed children was 240 +/- 96 micrograms/l (77-631 micrograms/l), while the mean value of PbB for the reference group was 149 +/- 57 micrograms/l (63-285 micrograms/l). Individual PbB levels > 150 and > 200 micrograms/l were found in 85% and 62%, respectively, of the exposed children and FEP > 80 micrograms/dl erythrocytes was detected in 21%. There was a concentration-response and a concentration-effect relationship (r = 0.51, D > 0.001) between PbB and FEP. According to the questionnaire only 10.3% of the interviewed families in the two exposed villages buy all food from the market, the others produce a significant part of their food themselves. The PbB levels of children who consume certain foods of local production (cabbage, cereals, poultry, and beef) were significantly higher compared to the PbB values of children whose families purchase these foods from the market. No significant relationship between lead in children's blood and the use of tin and ceramic utensils, drinking and irrigation water, hygiene habits, family tobacco smoking habits, playgrounds and traffic intensity were revealed. There was a significantly higher incidence of prematurely born babies in the exposed population. The proven relationship between lead intake via the food chain and existing significant health risks is the basis for risk communication. Measures aimed at healthier nutrition and life-style intend to contribute to decreasing the risk of the population living in the smelter region.

AB BACKGROUND: In adolescents aged 12-14, we measured attitudes to tobacco advertising. Our purpose is to understand the relation of these attitudes to tobacco use and identify the groups most influenced by the advertising.; METHODS: Survey of adolescents on Gran Canaria Island, Spain, about aspects of family, school, peers, tobacco consumption, and tobacco advertising. The subjects of the double-stratified cluster sample were 1910 students at the same grade level in 33 schools; 86.6% were 13 or 14 years old, and 51.2% were boys. We generated measures for attitudes to tobacco advertising from replies to seven questions with ordinal scales by an analysis of categorical principal components. To relate attitude to tobacco advertising and the profiles of these adolescents, we used multiple regression and logistic regression models.; RESULTS: Attitudes to tobacco advertising are related to some home and school factors, but most significantly to tobacco and alcohol consumption, to amount of time at home without adults, and to peer influence.; CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to draw up profiles of the students most vulnerable to tobacco advertising, and to cluster them in two groups, the "vitalists" and the "credulous." The effect of cigarette ads is different between these groups. This study can help to orientate smoking prevention.

AB PURPOSE: To identify person, social group, and environmental factors associated with uptake of binge drinking among a national sample of college students.; METHODS: Using self-reported responses of students in the 1999 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study (CAS), we regressed conceptually important predictors of binge drinking onto a dichotomized variable describing uptake in the freshman year. This was a random sample of full-time undergraduates provided by the registrar at each participant school (n = 119). For this study, we analyzed data describing a subset of the total sample comprising first year students aged < or =19 years, excluding transfers (n = 1894). The student CAS is a 20-page voluntary, anonymous mailed questionnaire containing student reports about their alcohol and substance use, school activities, and background characteristics. Analyses included univariate and multivariate logistic regression adjusting for school response rate and using the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) in the Statistical Analysis Software package to handle the within-college clustering owing to the sampling scheme.; RESULTS: College students who reported that they were exposed to "wet" environments were more likely to engage in binge drinking than were their peers without similar exposures. Wet environments included social, residential, and market surroundings in which drinking is prevalent and alcohol cheap and easily accessed. Findings held up in multivariate analyses that included variables describing person and social group characteristics. Students who picked up binge drinking in college also were more likely than their peers to report inflated definitions of binge drinking and more permissive attitudes about appropriate ages for legal consumption.; CONCLUSIONS: Binge drinking can either be acquired or avoided in college among students who report they did not binge drink in high school. Reducing college binge uptake may require efforts to limit access/availability, control cheap prices, and maximize substance free environments and associations.

AB Childhood overweight is a significant and growing health problem in the US and other parts of the world. Secular trend data in the US suggest that children have become substantially heavier over the last several decades and that their risk for a number of health problems is increasing as a result. Defining obesity in children has been difficult as assessing body fat is expensive and impractical. Body mass index (BMI), derived from weight and height, is used as a surrogate indicator in adults. In children, the consensus is to use BMI percentiles statistically derived from a reference population. There is evidence that the prenatal, early childhood, and adolescent periods are critical in the development of obesity but the mechanisms involved are yet to be elucidated. The recent rapid increase in childhood overweight and obesity is attributed to the modern obesogenic environment. Changes in dietary constituents including higher derivation of energy from nutritionally poor and energy dense foods, increased sweetened drink consumption, larger portion sizes, and more frequent intake of food outside the home have been associated with poorer diets and higher weights. Further, physical activity has reduced with decreases in school physical education classes and organized sports, fewer opportunities to expend energy for daily living activity due to more mechanization, lower frequency of walking and biking, and greater use of sedentary activities for leisure. Television watching remains the most common activity for children. There are significant health outcomes associated with childhood obesity, including the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, and greater prevalence of various medical problems including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome, orthopedic problems, and pseudotumor cerebri. Of further concern is the increased risk for obesity in adulthood with its attendant co-morbidities. Interventions are imperative but not widely studied. The most effective interventions include comprehensive behavioral management, dietary modification, and exercise. Family-based interventions have been most successful at maintaining long-term weight loss. School-based interventions have the potential to significantly impact childhood overweight as large numbers of children can be reached. However, such programs require long-term follow-up and are expensive. Very low calorie diets, pharmacotherapy, and surgery remain experimental options for children. More recently, metformin has shown promise in promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity among adolescents. Combining multiple approaches for treatment, addressing obesity-promoting sociocultural practices and policies, and focusing on prevention strategies will be necessary to address this epidemic.

AB Wine production in Argentina left its mark in alcoholic drinks, placing it much closer to the socio cultural habits of the Mediterranean Europeans of the middle of the 20th century than to the Saxon peoples where the priority was consuming distilled drinks. During the last twenty years a very important economic investment accompanied the changes in the patterns of alcohol use, basically because of the incorporation of adolescent and preadolescent population into the alcoholic drinks market. If the traditional permissive standard, which accepted the enjoyment of alcohol, was modified in the elements of culture that tended to set limits to its excess, evolution has leaned towards a culture that extends tolerance to excess, frequently referred to as an uncontrolled state. It is a change, which weighs even heavier upon those who are more vulnerable. Up to now although this has been evident in educational and economic areas, it can also be supported by other new factors. Historically, the focus of social concern has concentrated on those cases with alcohol dependence, as exemplified by the abstinence syndrome. The cultural trivialization of 'non addictive' levels of consumption, is sustained only by social tolerance. Preventive strategies must establish a system of alarm signals that target early detection, and as a result prompt attention. The variety of methods within the field of rehabilitation, in contrast to the scarce development in the secondary level, offers a sign of considerable bias in health policies. This is true both in the design of preventive programmes as well as in the training and organisation of support resources.

AB American teens today grow up in a world saturated with the mass media. In general, the media depict a world in which unhealthy behaviors such as physical aggression, unprotected sex, smoking, and drinking are glamorous and risk-free. We summarize what is known about the media's effects on four adolescent health issues that have been studied most comprehensively: violence and aggression; sex; obesity, nutrition, and eating disorders; and alcohol and tobacco use. A number of approaches that have potential for helping turn the media into more positive forces for adolescents' health are discussed

AB AIMS: The estimation of alcohol-related human losses in Russia in the 1980s and 1990s.; DESIGN: The estimation was made by comparing changes in the total number of deaths and in specific categories, and alcohol consumption in Russia during this time.; SETTING: The anti-alcohol campaign, launched in 1985, and the market reforms launched in 1992 were associated with large and rapid changes of alcohol-consumption in Russia.; FINDINGS: In the early 1980s, the aggregate number of direct and indirect alcohol-related life losses was more than 500,000 per annum, or 32% of total deaths. Half of the alcohol-related human losses in Russia over the period studied were due to accidents, poisoning and violence. Following the anti-alcohol campaign and reduction in annual per capita alcohol consumption from 14.2 (1984) to 10.5 l (1986), mortality decreased from 1161.6 to 1054.0 per 100,000 of the population. It is estimated that from 1986 to 1991 the lives of 1.22 million people were spared; that is, 11.4% of the number of deaths expected without the anti-alcohol campaign. All categories of deaths were reduced with the exception of neoplasms, infectious and parasitic diseases. In the period of the so-called market reforms both alcohol consumption and mortality increased sharply. The total number of alcohol-related deaths for 1994 was 751,000 in the population, or 33% of all deaths (direct and indirect losses). In 1995 alcohol consumption started to decrease. A decrease in mortality was registered despite the sharp deterioration of the quality of life in the country. However, a new growth of total mortality, fatal alcohol poisonings and number of alcohol psychoses began in 1999-2000.; CONCLUSION: The results of this study show the enormous scale of alcohol-related mortality in Russia. It has been revealed that alcohol-related deaths are at the top of the hierarchy of all premature deaths in the country. Decreasing alcohol consumption is an important means of decreasing total mortality in Russia.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify developmental trajectories of drinking between the ages of 18 and 26 years and to identify variables, amenable to policy influence, which predict these trajectories.; DESIGN: Longitudinal data were analysed using latent class mixture modelling.; SETTING: Participants were interviewed in a central location.; PARTICIPANTS: Provincial city birth cohort, cross-national studies suggest findings are generalizable to other similar market economies.; MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of drinking over the past year and the typical quantity consumed per drinking occasion were computed from five location-specific questions. Measures used to predict membership of trajectory groups were ease of access to alcohol, drinking on licensed premises, response to alcohol advertising, educational achievement, parental consumption, age of onset of regular drinking and living arrangements.; RESULTS: Three trajectories of quantities consumed showed reduced consumption after age 21 but one trajectory showed marked increases. Three trajectories of frequency of drinking increased or remained stable over time. Access to licensed premises at age 18 had the most significant impact on membership of the trajectory groups and educational achievement had a significant impact on membership of the heavier quantity trajectory groups. Parental alcohol consumption, access to alcohol at 15 years, liking for alcohol advertising, living arrangement and age of onset of regular drinking also influenced trajectory membership.; CONCLUSIONS: Quantity and frequency of drinking in adolescence and early adulthood had different trajectories. Membership of heavier drinking groups was affected by environmental influences which are subject to policy change, particularly that of earlier access to licensed premises. In a small group high-quantity consumption did not decrease at age 26.

AB There is no single "best" prevention program, and no one program or approach will stop all drug use. There are many effective research-based programs; the best approach for any particular population requires selecting the best intervention for the target population on the basis of a knowledge of the risk and protective factors in that population. Unfortunately, the most highly marketed school or family programs are generally not those programs with the best outcomes. The best approach to prevention is to begin early to reduce emerging behavioral and emotional problems in youth. Longer-lasting effects should accrue from changing school, community, and family environmental conditions that promote and maintain drug problems in youth. More and more prevention specialists are considering moving from a focus on the individual to changes in total systems or the environmental contexts that promote or hinder drug use. On the basis of economic considerations, the "whole family" systems-change approach of family skills training classes is becoming popular even in the managed care environment. The greatest challenge facing the drug abuse prevention field is to get information out to practitioners and communities about the best prevention programs, approaches, and principles of effectiveness. Researchers and funding agencies must learn how to effectively market the most successful programs to bridge the gap between research and practice. We must become as effective at marketing drug prevention programs as drug dealers are at promoting and selling drugs. Communities need health care professionals who are knowledgeable about substance abuse prevention and who can advocate the implementation and ongoing improvement of prevention programs with known effectiveness.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine what young people think about the tobacco company Philip Morris and how it affects their evaluations of the company's new television advertising.; DESIGN: Data were gathered in the context of a controlled experiment in which participants saw four Philip Morris ads about youth smoking prevention, four Philip Morris ads about charitable works, or four Anheuser-Busch ads about preventing underage drinking (the control group). Knowledge and opinion of Philip Morris were measured before ad exposure.; SETTING: A California state university in the San Francisco Bay area.; SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of undergraduates (n = 218) aged 18-25 years.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Advertising evaluation measured by 12 semantic differential scales.; RESULTS: A little more than half of the students knew that Philip Morris is a tobacco company. Neither this knowledge nor students' smoking status was related to their opinion of the company. Philip Morris ads were rated less favourably by students who were aware that the sponsor is a tobacco company than by students who were unaware.; CONCLUSIONS: Advertisements designed to discredit the tobacco industry typically avoid references to specific companies. This study suggests that such counter-advertising would benefit from teaching audiences about the industry's corporate identities.

AB This is a study of the secondhand effects of student alcohol use experienced by residents of neighborhoods near college campuses. We examined the relationship of a college's level of binge drinking and the number of alcohol outlets in the immediate area, to lowered quality of neighborhood life through such secondhand effects. Adults from 4661 households in the United States were interviewed through a stratified list-assisted random digit dialing telephone survey. The interview schedule included questions about residents' experiences of secondhand effects of alcohol use such as noise, vandalism or public disturbances. Reports about the quality of neighborhood life provided by respondents residing near colleges were compared with those of respondents who did not live near colleges; and reports of neighbors of colleges with high rates of binge drinking were compared with those of neighbors of colleges with lower rates. The presence of alcohol outlets in these areas was also compared. Residents near colleges and particularly near colleges with heavy episodic drinking reported the presence of more alcohol outlets within a mile. Those neighborhoods were characterized by lower socioeconomic status. Neighbors living near college campuses were more likely to report a lowered quality of neighborhood life through such secondhand effects of heavy alcohol use as noise and disturbances, vandalism, drunkenness, vomiting and urination. A path analysis indicated that the number of nearby alcohol outlets was an important factor mediating the relationship between colleges, especially those with high rates of binge drinking, and such secondhand effects. The results suggest that neighborhood disruptions around colleges due to heavy alcohol use may be reduced by limiting the presence of alcohol outlets in those areas, and the marketing practices that this engenders.

AB BACKGROUND: Alcohol self-administration in the laboratory has been used to evaluate pharmacological treatments and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie alcohol use in alcohol-dependent individuals. This study evaluated whether attenuation of serotonin synthesis via depletion of its precursor tryptophan reduces the amount of alcohol consumed in a self-administration paradigm in non-treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol use disorders.; METHODS: Individuals with alcohol dependence (n = 8) and alcohol abuse (n = 4) who were not seeking treatment were recruited by advertisement and participated in two test days, 1 week apart. Each test session was preceded by administration of a concentrated amino acid drink that resulted in a rapid and significant decline in plasma free tryptophan (active depletion) or a similar drink containing tryptophan (placebo depletion). Tests were conducted in a randomized, double-blind fashion. The test session began with a cue exposure session where subjects were exposed to their favorite alcoholic beverage and asked to rate their craving for alcohol. After this, subjects were administered a priming drink designed to raise blood alcohol levels to 0.02 g%. Subjects then had the opportunity to drink up to eight additional drinks, each designed to raise blood alcohol levels by 0.02 g%, or to receive $3 for each drink not consumed over a 2-hr period.; RESULTS: There were no significant differences in alcohol consumed or subjective intoxication with active tryptophan depletion compared with placebo. Self-reported craving correlated with the amount of alcohol consumed in the session.; CONCLUSIONS: These data question the dependence of alcohol self-administration on the ongoing synthesis of serotonin.

AB BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted in the context of the current increase in cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infections, the development of new diagnostic strategies, and an outreach to community-based youth center screening sites.; GOAL: The goal was to define the prevalence of genital C trachomatis infection among clients of youth-health clinics and to evaluate the feasibility of implementing genotyping as a tool for epidemiologic studies with use of urine specimens.; STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective pilot study at two community-based youth-health clinics for teenagers and adolescents. Enrollment followed a high school educational program and public advertising campaign on the common occurrence of nonsymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic chlamydial infection among sexually active young people. Voluntary, confidential, free screening of first-void urine was provided, and the samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Demographic and behavioral data were obtained. Positive samples were differentiated into genovars by genotyping with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR-amplified omp1 gene.; RESULTS: The prevalence of nonsymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chlamydial infection was 6.0% among women and 9.3% among men. A significant increase in the risk of infection was associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD) (P < 0.01). There was no statistical risk correlating with partner change during the past year, infrequent or inconsistent condom use during the past year, present use of contraceptive pills, smoking habits, or recent alcohol consumption. Genotype E was most common (60%) among both sexes. Genotypes F and K were second most prevalent for men (20%), and genotype D was second most prevalent for women (15%). Genotype K or F was found in 23% of cases.; CONCLUSION: Screening programs targeting sexually active adolescents attending youth-health clinics are important for detection of C trachomatis. Genotyping might become an efficient tool in epidemiologic studies. The impact of educational school- and community-based programs on STD among young people needs further evaluation.

AB This descriptive study was designed to assess coping strategies of female adolescents infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (N = 30). Results from the Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences Questionnaire (ACOPES) revealed that the most often utilized coping strategies identified by the adolescents were: listening to music, thinking about good things, making your own decisions, being close to someone you care about, sleeping, trying on your own to deal with problems, eating, watching television, daydreaming and praying. The adolescents also reported low utilization of certain maladaptive coping strategies such as alcohol and illicit drug usage. Chronic illnesses such as HIV, cancer and diabetes are difficult for adolescents because of the unique developmental tasks needed to understand the psychological and social impact caused by chronic illnesses. The research presented illustrates the complexities of stress and the effects of coping on psychological well-being, health behavior, and health. This research explores specific coping strategies used by HIV-infected adolescents. Findings provided baseline data of the various coping strategies of female adolescents infected with HIV in an outpatient setting. These findings may serve as a foundation for future studies on coping strategies among females infected with HIV. Furthermore, the findings may also be useful in developing an outpatient behavior-modification/coping effectiveness training program that is both gender-specific and culturally appropriate.

AB The dollar value of an illicit drug market is an important statistic in drug policy analysis. It can be used to illustrate the scale of the trade in a drug; evaluate its impact on a local community or nation; provide an indication of the level of criminality related to a drug; and can inform discussions of future drug policy options. This paper calculates the first ever demand side estimates of the New Zealand cannabis black market. The estimates produced are calculated using cannabis consumption data from the Alcohol & Public Health Research Unit's (APHRU) 1998 National Drug Survey. The wholesale value of the market is estimated to be 81.3-104.6 million dollars a year, and the retail value of the market is estimated to be 131.3-168.9 million dollars a year. These demand side estimates are much lower than the existing supply side estimates of the market calculated using police seizures of cannabis plants. The retail figure is four times lower than the lowest national supply side estimate (636 million dollars) and seven times lower than the highest national supply side estimate (1.27 billion dollars). The demand side estimates suggest a much smaller cannabis economy to fuel organized criminal activity in New Zealand than previous estimates implied.

AB The present study examined whether the tendency to experience negative affective states combines with smoking outcome expectancies to predict smoking behavior over time. Participants were 121 young adults and resource people recruited from 3 alcohol and drug treatment programs and through community advertisements. Each participant completed 3 interviews over a 4-year period. Results indicated that dispositional negative affect and positive smoking expectancies were significantly correlated with smoking behavior both within and across time. Expectations of positive and negative reinforcement partially mediated negative affect's relation with smoking across time. Positive expectancies did not function as a moderator of negative affect's relation with smoking behavior. These results represent an important step in incorporating smoking outcome expectancies into multivariate models of smoking risk.

AB Previous research of addictive substances suggests that use of alcohol, illicit drugs, and tobacco is overrepresented on prime-time television (TV). These studies, however, have relied on frequency counts of the substance, rather than the prevalence of use among characters. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence of alcohol, illicit drug, and tobacco users among characters on prime-time TV during 1995 and 1996 with rates of use in the United States. In addition, we determined if the ratio of male to female, young to old, and white to minority addictive substance users on prime-time TV were similar to the equivalent U.S. ratios. Comparing results for prime-time TV characters versus the U.S. population (respectively), 11.0% (99% CI, 9.8-12.1) drank alcohol versus 51.0%; 0.8% (99% CI, 0.5-1.1) used illicit drugs versus 6.1%; and 2.5% (99% CI, 2.0-3.1) smoked tobacco versus 28.9%. In addition, no consistent pattern was evident in our analyses that assessed whether addictive substance users on prime-time TV were more frequently represented as men, young, or minority compared to the similar U.S. ratio. These results indicate that contrary to prevailing beliefs, alcohol, illicit drug, and tobacco users are uncommon on prime-time TV and are less prevalent than in the U.S. population.

AB PURPOSE: To examine how adolescents' attitudes and social skills affect current substance use and intentions to use substances in the future.; METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to 2646 seventh graders in their classrooms. The questionnaire was developed to measure the frequency of tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use, anticipated use, positive attitudes toward drug use, self-efficacy to say "no," decision-making skills, advertising-viewing skills, anxiety-reducing skills, communication skills, drug-resistance skills, perception of peer substance use, and weapon-carrying behavior. Ethnicity classified respondents as "white" or "students of color" and family structure indicated one vs. two-parent families. Data were analyzed with Spearman's r, analysis of variance, and multiple linear regression.; RESULTS: Forty-one percent of students were minority, 50.6% female, over 90% were either 12- or 13-year-olds, and 69.9% lived in two-parent families. A multiple linear regression model demonstrated that self-efficacy to say "no, positive attitudes toward drug use, perception of peer substance use, male gender, weapon-carrying, and fighting accounted for 51% of the variation in the current use multiple substance scale. Anticipated substance use during the subsequent year was significantly associated with current substance use, positive attitudes toward drug use, self-efficacy to say "no, drug-resistance skills, weapon-carrying, and fighting behavior. This model accounted for 73.9% of the variance in anticipated substance use.; CONCLUSIONS: In today's world, where drug use is common, building adolescents' drug-resistance skills and self-efficacy, while enhancing decision-making capacity, may reduce their use of illegal substances.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) on the amount of cigarette advertisements visible from outside of over-the-counter tobacco retailers, for five specific premium brands and an "all other" category, for five types of establishments, and in three areas (windows/doors, building/other detached areas, and sidewalks); to assess the relation of total exterior retail cigarette advertising to illegal sales to youth.; METHODS: Observations were conducted on the number of cigarette advertisements visible from outside tobacco retail establishments in a paired convenience sample (n = 556) in Massachusetts before and after the MSA. Archival databases containing information on merchant compliance with age related sales laws during the time period were used to assess the relation of total cigarette advertising with sales to underage youth. Paired sample t tests assessed planned comparisons pre- to post-MSA; Spearman's rho tested associations for dichotomous variables.; RESULTS: Significant post-ban increases were observed in the prevalence of exterior cigarette advertising on gas (petrol) stations and gas mini/marts (gasoline retailers) buildings, windows, and doors. Significant declines were observed on windows of liquor stores. Winston advertising declined overall, while advertisements of the "all other" brand category increased. Correlations between advertising and illegal sales, while modest, were significant.; CONCLUSIONS: These pre- to post-MSA increases suggest the tobacco industry may be shifting expenditures selectively from billboard advertising to retailer exteriors more favoured by youth. Greater amount of cigarette advertising visible from outside over-the-counter tobacco retailers is associated with greater cigarette sales to minors.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of learning disorders, defined as repeating a year, in adolescents and associated social and health risk factors.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study of a cohort of 14-year-olds was performed. Data (medical, social and family history and anthropometric data) were collected by pediatricians and a self-administered questionnaire on school progress, health-related self-image, physical activity, leisure-time activities, family and social relationships, drug and alcohol consumption, and self-esteem was given to the adolescents.; RESULTS: Of 287 adolescents, three were excluded because of mental deficiency. Of the 284 adolescents included in the study (135 girls and 149 boys), 48 (16.9 %) had learning disorders. No significant differences were found between sexes (18.1 % in boys vs. 15.55 % in girls). Learning disorders increased with the number of siblings (p 0.003). The prevalence was greater in the lower social classes (classes I, II, III: 6 %; class IV: 15.9 %; class V: 33 %; p 0.019) and in families with psychosocial risk factors (48.4 % vs. 12.7 %; p > 0.0001). Adolescents with learning disorders participated less in sports (50 % vs. 60.6 %; p 0.03), read less frequently (8.3 % vs. 27.1 %; p 0.005) and watched more TV on working days (2.4 hours/day vs. 1.6 hours/day; p 0.033). Girls with learning disorders were less aware of contraceptive methods (71.4 % vs. 95.6 %; p 0.0002) and of sexually transmitted diseases (71.4 % vs. 93 %; p 0.003). Adolescents with learning disorders started smoking earlier (39.6 % vs. 20.8 %, p 0.0053) but no differences were found in regular smoking.; CONCLUSIONS: Learning disorders constitute a common problem requiring pediatric care due to their influence on adolescents' overall health and their relationship with risk factors such as lower awareness of birth control and sexually transmitted diseases, greater sedentariness, and earlier initiation of smoking.

AB INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to describe trends in food habits in Denmark derived from a food frequency survey conducted by the Danish Nutrition Council in 2001 and compare it to similar surveys from 1995 and 1998.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: A random population sample of 1000 men and women (aged 15-91 years) were interviewed by telephone. They were asked 13 food frequency questions about nutritionally important foods (yoghurt, milk, cheese, rye bread, wheat bread, sandwiches with fish, fish as the main meal, meat as the main meal, potatoes, rice/pasta, vegetables (two questions) fruit) and about the type of milk and fat spreads most often used.; RESULTS: Several of the changes seen from 1995 to 1998 had continued into the 1998-2001 period. The results showed increased frequencies for shredded salad/raw vegetables and rice/pasta, but reduced frequencies for meat as the main meal and potatoes. Fruit consumption had also increased between 1998 and 2001. Average frequencies differed by 13-28%. Another pronounced trend was the increased use of low-fat milk (< or = 0.5% fat) instead of whole milk (42% drinking low-fat milk in 2001 versus 28% in 1998) and the greater numbers who did not spread any kind of fat on their bread (40% versus 22% in 1995, for rye bread).; DISCUSSION: In general the observed trends point in the right direction in respect of food-based dietary guidelines and other recommendations. This indicates that the Danish population has been influenced by the nutritional messages and campaigns stressing fat reduction and increased intake of fruit and vegetables. An important factor in this context is the increasing availability of low-fat milk products on the Danish market. Whether or not the positive trends for foods included are supported by the rest of the diet remains to be answered.

AB OBJECTIVES: The overall aim was to examine how working conditions in 1993 influenced the occurrence of poor mental health in 1997 among women and men from the general population. Also, the relative importance of other living conditions in relation to poor mental health in 1997 was examined.; METHODS: A sample from the general Swedish population (originally examined in 1969) was followed up in 1993 and 1997. Data from these follow-ups were analysed, and both bivariate and multivariate analyses of associations between occupational and non-occupational conditions in 1993 and poor mental health in 1997 -- defined as sub-clinical depression, reduced psychological well-being and high alcohol consumption -- were performed.; RESULTS: Several occupational risk indicators were identified for poor mental health among women, especially sub-clinical depression and high alcohol consumption. Occupational factors such as shift work, job strain, no education at the employer's expense, low occupational pride, low stimulation at work and poor social support were related to poor mental health among women. For poor mental health among men, mainly sub-clinical depression, shift work and low occupational pride were identified as risk indicators. Non-occupational factors related to poor mental health among women were poor quality of social contacts, demanding life events, physical inactivity, high perceived physical load outside work and inadequate coping strategies. Among men, smoking and inadequate coping strategies were related to poor mental health.; CONCLUSIONS: The difference between women and men, regarding the numbers of identified occupational and non-occupational risk indicators, may partly be explained by the gender-segregated labour market, and partly by other explanations. In our study, we have not succeeded in collecting the relevant information about occupational conditions that is important for men's mental health.

AB A substantial proportion (44%) of traffic injury cases seeking emergency services in public hospitals had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.1 per cent or more. To reduce alcohol related traffic injuries and deaths, a law was enacted setting a criminal per se legal blood alcohol limit at 0.05 per cent in 1994. However, not until 1997, was an active public education program undertaken on a national scale to raise awareness against drink driving and to support law enforcement. This includes dissemination of knowledge through multiple channels e.g., roadside posters; stickers on the back of vehicles; sporadic radio and TV programs or spots; public announcements; press reports. In 1999, highly visible sobriety check points were set up as a measure for law enforcement. In order to systematically assess the campaign, multiple methods were used to collect relevant data. This report focused on the outcomes of the campaign based on hospital surveillance data in the emergency rooms of 4 public hospitals from March to November, 2000 on alternate months. It was found that the campaign succeeded in raising public awareness and support for law enforcement against drink driving. However, the proportion of road victims with illegal BAC seeking emergency care did not decline after 17 months of the campaign. Limitations and weaknesses of law enforcement activities were discussed along with recommendation for future action.

AB There are no gold-standard tests for evaluating a teen suspected of abusing substances. Awareness of the high prevalence of substance abuse in youth, a high index of suspicion, and a firm desire to be a part of the solution are all that is required to address the problem of substance abuse in youth. In an age of "dotcoms" and societal complexity that fosters an emotionally "disconnected" atmosphere by uniting adolescents only by what they buy, plug into, click on, or blast away, teens need trusted medical homes where caring pediatricians are available to give youth accurate and authoritative facts and care to help them build inner resilience and connect them to the pain and hurt of the people in their lives. Until now, the "three strikes and you're out" maxim has been applied in medical care. This maxim may work for baseball, Clintonomics, and practical office management strategies but is not recommended for addressing the needs of substance using or abusing youth who are prey to advertising strategies. The size of the marketing and advertising budgets of the alcohol and cigarette industries is an indication of the relentless marketing directed toward vulnerable youth. Pediatricians would be doing teens a disservice if they fail to countermand this marketing effect by not using the "rule of seven"--the "seven 'S' screen," seven education attempts, seven different ways over 7 years, and persistence over seven attempts of chemically dependent adolescents to quit. It has been said by Osler that "These are our methods--to carefully observe the phenomena of life in all its stages, to cultivate the reasoning of the faculty so as to be able to know the true from the false. This is our work--to prevent disease, to relieve suffering, to heal the sick," and provide HOPE always.

AB Economic research has contributed to the evaluation of alcohol policy through empirical analysis of the effects of alcohol-control measures on alcohol consumption and its consequences. It has also provided an accounting framework for defining and comparing costs and benefits of alcohol consumption and related policy interventions, including excise taxes. The most important finding from the economics literature is that consumers tend to drink less ethanol, and have fewer alcohol-related problems, when alcoholic beverage prices are increased or alcohol availability is restricted. That set of findings is relevant for policy purposes because alcohol abuse imposes large "external" costs on others. Important challenges remain, including developing a better understanding of the effects of drinking on labor-market productivity.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: To understand the context for tobacco smoking in young adolescents, estimating the effects of individual, family, social, and school related factors.; DESIGN: Cross sectional analysis performed by multilevel logistic regression with pupils at the first level and schools at the second level. The data came from a stratified sample of students surveyed on their own, their families' and their friends' smoking habits, their schools, and their awareness of cigarette prices and advertising.; SETTING: The study was performed in the Island of Gran Canaria, Spain.; PARTICIPANTS: 1877 students from 30 secondary schools in spring of 2000 (model's effective sample sizes 1697 and 1738).; MAIN RESULTS: 14.2% of the young teenagers surveyed use tobacco, almost half of them (6.3% of the total surveyed) on a daily basis. According to the ordered logistic regression model, to have a smoker as the best friend increases significantly the probability of smoking (odds ratio: 6.96, 95% confidence intervals (CI) (4.93 to 9.84), and the same stands for one smoker living at home compared with a smoking free home (odds ratio: 2.03, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.36). Girls smoke more (odds ratio: 1.85, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.59). Experience with alcohol, and lack of interest in studies are also significant factors affecting smoking. Multilevel models of logistic regression showed that factors related to the school affect the smoking behaviour of young teenagers. More specifically, whether a school complies with antismoking rules or not is the main factor to predict smoking prevalence in schools. The remainder of the differences can be attributed to individual and family characteristics, tobacco consumption by parents or other close relatives, and peer group.; CONCLUSIONS: A great deal of the individual differences in smoking are explained by factors at the school level, therefore the context is very relevant in this case. The most relevant predictors for smoking in young adolescents include some factors related to the schools they attend. One variable stood out in accounting for the school to school differences: how well they enforced the no smoking rule. Therefore we can prevent or delay tobacco smoking in adolescents not only by publicising health risks, but also by better enforcing no smoking rules in schools.

AB OBJECTIVE: The question addressed in this review is whether aggregate alcohol advertising increases alcohol consumption among college students. Both the level of alcohol-related problems on college campuses and the level of alcohol advertising are high. Some researchers have concluded that the cultural myths and symbols used in alcohol advertisements have powerful meanings for college students and affect intentions to drink. There is, however, very little empirical evidence that alcohol advertising has any effect on actual alcohol consumption.; METHOD: The methods used in this review include a theoretical framework for evaluating the effects of advertising. This theory suggests that the marginal effect of advertising diminishes at high levels of advertising. Many prior empirical studies measured the effect of advertising at high levels of advertising and found no effect. Those studies that measure advertising at lower, more disaggregated levels have found an effect on consumption.; RESULTS: The results of this review suggest that advertising does increase consumption. However, advertising cannot be reduced with limited bans, which are likely to result in substitution to other available media. Comprehensive bans on all forms of advertising and promotion can eliminate options for substitution and be potentially more effective in reducing consumption. In addition, there is an increasing body of literature that suggests that alcohol counteradvertising is effective in reducing the alcohol consumption of teenagers and young adults.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased counteradvertising, rather than new advertising bans, appears to be the better choice for public policy. It is doubtful that the comprehensive advertising bans required to reduce advertising would ever receive much public support. New limited bans on alcohol advertising might also result in less alcohol counteradvertising. An important topic for future research is to identify the counteradvertising themes that are most effective with youth.

AB UNLABELLED: The objective of this study was to determine adolescents' attitudes concerning the use of self-care and traditional medicines. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire with open-ended questions was completed by 543 adolescents aged 15-19 y. The results showed that the most frequent self-care activity for general health problems, in more than three-quarters of them, was self-medication; 14% of them resorted to minor home treatment such as taking care of wounds, bandaging or massages. Instructions for use were mentioned by 69% of adolescents as a way of choosing self-prescribed drugs. Natural medicines were used by 32% of the girls and 23% of the boys, mainly herbal teas or plant-based medicines, followed by homoeopathy. Self-care for emotional and relational problems mainly involved thinking about the problem and questioning themselves about their own behaviour or about the way they are. They also mentioned activities such as sports, going out, listening to music, watching television, and trying to think about something else by keeping themselves occupied. Natural medicines were used by 19% of the girls and 13% of the boys. Plant-based medicines or herbal teas were used most often, followed by drugs or alcohol, with homoeopathy in third place.; CONCLUSION: Self-care and alternative medicines were used by adolescents in this study for physical as well as for emotional or relational problems. Their use did not reflect dissatisfaction with physicians and hospital treatment or an objection to formal services, but rather was a choice of these approaches for their own specific characteristics. They were also viewed as being less harmful than conventional treatment.

Eighty-eight children were selected and 87 could be analyzed.; RESULTS: Sixty-four of 87 (76.3%) were FAS and 23 of 87 (23.7%) had closely alcohol-related diseases. The prevalence was between 7.1 and 14.1% and lower than expected from available data.; CONCLUSION: The study allowed to precise the social and familial factors predisposing to alcohol addiction during pregnancy. A TV prevention message will be broadcasted after this study.

SO Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition
VL 11 Suppl 3
PS S562-8
PY 2002
PD 2002 
AB Australia's food and health patterns are inextricably and increasingly linked with Asia. Indigenous Australians arrived in the continent via Asia and have linguistic connections with people who settled in south India; there was interaction and food trade between both South-East Asia and China and northern indigenous Australians over thousands of years. After European settlement in 1788, there have been several and increasing (apart from the period of the infamous White Australian Policy following the Colonial period and Independence, with Federation, in 1901) waves of Asian migration, notably during the gold rush (Chinese), the building of the overland Telegraph (Afghans), the Colombo Plan and Asian student education in Australia from the 1950s onwards (South-Eeast Asians), and with refugees (Vietnamese and mainland Chinese), and business (late twentieth century) and progressive family reunion. Each wave has injected additional food cultural elements and caused a measure of health change for migrants and host citizens. Of principal advantage to Australia has been the progressive diversification of the food supply and associated health protection. This has increased food security and sustainability. The process of Australian eating patterns becoming Asianized is evident through market garden development (and the introduction of new foods), fresh food markets and groceries, restaurants and the development of household cooking skills (often taught by student boarders). Most of the diversification has been with grain (rice), legumes (soy), greens, root vegetables, and various 'exotic fruits'. Food acculturation with migration is generally bi-directional. Thus, for Asians in Australia, there has been a decrease in energy expenditure (and a lower plane of energy throughput), an increase in food energy density (through increased fat and sugary drink intakes), and a decrease in certain health protective foods (lentils, soy, greens) and beverages (tea). This sets the stage for 'eco-diseases'. In a population probably genetically programmed (but modifiably) in utero to abdominal obesity, diabetes (type II and gestational) and cardiovascular disease, these conditions may be rapidly acquired on migration, along with certain cancers (breast, colo-rectal and prostate). Thus, whilst Asian migration to Australia has provided health opportunities for host citizens, there have been threats to migrant citizens in regard to nutrition-related health.

TI The role of nonpharmaceutic conservative interventions in the treatment and secondary prevention of epilepsy.
AU Wolf, Peter
SO Epilepsia
VL 43 Suppl 9
PS 2-5
PY 2002
PD 2002 
AB Nonpharmacologic conservative treatments receive too little attention. Depending on the clinical condition of the patients, they may be used alone or in conjunction with other therapies. Their target is the single seizure rather than the epileptic condition as such. They belong mainly to one of three domains. NONSPECIFIC PREVENTION OF SEIZURES: The first step is the identification of factors facilitating the occurrence of seizures. In the second step, strategies to control these factors are developed. Most common are disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, especially reduction of sleep. Patients should follow a regular sleep schedule with deviations of not >2 h. Sometimes a sleep calendar is helpful. Night shifts are not compatible with seizure prevention in these cases. Sleep disturbances as a facilitating factor of seizures are particularly common in juvenile idiopathic generalized epilepsies, in which their avoidance is in many cases an indispensable part of the therapeutic regimen, along with appropriate drug treatment. They are the most common precipitating factor in adolescents and adults with a first epileptic [mostly generalized tonic-clonic (GTC)] seizure. In these instances, their avoidance is central to the secondary prevention of epilepsy developing from the single seizure, whereas the prescription of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is rarely effective. Other nonspecific facilitators of seizures include uncontrolled use of alcohol and extraordinary stress. Patients must learn how to cope with stressful events. SPECIFIC PREVENTION OF SEIZURES: In reflex epilepsies, specific precipitants of seizures are the targets of interventions. Thus, most patients with primary reading epilepsy begin to have, with prolonged reading, perioral reflex myoclonias, which enable them to stop reading and thus to avoid a GTC seizure. In photosensitive patients, seizures are often precipitated by television. These can be avoided by viewing from a distance and using a remote control, small screens in a well-lit room, and preferably with a 100-Hz line shift. Environmental flicker stimulation often comes unexpectedly, and it is advisable that the patients always wear sunglasses in brightly lighted surroundings. Polarized glasses seem to be more protective than plain sunglasses. If the patient has only photically induced seizures, treatment by specific prevention alone may be sufficient, but if spontaneous seizures also occur, drugs must be given in addition. ARREST OF SEIZURES: Focal seizures that develop sufficiently slowly to leave the patient time to react may be interrupted by "countermeasures." These, again, may be nonspecific (acting by relaxation, concentration, or a combination of both) or specific. The latter are individually tailored, based either on spontaneous experiences of the patient or on the anatomy of ictogenesis. Seizure propagation is blocked when a major part of the neurons involved is activated and not recruitable for spread of the epileptic discharge. Seizure arrest rarely is used alone but usually in combination with partially successful pharmacotherapy.

AB Meetings with a group of 150 teenagers from high school, aged 15-18, were held in the Literary Cafe in Bytom. The problems that were discussed included threats of contemporary world such as: alcoholism, smoking, excessive participation in watching TV, video and Internet. During the meeting drawings, graphics arts and poetry enabled informal entering into conversation with young people and encouraged them to express their opinions. At the next meeting, which took place in High School, a survey was carried out in a group of 33 teenagers. The results of the survey showed that young people assign 6 hours 30 min. on average for rest at night, 3 hours 20 min. on average for watching TV, 2 hours 45 min. for computer, 2 hours 30 min for Internet, 1 hour 30 min for video. 12 out of 27 teenagers are mentally and physically tired after school, 15 teenagers have a rest after school, 18 teenagers fell ill during the school year and answered that they are nervous. 6 answered that they are sometimes nervous. 17 young people like alcohol and tried have it and 6 were drunk up. 14 teenagers like commercials on TV and 19 do not like them 27 children do not belong to any organisations. 12 teenagers have smoked cigarettes and 9 rarely have smoked cigarettes. 1 teenager has taken drugs. American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Public Education describes the possible negative health effects of television viewing on children and adolescents, such as violent or aggressive behavior, substance use, sexual activity, obesity, poor body image, and decreased school performance. In addition to the television ratings system and the v-chip (electronic device to block programming), media education is an effective approach to mitigate these potential problems. The European Society of Social Paediatrics (ESSOP) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers a list of recommendations on this issue for pediatricians and for parents, the federal government, and entertainment industry.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine demographic, behavioral and dietary correlates of frequency of fast food restaurant use in a community-based sample of 4746 adolescent students.; DESIGN: A survey was administered to students in classrooms at 31 secondary schools in a large metropolitan area in Minnesota, United States. Height and body weight were measured.; SUBJECTS: Students in grades 7-12 who were enrolled in participating schools, had parental consent and were in attendance on the day of data collection.; MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of fast food restaurant use (FFFRU), dietary intake, and demographic and behavioral measures were self-reported. Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Height and body weight were directly measured.; RESULTS: FFFRU was positively associated with intake of total energy, percent energy from fat, daily servings of soft drinks, cheeseburgers, french fries and pizza, and was inversely associated with daily servings of fruit, vegetables and milk. FFFRU was positively associated with student employment, television viewing, home availability of unhealthy foods, and perceived barriers to healthy eating, and was inversely associated with students' own and perceived maternal and peer concerns about healthy eating. FFFRU was not associated with overweight status.; CONCLUSIONS: FFFRU is associated with higher energy and fat intake among adolescents. Interventions to reduce reliance on fast food restaurants may need to address perceived importance of healthy eating as well as time and convenience barriers.

AB Drug addictions are often viewed as compulsive behaviors, not sensitive to the typical rules of self-discipline or market forces. Nonetheless, many governments try to discourage consumption of addictive substances through macro policy tools, such as taxation, regulation and prohibition, in an effort to reduce the harmful consequences that result from their consumption. The government's ability to discourage this type of behavior through these macro policies depends critically on the responsiveness of addictive consumption to market interventions. This paper reviews the growing literature that applies economic principles to the analysis of "substance abuse." Specifically, we review the impact of prices and public policies on the demands for tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The findings from these studies clearly demonstrate that even addictive behaviors are sensitive to changes in the price of substances being abused. When the full price of the addictive good rises, consumption of that good falls, even among abusers. Therefore, public policies that raise the full price of a drug to a consumer, particularly youth, are likely to result in long run reductions in rates of addiction.

AB Community activists in Chicago believed their neighborhoods were being targeted by alcohol and tobacco outdoor advertisers, despite the Outdoor Advertising Association of America's voluntary code of principles, which claims to restrict the placement of ads for age-restricted products and prevent billboard saturation of urban neighborhoods. A research and action plan resulted from a 10-year collaborative partnership among Loyola University Chicago, the American Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago (ALAMC), and community activists from a predominately African American church, St. Sabina Parish. In 1997 Loyola University and ALAMC researchers conducted a cross-sectional prevalence survey of alcohol and tobacco outdoor advertising. Computer mapping was used to locate all 4,247 licensed billboards in Chicago that were within 500- and 1,000-foot radiuses of schools, parks, and playlots. A 50% sample of billboards was visually surveyed and coded for advertising content. The percentage of alcohol and tobacco billboards within the 500- and 1,000-foot zones ranged from 0% to 54%. African American and Hispanic neighborhoods were disproportionately targeted for outdoor advertising of alcohol and tobacco. Data were used to convince the Chicago City Council to pass one of the nation's toughest anti-alcohol and tobacco billboard ordinances, based on zoning rather than advertising content. The ordinance was challenged in court by advertisers. Recent Supreme Court rulings made enactment of local billboard ordinances problematic. Nevertheless, the research, which resulted in specific legislative action, demonstrated the importance of linkages among academic, practice, and grassroots community groups in working together to diminish one of the social causes of health disparities.

AB Marketplace practices are integral to the larger economic and social context of adolescent health risk behaviors. To corporations and marketers, adolescents represent a gold mine of current and future profits. Adolescent incomes increased by almost a third in the 1990s. The annual spending of the U.S. adolescent population is estimated now to have reached 155 billion US dollars. The sheer size of the adolescent population and its spending power are of keen interest to corporations and marketers. This chapter presents a brief history of youth-targeted marketing and examines the major avenues in the media and inside schools that marketers and corporations use today to reach adolescents with their messages and products. It outlines the impact of consumerism and marketing on adolescent health using five case examples: tobacco, alcohol, cosmetic surgery, laxatives, and diet pills. It then concludes with a discussion of resistance efforts, led by health advocates, policy makers, parents, and youth themselves to restrict sales of harmful products to youth and curtail advertisers' access to adolescents in schools. A critical role for adolescent health researchers and advocates is to contribute a public health perspective into ongoing debates over regulating business practices that negatively affect the health of young people.

AB AIMS: Genotype-environment correlation refers to the extent to which individuals are exposed to environments as a function of their genetic propensities. These correlations are important in the study of psychopathology because they identify environments that may maintain the expression of underlying genetic liabilities for a disorder. The present study examined the correlation between genetic liabilities for alcohol and drug misuse with perceptions of the social environments of the family of origin and the classroom.; DESIGN: Postal survey data were collected from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.; SETTING: Twin pairs were recruited from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada using newspaper advertisements and media stories.; PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five monozygotic and 77 dizygotic twin pairs were recruited from the general population.; MEASUREMENTS: Twin pairs completed self-report measures of alcohol and drug misuse contained in the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology, the Family Environment Scale, the Classroom Environment Scale, and the Traumatic Events Questionnaire.; FINDINGS: Genetically indexed alcohol and drug misuse scores were regressed on the environmentally indexed FES and CES scales. Genetic liabilities for alcohol and drug misuse were associated with decreased perceived family moral-religious emphases, family cohesion and classroom task orientation and increased perceptions of classroom order and organization (strictness).; CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-environment correlations, in particular, moral-religious emphases in the home, appear to be important in the development of substance misuse.

AB In order to conduct a comparative risk analysis for alcohol within the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2000), several questions had to be answered. (1) What are the appropriate dimensions for alcohol consumption and how can they be categorized? The average volume of alcohol and patterns of drinking were selected as dimensions. Both dimensions could be looked upon as continuous but were categorized for practical purposes. The average volume of drinking was categorized into the following categories: abstention; drinking 1 (> 0-19.99 g pure alcohol daily for females, > 0-39.99 g for males); drinking 2 (20-39.99 g for females, 40-59.99 g for males), and drinking 3 (> or =40 g for females, > or =60 g for males). Patterns of drinking were categorized into four levels of detrimental impact based on an optimal scaling analysis of key informant ratings. (2) What is the theoretical minimum for both dimensions? A pattern of regular light drinking (at most 1 drink every day) was selected as theoretical minimum for established market economies for all people above age 45. For all other regions and age groups, the theoretical minimum was set to zero. Potential problems and uncertainties with this selection are discussed. (3) What are the health outcomes for alcohol and how do they relate to the dimensions? Overall, more than 60 disease conditions were identified as being related to alcohol consumption. Most chronic conditions seem to be related to volume only (exceptions are coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke), and most acute conditions seem to be related to volume and patterns. In addition, using methodology based on aggregate data, patterns were relevant for attributing harms for men but not women.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the burden of mortality in young people (age 15-29) in established market economies in Europe in 1999, which is attributable to alcohol consumption. Two dimensions of alcohol consumption were considered: average volume of consumption, and patterns of drinking.; METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the WHO EIP data bank, average volume data from the WHO global databank on alcohol, pattern of drinking data from a questionnaire sent out to experts, from the published literature and from the WHO global databank. Methods are explained and discussed in detail in two other contributions to this volume.; RESULTS: More than 8,000 deaths of people aged 15-29 in Europe in 1999 were attributable to alcohol. Young males show a higher proportion of alcohol-attributable deaths (12.8%) than females (8.3%). Both average volume and patterns of drinking contribute to alcohol-related death.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-related deaths constitute a considerable burden in young people in Europe.

AB This investigation assessed the relative influence of peer norms and parental involvement on adolescent cigarette and alcohol use. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to 2,017 seventh- to 12th-grade students in two Ohio public school districts. Cigarette and alcohol use rates in the sample were comparable to those found in national probability surveys. Results indicated that the relative balance of peer-parent influences did not differ across grade level. At all grade levels, perceived peer norms had substantially greater correlations with cigarette and alcohol use than did measures of perceived parental involvement. The findings are interpreted from an efficiency perspective. Optimal use of prevention resources suggest that programming for seventh- to 12th-graders should focus on shaping the perceptions of peer smoking and drinking practices rather than on parent interventions. Social norms marketing or other forms of normative education should be tested in this population.

AB BACKGROUND: Variation in the characteristics of irritable bowel syndrome patients recruited for clinical trials from different sources could affect their response and the generalizability of trial results.; AIM: To describe and compare the characteristics of three different groups of irritable bowel syndrome patients recruited into a 'mock clinical trial.'; METHODS: We enrolled 245 irritable bowel syndrome patients from three sources: (i) 121 from British primary practitioners; (ii) 72 from California newspaper advertisements; and (iii) 52 from a California gastroenterologist's practice. We obtained demographic, clinical, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale data.; RESULTS: Most patients were young to middle-aged women; the majority reported symptoms for > 5 years in all three groups. Subject characteristics varied among the groups. Typically, primary care patients were anxious, smokers and daily alcohol drinkers who had sought care recently for irritable bowel syndrome and tried antispasmodic drugs. Their symptoms were intermediate in severity between those of the other two groups. Advertisement subjects were the oldest, most highly educated, most often depressed, and were least likely to have sought care recently for symptoms, which were almost uniformly only moderate in severity. Gastroenterologist patients tended to be anxious and had nearly all sought care recently for symptoms, which were the most severe and most likely to include all three pain-related Rome I criteria.; CONCLUSION: Recruitment methodology affects important characteristics of an irritable bowel syndrome study group.

Advertising of alcohol in the media, on the Internet, and during sporting events is a powerful force that must be addressed. Availability of alcohol to minors must be controlled, and interventions for the child and adolescent drinker and punitive action for the purveyor are encouraged.

AB OBJECTIVE: This article examines the relationship between prior problem behaviors and change in residence on alcohol use patterns among college students.; METHOD: Measures of alcohol consumption (e.g., drinking frequency, average consumption and frequency of heavy episodic drinking were related to residence patterns and prior problem behaviors (e.g., conduct problems. illicit substance involvement and early age at onset of alcohol consumption). Subjects (N = 2,465; 51% women) were a subsample drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Labor Market Experience in Youth. The analysis was conducted using a linear growth model for continuous outcomes with time-invariant and time-varying covariates for each of the drinking measures.; RESULTS: The results of the structural equation analysis yielded significant and direct effects related to residence patterns and prior problem behaviors. Problem behaviors were related to drinking measures; however, there was no evidence for a mediational hypothesis. Neither was there systematic evidence that the relationship between prior problem behavior and alcohol use was mediated by residence patterns. The analysis of change in residence was related to both time-specific and longer-term influences on alcohol use.; CONCLUSIONS: The presence of direct and independent effects for both dispositional and high-risk environmental factors in collegiate drinking practices support targeted and diverse strategies for prevention activities.

AB A social marketing campaign to change perceptions of peer drinking norms was conducted by the National Golden Key Honor Society at the University of Mississippi during the 1995-1996 school year. To assess the campaign's impact on perceptions of student drinking norms and alcohol consumption, Golden Key's national office administered a survey three times during the school year to all students enrolled in a random sample of required freshmen English courses. Regression analyses suggest that exposure to the marketing campaign may be associated with lower (and more accurate) estimates of student drinking norms. While offering promising results, this study was limited due to shortcomings in the research design. Future evaluations of social norms marketing campaigns should adhere to basic evaluation principles, such as using comparison groups, collecting contextual data, using a valid and reliable survey instrument, and ensuring proper survey administration techniques.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess young people's perceived messages in three ads for a vodka-based, pre-mixed alcohol beverage, and to assess the extent to which the ads appeared to be consistent with the industry's voluntary code.; METHOD: Members of two convenience samples of young people (15-16 and 19-21 years) were each exposed to one of three advertisements. Respondents completed a post exposure questionnaire based on standard advertising copy testing procedures.; RESULTS: The most frequently nominated open-ended responses to 'the main message(s) of the ad' related to the product delivering mood effects: both removal of negative emotions (e.g. 'stress reduction'), as well as inducing positive states such as feeling 'carefree' and gaining 'increased enjoyment'. Consumption of the product was perceived to offer 'self-confidence', 'sexual/relationship success' and 'social success'. Fewer respondents nominated tangible product characteristics, the main one being 'easy to drink'. One in four of the 15-16 year olds saw the ads as aimed at 'people my age', while almost half of the 19-21 year olds saw the ads as aimed at 'people younger or much younger than me'.; DISCUSSION: These results appear to contravene the Alcoholic Beverages Advertising Code (ABAC) by suggesting that the consumption of alcohol beverages: (i) contributes to social and sexual success; and (ii) contributes to a significant change in mood (stress reduction/relaxation).; IMPLICATIONS: Incidental observation of alcohol ads suggests that contravention of the code is more widespread than the number of alcohol advertising complaints would indicate. All 11 such complaints lodged with the Advertising Standards Board between May 1998 and April 1999 were dismissed. Evidence such as that gathered in this study might improve the chances of complaints being upheld.

Media research since has focused on content and viewing patterns.; CONCLUSIONS: The primary effects of media exposure are increased violent and aggressive behavior, increased high-risk behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco use, and accelerated onset of sexual activity. The newer forms of media have not been adequately studied, but concern is warranted through the logical extension of earlier research on other media forms and the amount of time the average child spends with increasingly sophisticated media.

AB In Scotland during the mid 1990s the news media began reporting growing concern about a new form of alcoholic beverage known as 'alcopops'. Fears raised by the press centred on the claim that these drinks were being marketed towards young children and as such were responsible for the rising levels of adolescent drunkenness. In focusing on underage consumption and alleged marketing aimed at children, the press portrayed alcopops use as illicit, allowing these drinks to be reported as if they were an illegal drug. This 'negative' publicity was in contrast to the 'positive' stories and advertising space given over to other alcoholic beverages elsewhere in their pages. This manuscript quantifies the volume of reporting of these drinks in the Scottish press over the life-span of their news-worthiness. It argues that the press's claims could not be supported by the realities of underage drinking at the time. When this became apparent the scare story ended as rapidly as it had begun. Though concerning a licit substance these findings were found to have many illuminating parallels with illegal drug scare stories.

AB OBJECTIVE: This article examines the factor structure of 22 symptom items used to configure the criteria of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) alcohol abuse and dependence and relates the factor structure to background characteristics.; METHOD: Data for this study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Labor Market Experience in Youth (NLSY). The symptom items were related to the covariates using the statistical technique of structural equation modeling generalized to dichotomous outcomes. The present model is a special case of structural equation modeling, a multiple causes and multiple indicators (MIMIC) model, in which one or more latent variables (i.e., alcohol abuse and dependence) intervene between a set of observed background variables predicting a set of observed response variables (i.e., DSM-IV symptom items).; RESULTS: The results of the structural equation analysis provide further support for two dimensions underlying the DSM-IV symptom items. Although the two-factor dimension bore a strong resemblance to the DSM-IV conceptions of abuse and dependence, there were notable differences in the item content of the symptom items for each dimension. The dependence dimension drew upon items related to the abuse criteria for continued drinking despite social problems and recurrent drinking resulting in failure to fulfill role obligations. The abuse dimension drew upon items related to the abuse criterion for hazardous drinking and the dependence criterion for larger amounts over time. The two factors were shown to have different relationships to the background variables. Alcohol dependence was related to family history of alcoholism and educational status. Age was not related to dependence and inversely related to alcohol abuse.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study replicate the two-dimensional model for DSM-IV criteria found in other studies and provide further support for the validity of alcohol dependence in general population samples. A major implication of the factor structure in the present study relates to the different classification of cases that would otherwise be obtained with DSM-IV criteria. These departures were shown to affect abuse, which retained only 40% of DSM-IV diagnoses, more strongly than dependence, which retained 91% of DSM-IV diagnoses.

AB Public health social marketing campaigns have targeted adults to prevent drinking and driving, smoking, and human immunodeficiency virus transmission; however, adults have not been targeted for prevention of child sexual abuse. In Vermont, STOP IT NOW! addresses child sexual abuse systematically as a public health issue by using social marketing and public education to emphasize the responsibility of adults for prevention. As one component of STOP IT NOW!, Vermont sex offender treatment providers and state attorneys' offices were surveyed in September 1997 to assess self-reported abuse by adults and adolescents. This report summarizes the results of the survey, which indicate that some adults who abuse will turn themselves in voluntarily for treatment despite mandated reporting to the legal system, and some parents will intervene to seek help for their children who have sexual behavior problems even without a victim's report. Continued studies are needed to evaluate this approach to preventing child sexual abuse.

AB The quantity, frequency, and variability of alcohol and other substance use is described in a random sample of 1,436 enrolled members of four tribes from the northern United States. Overall, males begin regular drinking at an earlier age than do females (17 vs. 18.1 years), and more males drink alcohol than females (70.7% to 60.4%). There are some very heavy drinkers who drink daily in these populations, but most drinkers are binge drinkers. On any typical day abstinence from alcohol is the modal pattern. That is, most respondents indicated very infrequent drinking, and among the older age groups (40+), there is a high rate of abstinence. Males drink more frequently and in larger quantities than females. The number of drinking days per month is 4.7 for males and 2.1 for females, and on those days when drinking occurs, the males consume an average of 5.7 drinks and females an average of 3.1. The highest prevalence of drinking and the heaviest drinking occur among those who are under the age of 30. With the exception of tobacco use, which is high in all age categories, the use of other drugs is highest in those under 30.

The Core Alcohol and Drug Survey and the Health Enhancement Survey provided information on student knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors regarding alcohol and binge drinking. This study represents the first in-depth research on the impact of a media approach, based on a normative social influence model, to reduce binge drinking on a large university campus and has yielded promising initial results.

AB In this Monograph, we report the follow-up of 570 adolescents who had been studied as preschoolers in one of two separate investigations of television use. The primary goal of the study was to determine the long-term relations between preschool television viewing and adolescent achievement, behavior, and attitudes. Using a telephone interview and high school transcripts, we assessed adolescent media use; grades in English, science, and math; leisure reading; creativity; aggression; participation in extracurricular activities; use of alcohol and cigarettes; and self-image. In each domain, we tested theories emphasizing the causal role of television content (e.g., social learning, information processing) as contrasted with those theories positing effects of television as a medium, irrespective of content (e.g., time displacement, pacing, interference with language). The results provided much stronger support for content-based hypotheses than for theories emphasizing television as a medium; moreover, the patterns differed for boys and girls. Viewing educational programs as preschoolers was associated with higher grades, reading more books, placing more value on achievement, greater creativity, and less aggression. These associations were more consistent for boys than for girls. By contrast, the girls who were more frequent preschool viewers of violent programs had lower grades than those who were infrequent viewers. These associations held true after taking into account family background, other categories of preschool viewing, and adolescent media use. One hypothesis accounting for the sex differences is that early experiences, such as television viewing, have greater effects when they counteract normative developmental trends and predominant sex-typed socialization influences than when they reinforce them. Adolescents in the study used both television and print media to support ongoing interests. Television content (e.g., entertainment, sports, or world events) predicted extracurricular activities, role models, and body image. The only evidence for possible effects of television as a medium was the positive relation of total viewing to obesity for girls. The medium of television is not homogeneous or monolithic, and content viewed is more important than raw amount. The medium is not the message: The message is.

AB This paper focuses on the marketing of alcohol to young people in the United Kingdom, but the lessons that emerge have international significance. Alcohol is a global enterprise and recent consolidation means that it is controlled by a decreasing number of expanding multi-nationals. Alcohol companies are able to allocate significant resources to researching consumer preferences, developing new products and promoting them on an international level. Recent years have seen a growth in the value that youth culture attaches to brand labels and symbols and a move away from the healthy-living ethos. The alcohol industry's response to these trends has been to design alcoholic beverages that appeal to young people, using well-informed and precisely targeted marketing strategies. This has led to growing concerns about the implications for public health and a demand for tighter controls to regulate alcohol marketing practices. In the United Kingdom, controls on alcohol are piecemeal and reactive and the current system of voluntary regulation appears ineffective. This paper argues for more research to establish current industry practice and inform the development of a comprehensive regulatory structure and system of monitoring.

AB This paper describes the introduction of alcopops and sweet ciders in Sweden in 1996, as a result of the membership of the European Union. Special attention is given to its effect on youth drinking. Surveys of young people show that alcopops and sweet ciders are perceived to be easy to drink and to have a sweet and pleasant taste, which tends to conceal the taste of alcohol. These results suggest that alcopops and sweet ciders should be regarded as one category of drinks. Alcopops and sweet ciders have penetrated the youth market rapidly. The introduction of these beverages accounted for approximately half of the increase in alcohol consumption by 15-16-year-old boys from 1996 to 1999, and two-thirds of the increase among girls, according to the surveys. A large proportion of the youth answered that alcopops and ciders did not replace any other alcoholic beverage. The paper also describes the public debate on alcopops and cider. The introduction of alcopops was criticized by the media and the responsible minister. Prominent spokesmen of the alcohol industry put themselves at a distance from these, primarily imported, products. The sales of alcopops have been declining since 1997. Sweet ciders, on the other hand, which in reality are synonymous with alcopops, have continued to increase during the whole period since 1996, and have not been subject to the same public criticism.

AB OBJECTIVE: We present baseline sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence rates from an ongoing intervention trial at Kenyan agricultural sites.; METHODS: After gaining the cooperation of management, we identified six matched pairs of tea, coffee, and flower plantations and enrolled approximately 160 women at each site. Six intervention sites received an information programme and distributed female and male condoms, while six control sites received male condoms only and similar information about them. At clinic visits, we tested participants for cervical gonorrhoea (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) by ligase chain reaction on urine specimens, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) by culture. The study has 80% power to detect a 10% prevalence difference during follow up, assuming a combined STD prevalence of 20%, 25% loss to follow up and intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03.; RESULTS: Participants at intervention and control sites (total 1929) were similar at baseline. Mean age was 33 years, the majority were married, more than half currently used family planning, 78% had never used male condoms, and 9% reported more than one sexual partner in the 3 months before the study. Prevalences of GC, CT, and TV were 2.6%, 3.2%, and 20.4% respectively (23.9% overall), and were similar at intervention and control sites. The ICC for STD prevalence was 0.0011. Baseline STD was associated with unmarried status, non-use of family planning, alcohol use, and more than one recent sexual partner, but the highest odds ratio was 1.5.; CONCLUSIONS: Baseline results confirm a high prevalence of trichomoniasis and bacterial STD at these Kenyan rural sites. Improved STD management is urgently needed there. Our ongoing female condom intervention trial is feasible as designed.

AB The Great Patent Medicine Era (1865-1907) was the golden age of secret remedies--quack, non-prescription medicinal products, sold over-the-counter. Making outrageous and unsubstantiated claims, the makers of dental nostrums purported to effectively treat stained teeth, bad breath, diseased gums, toothache and teething discomfort. No proof was required to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of these concoctions. Advertisements for patent medicines were widespread, appearing in newspapers, almanacs, magazines, trade cards and multiple other media forms. Many dental patent medicines contained acids, abrasive substances, alcohol and/or narcotics, such as heroin, cocaine and morphine. Sozodont Tooth Powder, the most widely promoted and successful dentifrice of this era, claimed to "harden and invigorate the gums, purify and perfume the breath and beautify and preserve the teeth from youth to old age." Early dental researchers found that this remedy contained harsh ingredients (such as acid, sharp abrasives and astringents) which could destroy tooth substance. Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, an extremely popular dental nostrum, was intended to quiet a fretful child during the teething process. However, it contained generous levels of alcohol and morphine sulfate which could cause coma, addiction or death in an infant. Although somewhat chemically altered, these two products were eventually removed from the market in the 1930s.

AB Health-related lifestyles (smoking, drinking alcohol, exercise and diet) and feelings of alienation (powerlessness and hopelessness) of the citizens of Helsinki and Moscow are examined and discussed in a framework of life chances and life choices. The data were collected by a postal survey of 18-64 yr old citizens of Helsinki (N = 824) and Moscow (N = 545) in 1991. Almost all respondents in both cities used alcohol, but heavy drinking was more frequently reported in Helsinki. Muscovite men were smokers more often and Muscovite women less often than their counterparts in Helsinki. Nearly half of the Muscovites, but less than one-fifth of the Helsinki respondents considered their diet unhealthy or of poor quality. Regular exercise was much more common among the Finns compared to the Muscovites. The sex difference in health-related lifestyles was wider in Moscow than in Helsinki, especially concerning health-damaging behaviour. Feelings of alienation were more pronounced in Moscow. In both cities alienation was more clearly associated with socioeconomic life chance factors than with lifestyle factors. In Helsinki feelings of alienation had stronger associations both with health and health related lifestyles, which possibly points to a conventional stratification effect of a market-based class society. In Moscow, which represents a more traditional community, alienation seemed to be part of a widely felt general discontent. Health was a highly salient value in both cities, especially among women. In Helsinki a high valuation of health was connected with less smoking, more exercise and a healthier diet. Valuing health did not seem to emerge as a distinct healthy lifestyle in Moscow where behavioural choices were limited by many material constraints.

AB In an earlier paper, the author identified the role of maternal social characteristics on child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa through statistical analysis (Iyun, 1992; GeoJournal, 26(1), 43-52). This follow-up analysis attempts to further analyze and determine the relative significance of environmental and maternal factors on childhood mortality in two contrasting towns in southwestern Nigeria. The research design takes advantage of the integration of the medical and social sciences. The results of the current analysis reveal interesting insights into child mortality and maternal factors on one hand and domestic environmental conditions on the other. They give credence to an ecological perspective as a way to understand the complexities behind child survival. Domestic environmental conditions were stronger predictors of child mortality in the more developed study town, Ota, than the more traditional town, Iseyin. However, in both sites maternal factors, in particular age of mother at marriage, age of mother at first childbirth and parity were statistically significant predictors of child mortality. Mother's education was only significant in the more urbanized center, and generally remains inconsistent in its relationship with child mortality. Furthermore, child mortality rates continued to be a function of an environmental factor, namely source of drinking water, and a child care behavior factor, where the child was kept when mother was at work, especially the market environment.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between patterns of behaviour, body composition and diet in adolescent girls. A group of 328 14 to 16-year-old girls at school in Southampton, U. K. completed a questionnaire about their behaviour and lifestyle, and had their heights, weights and skinfold thicknesses measured. Of these girls, 286 also provided dietary information. Socially independent girls were more likely to smoke, and less likely to eat breakfast and meals with family. They consumed more snacks, chocolate and soft drinks. Girls who were dissatisfied with their weight dieted and exercised, watched less television and spent less of their money on food. Dissatisfaction with weight was strongly related to body mass index. The odds of being a dieter, an indication of dissatisfaction with weight, increased with every unit increase in body mass index, so that girls with a body mass index of 24 kg/m(2)and over were 19 times more likely to diet than those with a body mass index of 19 kg/m(2)or less. Girls who were less satisfied with their weight reported lower energy intakes but ate more green vegetables and brown bread than other girls. The eating habits of the girls were therefore influenced by the extent of their social lives and by their satisfaction with their weight. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

AB BACKGROUND: Examining life expectancy and general mortality rates, the health of the population of Geneva can be described as one of the best in the world. However, in some areas Geneva fares worse than the rest of Switzerland or Europe. To re-appraise the current health priorities of the Genevan population, we analysed the relative importance of specific diseases and injuries calculating DALYs.; METHODS: We followed the procedures developed for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to ensure comparability. Some adaptations were made for mortality coding. Disability was estimated based on data for countries classified as Established Market Economies (EME) in the GBD study.; RESULTS: Non-communicable diseases accounted for 79% of the disability adjusted life years (DALY), injuries represented 12%, and communicable diseases and other disorders 9%. Ischaemic heart disease was the largest single contributor to DALY, followed by unipolar major depression. Neuropsychiatric disorders and mental health accounted for more than 23% of DALY.; CONCLUSIONS: Some of the most important problems identified-depression, osteoarthritis and alcohol abuse-would have been overlooked in an analysis based solely on mortality data. The most striking finding is the importance of mental health problems. The main limitation is the lack of morbidity data for Geneva.

AB CONTEXT: Adults aged 18 to 24 years, many of whom are in college, represent the youngest legal targets for tobacco industry marketing. Cigarette smoking has been described among college students, but little is known about non-cigarette tobacco use by college students or cigar use by adults of any age.; OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of all forms of tobacco use (cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco) among US college students and to identify student- and college-level factors associated with use of each product.; DESIGN: The Harvard College Alcohol Survey, a self-administered survey conducted in 1999.; SETTING: One hundred nineteen nationally representative US 4-year colleges.; SUBJECTS: A total of 14,138 randomly selected students (60% response rate).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report of current (in the past 30 days), past-year, and lifetime use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and all tobacco products.; RESULTS: Nearly half (45.7%) of respondents had used a tobacco product in the past year and one third (32.9%) currently used tobacco. Cigarettes accounted for most of the tobacco use (28.5% current prevalence), but cigar use was also substantial (37.1% lifetime prevalence, 23.0% past-year prevalence, and 8.5% current prevalence) and combinations of the 2 were common. Total tobacco use was higher in men than in women (37. 9% vs 29.7%; P<.001), despite nearly identical current cigarette smoking rates between the sexes (28.5% for women vs 28.4% for men), because of greater use of cigars (current prevalence, 15.7% vs 3.9%; P<.001) and smokeless tobacco (current prevalence, 8.7% vs 0.4%; P<. 001) by men. Tobacco use was significantly higher among white students (P<.001), users of other substances (alcohol and marijuana) (P<.001), and students whose priorities were social rather than educational or athletic (P<.05). Among students who had used both cigars and cigarettes, only 8.9% smoked cigars at an earlier age than they had smoked cigarettes.; CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that tobacco use is common among college students and is not limited to cigarettes. College appears to be a time when many students are trying a range of tobacco products and are in danger of developing lifelong nicotine dependence. National efforts to monitor and reduce tobacco use of all types should expand to focus on college students and other young adults. JAMA. 2000;284:699-705

AB BACKGROUND: Disinhibited, antisocial traits increase the risk for early-onset alcoholism. Research also suggests that decision biases which favor immediate large rewards regardless of long-term consequences may be important mechanisms associated with the biological substrates of antisocial traits. This study tested the hypothesis that early-onset alcoholism with antisocial personality (ASP) would be associated with favoring immediate larger rewards despite their being associated with long-term losses.; METHODS: Twenty-seven early-onset alcoholics with and without a diagnosis of ASP, eight subjects with ASP but no alcohol dependence, and 32 controls were tested on a task that manipulated the magnitude of immediate rewards and the magnitude of long-term punishments. The sample was recruited from the community via advertisements.; RESULTS: Compared with subjects without ASP, subjects with ASP favored larger immediate rewards despite long-term losses regardless of alcohol dependence; however, they learned to shift their decisions in a more advantageous direction over time. A disadvantageous decision bias also was associated with drinking greater quantities of alcohol and having a lower IQ.; CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that ASP in a young adult noninstitutionalized sample was associated with a pattern of disadvantageous decision making similar to that observed in patients with antisocial behavioral characteristics associated with lesions in the ventromedial frontal cortex. The data also suggest that this pattern of disadvantageous decision making is associated with consuming larger quantities of alcohol but not consuming alcohol more frequently.

AB To document knowledge and attitudes regarding sexuality and sexual practices of male adolescent high school students in Lima, Peru, a self-administered, anonymous survey was completed by 991 male adolescents aged 12-19 as part of a School-Based Sex Education Intervention model. Questions concerned sociodemographic information; family characteristics; personal activities; knowledge and attitudes regarding sexuality; sexual experience; and contraceptive use. Knowledge related to sexuality was limited. Males tended to mainly discuss sexuality with their male peers (49.8%). Attitudes towards sexual activity and condom use were largely positive, although some males expressed ambivalent feelings towards the latter. Of the sample, 43% had ever had sex; age at first sexual intercourse was 13 years. While 88% of the sample would use condoms, 74% also gave reasons for not using them. Sexual activity was related to age, ever having repeated a grade, living with only one parent or in a mixed family, activities such as going to parties, use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, and viewing pornographic videos or magazines. Many male adolescents were at risk of causing an unintended pregnancy or acquiring an STD.

AB OBJECTIVES: (i) To assess the severity of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), (ii) to determine the aetiology of IDD in Gujarat, (iii) to identify the best prevalence indicator of IDD, and (iv) to compare thyroid volume (TV) results with the WHO International reference.; METHODS: Five hundred and thirty schoolchildren (6-15 years) were studied from two districts (Baroda and Dang) and data were collected on dietary habits and parameters such as height, weight, thyroid size by palpation and ultrasonography, urinary iodine (UI), and blood thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Drinking water was analyzed for iodine content and food articles for goitrogens.; RESULTS: In Gujarat children median UI (interquartile range)=56 (30-96)microg/l, mean TSH=1.71 +/- 2.10mU/l, goiter by palpatio n = 30%, and median TV = 27.8 (23-35)ml. Females had lower median UI (48 (27-82) microg/l) and higher mean TSH levels (2.0 +/- 2.5mU/l) than males. Applying the WHO ultrasonography reference to Gujarat children resulted in an enlarged TV-for-body surface area in almost 100% of subjects. Ninety-nine percent of females and 95% of males had enlarged TV-for-age. Three to eight times larger TV were seen in all subjects as compared with European children. Dang children were severely malnourished. Flavonoids like vitexin, glucosyl vitexin and apigenin were detected in pearl millet. Apigenin was never identified in pearl millet. Dang district water was lacking in iodine content.; CONCLUSIONS: IDD is a severe public health problem in Gujarat. Baroda district is a new pocket of IDD. High amounts of dietary flavonoids in Baroda and Dang districts, and lack of iodine in Dang water, account for IDD. TV measurement by ultrasound is the best prevalence indicator of IDD.

AB Healthy People 2010 objectives call for meals and snacks served in schools to contribute to overall diets that meet federal dietary guidelines. Sales in schools of foods and drinks high in calories and low in nutrients undermine this health objective, as well as participation in the more nutritious, federally sponsored, school lunch programs. Competitive foods also undermine nutrition information taught in the classroom. Lucrative contracts between school districts and soft drink companies for exclusive rights to sell one brand are the latest development in the increasing commercialization of school food. These contracts, intended to elicit brand loyalty among young children who have a lifetime of purchases ahead of them, are especially questionable because they place schools in the position of "pushing" soft drink consumption. "Pouring rights" contracts deserve attention from public health professionals concerned about the nutritional quality of children's diets.

AB BACKGROUND: An increasing number of the centrally acting muscle relaxants were withdrawn from the Norwegian market during the 1988-98 period. The only drug in this group now marketed in Norway is carisoprodol. The National Institute of Forensic Toxicology in Norway analyses all blood samples from suspected drugged drivers. In later years there has been a marked increase in the number of blood samples testing positive for carisoprodol or meprobamate (the major metabolite).; MATERIAL AND METHODS: 480 cases testing positive for central muscle relaxants in the years 1984-1998 were further studied.; RESULTS: Compared with blood samples positive primarily for benzodiazepines, there were more women in the group (39% vs. 15%), and fewer drugs and less alcohol were detected.; INTERPRETATION: The positive samples may indicate misuse or abuse due to the fact that high drug concentrations and concomitant use of benzodiazepines were frequent. This knowledge should have implications for doctors prescribing centrally acting muscle relaxants.

AB BACKGROUND: The five Nordic countries seem rather homogeneous when assessed from abroad. They do have a lot in common: similar political systems, same standard of living, and even a common language root for a large part of the population. The Nordic countries have collaborated quite closely after the Second World War in fields like the labour market, pension rights and passport control. However, the health status has varied considerably during the twentieth century, even though death rates from some of the most common diseases such as cardiovascular disease are starting to converge.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vital statistics have been compared with regard to some common diseases. The differences are described according to current knowledge on preventive programmes such as breast cancer screening and screening for cardiovascular risk. The prevalence of some lifestyle variables such as alcohol, smoking, physical activity and fat consumption are reported.; RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Lung cancer and cancer of the stomach still show substantial variation between the countries. Both discrepancies and similarities must be related to lifestyle, culture, politics and to some extent genetics. The five countries have their own viewpoints on tobacco, alcohol and nutrition policy, with the Danes the more liberal, and Swedes, Finns and Norwegians pursuing a stricter policy. These differences are to some extent reflected in the incidence of lung cancer, which are more positive in Finland, and the high death rates from liver cirrhosis in Denmark. The relatively unsatisfactory development in Denmark may be a consequence of a much longer period of structural unemployment than the other countries, as well as a more liberal attitude towards alcohol and smoking.

AB AIMS: This study seeks to estimate the extent to which a common genetic and environmental basis is shared between (i) traits delineating specific aspects of antisocial personality and alcohol misuse, and (ii) childhood family environments, traits delineating broad domains of personality pathology and alcohol misuse.; DESIGN: Postal survey data were collected from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.; SETTING: Twin pairs were recruited from Vancouver, British Columbia and London, Ontario, Canada using newspaper advertisements, media stories and twin clubs.; PARTICIPANTS: Data obtained from 324 monozygotic and 335 dizygotic twin pairs were used to estimate the extent to which traits delineating specific antisocial personality traits and alcohol misuse shared a common genetic and environmental aetiology. Data from 81 monozygotic and 74 dizygotic twin pairs were used to estimate the degree to which traits delineating personality pathology, childhood family environment and alcohol misuse shared a common aetiology.; MEASUREMENTS: Current alcohol misuse and personality pathology were measured using scales contained in the self-report Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology. Perceptions of childhood family environment were measured using the self-report Family Environment Scale.; FINDINGS: Multivariate genetic analyses showed that a subset of traits delineating components of antisocial personality (i.e. grandiosity, attention-seeking, failure to adopt social norms, interpersonal violence and juvenile antisocial behaviours) are influenced by genetic factors in common to alcohol misuse. Genetically based perceptions of childhood family environment had little relationship with alcohol misuse.; CONCLUSIONS: Heritable personality factors that influence the perception of childhood family environment play only a small role in the liability to alcohol misuse. Instead, liability to alcohol misuse is related to genetic factors common a specific subset of antisocial personality traits describing conduct problems, narcissistic and stimulus-seeking behaviour.

AB This paper illustrates the application of a Public Health Model toward understanding the nature and extent of alcohol-related problems and, in turn, provides examples of strategies targeted at reducing or preventing alcohol-related illness, injury and death in Wisconsin and Milwaukee County. More specifically, data are provided detailing the widespread use and misuse of alcohol as well as the medical, behavioral and social problems associated with its use. Alcohol use and misuse is the third leading cause of preventable death behind only tobacco use and diet/activity patterns, and therefore, warrants the implementation of prevention strategies from a public health perspective. In sum, the public health model specifies three interrelated factors--the host, the agent or vehicle, and the environment--that focus strategies to reduce and/or prevent illness, injury and death. The paper concludes with specific examples of alcohol-related public health strategies targeting the host (e.g., youth and families, minority groups), the agent/vehicle (e.g., alcohol content, labeling of containers, large containers), and the environment (e.g., motor vehicle operation BAC limits, zero tolerance laws, alcohol advertising).

AB The number of US children who are overweight has more than doubled over the last decade. This change has broadened the focus of dietary guidance for children to address nutrient overconsumption and physical activity patterns. Total fat consumption expressed as a percentage of energy intake has decreased among US children. However, this decrease is largely the result of increased total energy intake in the form of carbohydrates and not necessarily due to decreased fat consumption. The majority of children aged 5-17 years are not meeting recommendations for Ca intakes. Much of this deficit is attributed to changing beverage consumption patterns, characterized by declining milk intakes and substantial increases in soft-drink consumption. On average, US children are not eating the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables. US adolescents become less active as they get older, and one-quarter of all US children watch > or = 4 h television each day, which is positively associated with increased BMI and skinfold thickness. There is an urgent need in the USA for effective prevention strategies aimed at helping children grow up with healthful eating and physical activity habits to achieve optimal health.

Exposure groups included 2,257 individuals from households exposed to untreated wastewater, 2,147 from a group using the effluent from a series of reservoirs, and 2,344 from rain-fed agricultural villages. Stool samples were collected from 6,748 individuals. Wastewater samples were tested for fecal coliforms/100 ml and Giardia sp. cysts/L. Untreated wastewater samples contained 10(8) fecal coliforms/100 ml and up to 300 Giardia sp. cysts/L. Hydraulic retention (3-7 months) in the reservoirs, however, provided an improved effluent quality (10(1)-10(4) fecal coloforms/100 ml and < or = 5 Giardia sp. cysts/L). Children 1-14 years of age had the highest prevalence of infection (20%). Data showed marginal associations between storing drinking water in unprotected containers and lack of facilities for feces disposal and the risk of infection (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.76 and 1.19, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 0.95-3.23, and 0.97-1.45, respectively). Individuals purchasing vegetables at the city market had higher rates of infection than those buying at the village shop (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.00-6.17). No excess risk was found in individuals exposed to untreated wastewater compared with controls (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.84-1.36); the group using reservoir water was not different from the controls (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.94-1.58). No risk from agricultural activities was detected (OR = 0.83). This pattern of infection may be addressed by primary health care and wastewater treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: The process that connects media use with alcohol-related beliefs and behaviors has not been well documented. To address this issue, we examined adolescents' viewing patterns, beliefs about alcohol and media messages, and parental discussion of media messages in the context of a theoretical model of message interpretation processes. Measures included the degree to which adolescents found portrayals desirable, realistic, and similar to their own lives; the degree to which they wanted to be like (identify with) the portrayals; and the degree to which they associated positive outcomes with drinking alcohol (expectancies).; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: Two public high schools in the California central coastal area that include a diverse population in terms of ethnic origin, income level, and education level.; PARTICIPANTS: Ninth-grade students (n = 252) and 12th-grade students (n = 326).; OUTCOME MEASURES: Students reported the number of days within the past week watching various genres of television content, along with perceptions of realism of content, desirability of portrayals, identification with portrayals, expectancies toward alcohol use, personal norms for alcohol use, desire for products with alcohol logos, current alcohol use, frequency of parental reinforcement, and counter-reinforcement of television messages. Associations were examined via hierarchical multiple regression analysis.; RESULTS: Effects of media exposure on drinking behavior, controlling for grade level, ethnicity, gender, household income, and education levels were primarily positive and indirect, operating through a number of intervening beliefs, especially expectancies (beta =.59; r(2) =.33). Direct associations, primarily with exposure to late-night talk shows (beta =.12; r(2) =.01), were small. Parental discussion also affected behavior indirectly, operating through expectancies, identification, and perceived realism. The appeal of products with alcohol logos, which was higher among the younger students (t = 3.44) and predicted by expectancies (beta =. 37; r(2) =.13), sports viewing (beta =.17; r(2) =.03) and late-night talk shows (beta =.10; r(2) =.01), predicted actual drinking behavior (beta =.22; r(2) =.04). Drinking behavior was higher among the older students (t = -2.515).; CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents make drinking decisions using a progressive, logical decision-making process that can be overwhelmed by wishful thinking. The potential risk of frequent exposure to persuasive alcohol portrayals via late-night talk shows, sports, music videos, and prime-time television for underage drinking is moderated by parental reinforcement and counter-reinforcement of messages. Interventions need to acknowledge and counter the appeal of desirable and seemingly realistic alcohol portrayals in the media and alert parents to their potential for unintended adverse effects.

AB The prevalence and costs of alcohol and drug disorders pose a serious social concern for policymakers. In this paper, we use data from the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) to estimate simple descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models of the relationship between symptoms of dependence and labor market outcomes for alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and other illicit drugs. For men, we find that substance use with symptoms of dependence is associated with both lower employment rates and fewer hours of work. For women, we find that substance use with symptoms of dependence is associated with lower employment rates, but we find no consistent evidence of a relationship between symptoms of dependence and the number of hours worked. Finally, all of our point estimates are smaller in magnitude when we control for multiple substance use, suggesting that comorbidities play a critical role in the relationship between substance use and labor market outcomes. Our results suggest that policymakers and researchers should consider the full spectrum of substance use and dependence rather than focusing on the simple use of a single substance.

The final sample consisted of 4,590 high school students of both sexes, aged 14 to 19 years. Data analysis revealed several significant gender differences. Girls more often than boys reported family conflict, personal problems, physical inactivity, attempts to control body weight, use of psychoactive drugs, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Their level of depression was higher and self-esteem lower when compared with their male counterparts. Boys more often than girls indicated that they watched a great deal of television, were the victims of peer violence, and drank alcohol.

AB A survey of 273 children in Washington state used a predrinking behavior index as a behavioral outcome to assess media effects on precursors to drinking among children for whom alcohol consumption is not yet occurring. It also examined age trends in relevant beliefs and behaviors. Perceptions of advertising desirability, the extent to which it seemed appealing, increased steadily from third to ninth grade, whereas identification with portrayals, the degree to which individuals wanted to emulate portrayals, leveled off after sixth grade. Expectancies, positive social benefits perceived to be associated with drinking alcohol, also increased with age, particularly between sixth and ninth grade. When demographics and grade level were controlled, desirability predicted identification, and both predicted expectancies, which is consistent with media decision-making theory. Expectancies correlated with alcohol predrinking behavior, and expectancies predicted risky behavior, with demographics and grade level controlled. Predrinking behavior and reported risky behavior were correlated. The results provide cross-sectional support for the view that beliefs and desires developing by third grade prime children for future decisions regarding substance use.

AB Traditional ways of preventing and treating overweight and obesity have almost invariably focused on changing the behavior of individuals, an approach that has proven woefully inadequate, as indicated by the rising rates of both conditions. Considering the many aspects of American culture that promote obesity, from the proliferation of fast-food outlets to almost universal reliance on automobiles, reversing current trends will require a multifaceted public health policy approach as well as considerable funding. National leadership is needed to ensure the participation of health officials and researchers, educators and legislators, transportation experts and urban planners, and businesses and nonprofit groups in formulating a public health campaign with a better chance of success. The authors outline a broad range of policy recommendations and suggest that an obesity prevention campaign might be funded, in part, with revenues from small taxes on selected products that provide "empty" calories-such as soft drinks-or that reduce physical activity-such as automobiles.

AB OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the profile of clients as reported by 186 male sex workers in three Australian cities.; METHOD: The data were collected using a diary which was completed after each commercial sexual encounter with a male client over a two-week period. The data reported in this study are based on reports from 2,088 sex encounters and a profile of 1,776 clients.; RESULTS: The findings reveal, for example, that the most common source used for recruiting clients was advertisements, followed by escort agencies, although there were differences between the three cities; the majority of the clients were in their 40s but clients of street workers were younger; clients were most often classified as 'middle class', with differences by source of client recruitment; less than half the clients were identified as being gay and a significant number were identified as bisexual or straight; alcohol and drug use took place in a small percentage of the encounters; most workers had some information about their clients, such as occupation and home number; violence was infrequent; and unsafe sex was requested in a minority of the encounters.; CONCLUSION: Overall, the results reveal that clients of male sex workers are a highly heterogeneous group.; IMPLICATIONS: The paper highlights a number of issues which can further promote safety and public accountability in male sex work.

AB Three children, two girls aged 9 and 13 years and a boy aged 9 years, and a man aged 22, presented with headache of migrainoid character. The complaints resolved after attention had been given to sleeping habits, notably problems with falling asleep. The literature on the relationship between lack of sleep and headache is scarce. In history-taking doctors often neglect sleeping customs. Yet awareness of this connection can provide the clue to a successful treatment of headache. In more than half the children with headache who are referred to the outpatient clinic of Neurology, a serious lack of sleep is a major contributing factor to the problems. One should strongly advise against use of coffee and Cola drinks at all times and of tea in the evening. Patients are urged to create a restful atmosphere about bedtime: taking a walk or a hot shower, being told a story and so on. They should not read in bed, watch TV or play computer games in the bedroom. Prescription of clonidine 0.025-0.075 mg in children before bedtime may be useful.

AB Although codeine is a widely used medication, the problems of codeine abuse and dependence have not been well-studied. This study characterized regular codeine users (using at least 3 days per week for 6 months, excluding those using codeine for the treatment of cancer pain) through a self-completed questionnaire. Recruitment through newspaper advertisements resulted in a total of 339 eligible questionnaires. Thirty-seven percent of subjects met DSM-IV criteria for codeine dependence. Dependent subjects (mean age, 40 +/- 10 years) were using an average of 179 (+/-171) mg of codeine per day. Codeine was predominantly used in the form of combination products with acetaminophen. Dependent subjects identified specific problems causally related to their codeine use such as depression (23%), anxiety (21%), and gastrointestinal disturbances (13%). The dependent subjects reported problems with other drugs more than did nondependent users (alcohol, 57% vs. 26%; cannabis, 23% vs. 5%; sedative/hypnotics, 33% vs. 12%; and heroin, 11% vs. 2%, respectively). Most were taking codeine primarily for a chronic pain problem (81%), although the dependent subjects currently found codeine less effective for treating pain than did the nondependent subjects and were more likely to use codeine for pleasurable effects, to relax, or to prevent withdrawal symptoms. This study showed that dependence is associated with the regular use of codeine. Pain is a key issue with these users; however, they are probably not receiving optimal treatment. There is a need to identify individuals experiencing problems with their codeine use and to develop optimal prevention and treatment strategies.

AB To examine whether there is a tendency for individuals to be multiply addicted, overlapping addictions to common substances (alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, cigarettes) and activities (exercise, gambling, Internet use, television, video games) were studied in 129 college men and women. Contrary to previous research, moderate to large correlations were found, both within and between substances and activities. Self-esteem was positively related to exercise but unrelated to the remaining addictions. Several gender differences in addictive tendencies were also revealed: Men scored higher than women on addiction to alcohol, cigarettes, gambling, television, and Internet use, but women scored higher on caffeine and chocolate. The results have implications for theories of addiction and suggest new directions for the study of addiction among normally functioning young adults.

AB The aim of this study is to identify social factors that could be related to differential rates of mortality decline for men and women in Sweden. The annual changes in fifteen indicators and their relationship with changes in absolute excess male mortality were analyzed by means of time series analysis for the period 1945-1992. Economic growth seems to have been more beneficial for women's survival than for that of men. A few labor market indicators (unemployment rate and the wage ratio men/women) may have had some influence on changes in excess male mortality as well. Consumption factors, such as alcohol consumption and cigarette consumption, have been important for changes in excess male mortality. Changes in excess male mortality have been particularly pronounced among 65-74 year olds, due to rapidly improved female survival in these age groups. I discuss the finding that there seem to be connections between, on the one hand, changes in general social factors such as economic growth and labor market factors, and perhaps urbanization and alcohol and cigarette consumption on the other. I therefore suggest that gender-specific consumer behavior, seen as an outcome of gender-specific norm systems, is one mechanism which links changes in general social factors to changes in excess male mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: The cigarette smoking habit continues to be prevalent to a greater degree than would be desirable among teenagers. Innovative prevention programs are needed. This descriptive cross-sectional study sets out the behavior variables related to the cigarette smoking habit and the extracurricular activities in which teenagers are most frequently involved which are useful for setting out extracurricular prevention programs.; METHODS: The data was collected by means of a questionnaire validated in a representative sample of school age youths (ages 10-11 and 13-14) from Asturias. The variables entailed in cigarette smoking were analyzed using the regression method.; RESULTS: The starting smoker percentage is 14.5%-42.5%, regular smokers totaling 1.1% and 12.4%, respectively. Two models were constructed with the variables significantly related to smoking behavior, which are properly classified into smoker/non-smoker by 98.85% and 91.39% of the children, by ages. The environmental variables (availability of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages and regular visits to places entailing risk) are the major aspects comprising the model. The most common extracurricular activities are: watching TV, reading and listening to music and watching or playing sports.; CONCLUSION: The findings provide keys to planning extracurricular activities tailored to fit in with the activities most popular among teens: TV commercials and ads on music media (CD's, tapes, etc.) and printed information mailed directly to teens at their homes, with messages conveyed by opinion-leaders among teens in the fields of sports, music and television.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the influences related to social mobility, particularly health related behaviours, as one potential explanation for the social class variation in health among adults.; DESIGN: The study is based on questionnaire data from the Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Surveys of 1985, 1987, and 1989.; SETTING: The whole of Finland.; PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of 8355 adolescents. The response rate was 79%.; MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The relation between social mobility and health related behaviours among 16 and 18 year old young people was studied. The measure of social mobility was based on a combination of the social class of origin and achieved social position measured by the present educational status, educational attainment, and labour market position. Three mobility groups were constructed: the downwardly mobile, the upwardly mobile and the stable. Health related behaviours in an upwardly or downwardly mobile group were compared with a stable group from the same social class of origin by calculating relative risks (RR). RRs were assessed by calculating age and sex adjusted rate ratios approximating a Mantel-Haenszel estimate. In logistic regression analyses the independent effects of the social class of origin and the achieved social position were investigated. Most of the nine behaviours studied (smoking, alcohol use, heavy intoxication, coffee drinking, tooth brushing, consumption of sweets, lack of physical exercise, choice of bread spread, and consumption of milk) were related to the direction of mobility so that health compromising behaviours were more frequent among downwardly mobile and less frequent among upwardly mobile young people than their stable peers. Achieved social position proved to determine health related behaviours more strongly than class of origin, thus emphasising the way education facilitates both health values and behaviours as well as the future social position.; CONCLUSIONS: The close relation between social mobility and health related behaviours is concluded to be a part of an explanation of social class differences in health observed among adults.

AB The US government's Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) launched its new antidrug media campaign in July 1998. The campaign is likely to increase awareness of the youth drug problem, but shortcomings in the campaign's early implementation raise questions about its potential for changing behavior. Shortcomings include: a) The first wave of ONDCP's television advertisements are focused on reinforcing problem awareness but do not model skills or provide other information necessary for behavior change; b) the campaign provides insufficient focus on promoting drug treatment and citizen involvement in local prevention activities, including political action; c) the campaign is being implemented without a major new investment in drug-treatment programs or community-based prevention programs; d) The campaign does not substantively address alcohol and tobacco, which pose a clear threat to health and serve as a "gateway" to illicit drug use; and e) the first wave of television advertisements use exaggerated fear appeals, a strategy shown by research rarely to be successful. Only time will tell whether the ONDCP media campaign will succeed or fail. Using past research as a guide, there is legitimate reason for concern that the campaign will not live up to expectations.

AB Our project was conducted to determine if the deleterious effects of chronic alcohol consumption on growing bone are reversible if the adolescent stops drinking. Four-week old, female, Sprague-Dawley rats were housed and maintained in an AAALAC-accredited facility. Six animals each were placed on alcohol-fed (35% ethanol-derived calories), pair-fed or chow-fed diets for 2 or 4 weeks. A recovery group of six animals was alcohol-fed for 2 weeks followed by an additional 2 weeks of chow feeding. This group was pair-fed to an additional group of six animals that received liquid diet, pair fed to the recovery group for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks on a pair-fed chow diet. Blood alcohol concentrations averaged 309 +/- 9 mg/dl. Morphological parameters of the femur, such as length, diameter, and volume were smaller in alcohol treated animals at both 2 and 4 weeks of feeding. Femur length and volume of recovery alcohol-fed animals were more than either 2- or 4-week alcohol-fed animals, but they were not as great as the same-age 4-week pair-fed or chow-fed animals. Diameter was similar to the 4-week alcohol-fed, but less than the chow-fed. Femur density was reduced at all time periods in the alcohol-fed animals. The recovery alcohol-fed animals had greater density than the 2-week alcohol, but not the 4-week alcohol-fed animals. They did not, however, reach 4-week chow- or pair-fed levels. Tibia BV/TV was reduced in the 2- and 4-week alcohol- and pair-fed animals. BV/TV was greater in the recovery animals than either 2- or 4-week alcohols, but not as great as the chow-fed animals. At 2 weeks, calorie deprivation caused a reduction in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that was reduced even more by alcohol. By 4 weeks, the calorie deprivation was no longer seen, but alcohol continued to reduce the values. Two weeks of alcohol followed by 2 weeks of chow diet returned the IGF-1 values to almost normal, but significantly different levels. The apparent improvement was probably due to continued growth of the young bones and not a regaining of bone lost during alcohol consumption.

AB OBJECTIVE: There has been international concern over the balance of television advertising for healthy and less-healthy foods to which children and adolescents are exposed. This study examined the extent to which 9-17 year old New Zealanders were exposed to advertising for different food groups over a year and compared New Zealand rates of advertising with a 13-country study.; METHOD: 'People meter' data collected over three months--May and September 1995 and February 1996--and food advertising from a sample week of television during hours when children were likely to be watching were also examined. Comparison was made with a similar 1989 South Australian study and an international study covering 13 countries.; RESULTS: Both the exposure estimated for a year and the opportunities for exposure during the sample week were highest for sweet snacks, drinks, fast food/takeaways and breakfast cereals. There were very low levels for fruit, vegetables, and meat/fish/eggs. Water was not advertised in any sample month. Comparisons with the 13-country study showed New Zealand had the third-highest rate of food advertising, the highest rate of confectionery and drinks advertising, and the second-highest rate of restaurant advertising which included fast food restaurants.; CONCLUSION: Current patterns of food advertising pose a conflict of interest between public health and commercial interests. Regulation of food advertising may be needed to address this in order to improve future health.

The information is based on a survey applied to Caracas Metropolitan Area (CMA) inhabitants between 18 and 70 years of age (n = 1,297) selected by probabilistic, biphasic, and tetra-stage sampling, and at random following the Politz method. The instrument was a questionnaire with on scale answers Likert type. The information was treated with multi-varying statistical analysis, using the association technique between two variables by means of the Chi-square test, with conditional independence log-linear for three variables. The results suggest relatively low violence levels between couples and towards children. Regarding children, women tend to be more violent with them, most probably explained by factors relating income and unemployment. It was found that the bigger the accord with the norm to discipline children with physical violence, the bigger the frequency of violent behavior towards them. On the contrary, the bigger the conviction to be skilled in handling situations without violence, the lesser the frequency of violent behavior. Regarding violence between couples no association was found with the sex variable, but one can certainly talk about violent couples, which is related to the way of coupling, unemployment, and lack of formal education. From the norm point of view, a relationship between belief in the norms and violent behavior is observed, although these norms and attitudes are measured by the ability of the couple of control himself/herself and act in a non-violent way.

AB Over 70% of human cancers are associated with lifestyle and about half of cancer deaths could be prevented by relatively simple individual actions: no smoking, moderate consumption of alcohol, increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, avoidance of sunbathing, obesity and a too high consumption of saturated lipids. Most of these efforts would also markedly decrease the incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, the concept of prevention is currently neither well accepted nor understood by the medical community and the general public. It is often felt that it restricts freedom, imposes a choice between pleasure and duty, and that passing judgement on lifestyle is a form of intolerance. The case of tobacco illustrates the difficulties encountered by prevention, notably among adolescents. The fight against smoking requires information, a societal approach (ban on advertising, increase in price), and a reduction of the example given by adult smoking (parents, peers, teachers, physicians, TV presenters, movie stars, have a great influence on adolescents), while tobacco cessation programs must be promoted. The various approaches should be integrated into a global program of health prevention, including health education at school from 5 to 12 years of age. The efficacy of each of the global program's components should be evaluated. Misconceptions such as overestimation of the impact of pollution on health should also be corrected. Health is created and experienced by people within the setting of their daily lives, in particular during childhood. Prevention is the responsibility of individual members of the community but also of the community as a whole.

AB Drinking and driving is prevalent among college students, particularly among underage college students. Although most of these students know that drunk driving is a potentially harmful behavior, many of them still make the decision to do so. The purpose of this study was to determine why underage students drink and drive and what consequences, if any, these students fear when they engage in this behavior. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted, using the Health Belief Model as a guide for discussion topics. Participants revealed that PSAs focusing on relevant, localized consequences would have more meaning to underage college students than the more general campaigns that they reported seeing. In addition, they revealed that the consequence that they fear most is being charged with a DUI, yet current anti-drinking and driving PSAs never portray this as a possible negative consequence.

Findings indicate that the majority of the respondents tend to enhance alcohol control measures pertaining to alcohol and driving issues, but only about a third of the participants tend to enhance alcohol control measures in the other domains. In addition, Arabs tend to favor restrictive attitudes toward alcohol control measures in comparison with Jews, and Arab females tend to favor such attitudes more than Arab males. Implications for prevention and effective alcohol policy are discussed.

Male and female college students rated the advertisements of these product groups on a number of traits--adventurous, eye-catching, appealing, informative, believable, good times, recreational, effectiveness, romantic, athletic, buy product, and honesty. Drawing on their everyday experience, the students also were asked to recall as much about the advertisements from these product groups as they could. The results revealed that the rating and recall scores of the alcohol advertisements were significantly higher than those for the cigarette advertisements and among the highest of all of the advertisement groups. The female recall scores generally were significantly higher than the male recall scores. In contrast to the cigarette advertisements, the high scores of the alcohol advertisements were interpreted to be due in part to the wider distribution alcohol advertising has had. That alcohol advertising ranked among the highest of all of the advertising groups indicates that college students view alcohol advertising very favorably.

AB Reducing the availability of alcohol through alcohol control policies such as excise taxes and the minimum legal drinking age has been effective in reducing a wide range of alcohol-related problems, including traffic crashes, liver cirrhosis, and violence. Alcohol control policies may be classified into two overlapping categories--public and institutional policies. Some policies such as alcohol server training may be either mandated by governmental jurisdictions or voluntarily adopted by individual institutions, which include alcohol retail establishments, other businesses, worksites, schools, colleges/universities, law enforcement agencies, religious institutions, insurance agencies, and alcohol producers. Public policies may be mandated by national, state/provincial, or local governments to regulate where, when, and how alcohol is sold and consumed. This paper describes the wide array of public and institutional policies available to reduce alcohol-related problems. Summaries of research evaluating specific alcohol control policies are provided when available.

AB A 10-hour small-group informational and skill-building intervention was tested among patients (N = 472) attending publicly funded sexually transmitted disease clinics in Maryland, Georgia, and New Jersey. After completing a 90-minute interview concerning HIV risk behaviors, condom use self-efficacy and condom outcome expectancies, participants were randomized to either an intervention or a control condition. Participants in both conditions displayed significant reductions in unprotected encounters and number of partners and increases in condom use. No differences between treatment conditions were observed, indicating that the motivational effects of the interview may have been stronger than the effects of the intervention in this population. 
A2 Sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment services in low-income
   communities offer an effective arena for accessing those at greatest
   risk for HIV infection.  This study evaluated an intensive HIV risk
   reduction program implemented in publicly funded STD clinics in
   Maryland, Georgia, and New Jersey (US).  After completion of a 90-minute
   interview on HIV risk behaviors, condom use self-efficacy, and condom
   outcome expectancies, the 472 study participants were randomly assigned
   to either a 10-hour behavioral intervention designed to increase condom
   use self-efficacy through modeling and skill building or routine brief
   counseling.  The average age of respondents was 30.1 years; they
   reported an average of 3.2 lifetime STDs.  Participants in both the
   intervention and control groups reported significant reductions in the
   number of sexual partners and unprotected sexual encounters and
   significant increases in condom use at the 90-day follow-up interview,
   with no significant differences between groups.  Four possible
   moderators of behavior change--gender, crack or heroin use, alcohol
   problems, and child sex abuse--were not significant.  The possibility
   that the baseline interview, not the intervention, motivated the
   observed changes in sexual behavior merits consideration.

AB Recent reports show an increase in smoking among college students and suggest that occasional smoking is now initiated by previously nonsmoking students. This study evaluated whether this apparent increase in smoking by students is associated with positive self-images associated with smoking. Regular and occasional smokers rated how smoking "changes the way you feel about yourself" on 18 self-attributes that may be associated with smoking, e.g., from cigarette advertisements. Nonsmokers also rated smokers on the same 18 attributes. All three groups rated three attributes in the negative direction with at least a moderate effect size: that being a smoker was less healthy, that smokers were less desirable as a date and that smokers were less attractive while smoking. On only one other attribute regular smokers differed from neutral with at least a moderate effect size: that smoking made them feel less feminine. As hypothesized, the occasional smokers also rated some attributions positively with at least a moderate effect size: that smoking made them feel more daring and more adventurous and did not make them feel like an outcast. The nonsmokers rated a number of additional attributes about smokers negatively with at least a moderate effect size: that smokers are less sexy, less feminine, less sophisticated, less masculine, and less mature. Thus, the results suggest that smoking shows at best mixed associations with self-attributions of college students who smoke and is viewed negatively by those who do not smoke. Other results suggest that the recent increase in occasional smoking may be related to smoking with friends who smoke and smoking while drinking alcohol.

AB Burns are a significant health problem in Brazil, but there have been few data collected that could shape treatment and prevention programs. To help overcome that knowledge gap, this study looked at the types of accidents and the characteristics of 138 burn patients admitted into the burn unit of the University of Sao Paulo Hospital in Ribeirao Preto, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between November, 1991, and December, 1993. Patient charts were reviewed to collect data on age, sex, region of the body affected, burn depth and surface affected, agent causing the burn, and circumstances in which the burn happened. Of the 138 cases, 71% occurred in the home. In 50% of all accidents the victims were children. Boiling water was the agent responsible for 59% of the accidents among children younger than 3 years of age; fuel alcohol used in the home for cooking and other purposes caused 57% of the accidents among children between 7 and 11 years, the most affected pediatric group. Among adults, the group between 20 and 39 years of age was the most affected (23%); 84% of the victims in this age group were male. Seventeen percent of all cases involved adult males at work. Women suffered burns in accidents at home (67%) and in suicide-related events (33%). Seventy-five percent of the suicide cases were women. The strategies to reduce the incidence of burn injuries should aim at eliminating environmental risk factors and implementing educational programs disseminated through radio and television.

AB OBJECTIVE: Alcohol use is frequently portrayed in television programming and advertising. Exposure to media portrayals of alcohol use may lead to increased drinking. To address this issue, we examined prospectively the associations between media exposure and alcohol use in adolescents.; DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Setting. Six public high schools in San Jose, California. Participants. Ninth-grade students (N = 1533; mean age = 14.6 years).; OUTCOME MEASURES: Students reported hours of television, music video, and videotape viewing; computer and video game use; and lifetime and past 30 days' alcohol use at baseline and 18 months later. Associations between baseline media exposure and subsequent alcohol use were examined with multiple logistic regression.; RESULTS: During the 18-month follow-up, 36.2% of baseline nondrinkers began drinking and 50.7% of baseline drinkers continued to drink. Onset of drinking was significantly associated with baseline hours of television viewing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.01-1.18), music video viewing (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1. 17-1.47), and videotape viewing (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.79-0.99), controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and other media use. Computer and video game use was not significantly associated with the subsequent onset of drinking. Among baseline drinkers, there were no significant associations between baseline media use and maintenance of drinking.; CONCLUSIONS: Increased television and music video viewing are risk factors for the onset of alcohol use in adolescents. Attempts to prevent adolescent alcohol use should address the adverse influences of alcohol use in the media.

PD 1998 Sep
AB The paper discusses the relationship between the images of alcohol and society, on one hand, and the reality of drinking and drinking problems on the other hand, from the point of view of policy-relevant research. Images of alcohol influence policy but they also depend on the social and cultural environment of policy-making. The epidemiological total consumption theory of alcohol-related problems is used as an example. The theory is embedded in the modern welfare state's ideals and its policy relevance presupposes that these ideals--universalism, consequentialism and public planning--are respected. If the approach today receives less attention by policy-makers than its empirical validity merits, it may be due to an erosion of these ideals, not of the epidemiological model itself. Images of alcohol influence behaviour and drinking problems but they also articulate the social context in which the images are constructed. This paper demonstrates the point, applying Levi-Straussian cultural theory to an analysis of a recent beer advertisement addressed to young people. The advertisement not only reflects the images associated with youthful drinking but also the ambiguous status of youth as non-adults in contemporary society. The author stresses that for social and cultural research alcohol is a two-way window, to look at society through alcohol and to look at alcohol through society. Both directions are necessary for policy-relevant research.

AB OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the effectiveness of a community education campaign to encourage a switch from high-fat (whole and 2%) milk to low-fat (1%, 1/2%, and skim) milk as a way to reduce consumption of saturated fat.; METHODS: Milk sales data were collected from supermarkets in the intervention and comparison communities for three one-month time periods: at baseline, immediately following the campaign, and six months after the campaign. In addition, trained volunteers conducted pre- and post-intervention telephone surveys.; RESULTS: Overall milk sales increased by 16% in the intervention cities following the campaign and remained high at follow-up. Low-fat milk's market share increased from 18% of overall milk sales at baseline to 41% of overall milk sales in the month following the end of the campaign, an increase in market share that was sustained at the six-month follow-up. In the post-intervention telephone survey, 38.2% of those respondents who reported drinking high-fat milk at baseline reported having switched to low-fat milk.; CONCLUSION: A focused message communicated through paid advertising, public relations activities, and community-based education programs increased low-fat and overall milk consumption in one community.

AB Behaviors related to nutrition as well as the eating habits of low-income French people are analyzed from data collected by the Nutrition and Health Barometer of the CFES in 1996. French people with monthly incomes of less than 4000 francs appear to go to fast-food restaurants more often than to other types of restaurant (for leisure or work). They appear to eat their three main meals alone more often, to spend less time over the evening meal, to watch television during their noon and evening meals, to have cheese or another dairy product rather than a main dish, and to limit their evening meal to a single dish. They are less numerous than higher-income people to have the "ideal" breakfast. These economically disavantaged French people do their shopping more often in large of medium-sized supermarkets and more often plan their meals according to the family budget. In terms of food they are more numerous to eat neither fruit nor vegetables; they consume less pork, fish and shellfish, dairy products, alcoholic beverages and especially before-dinner drinks. This study shows that the eating behavior of low-income French people is less in conformity with commonly accepted nutritional recommendations. Likewise, the rate of obesity observed among the women from this households appears high.

AB AIMS: To test a hypothesized model of the effect of televised alcohol advertising and allegiance to specific brands of beer on subsequent beer consumption and self-reports of aggressive behaviour linked with drinking.; DESIGN: Structural equation modelling was used to assess the fit between data collected as part of a longitudinal study of young people's health and development and a hypothesized model based on theoretical perspectives and previous research.; SETTING: A birth cohort has been assessed every few years, most of them in their home city of Dunedin, New Zealand. The questions about alcohol are asked as part of the day-long assessment.; PARTICIPANTS: Members of a longitudinal survey cohort at ages 18 and 21 years. Data from 630 beer drinking participants were analysed in this study.; MEASUREMENTS: Responses to questions about beer consumption, liking for advertising, favourite brand of beer and self-reports of alcohol-related aggressive behaviour.; FINDINGS: Our hypothesized model assumed a positive impact of liking of alcohol advertising and brand allegiance at age 18 on the volume of beer consumed at age 21 and self-reports of alcohol-related aggressive behaviour. This was found to be a good fit to the data from the longitudinal study.; CONCLUSION: This measurable impact of alcohol advertising occurred during a time of decline in aggregate alcohol in New Zealand. While this effect was not large enough to halt the decline in aggregate alcohol consumption it does indicate a measurable, specific impact of broadcast alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and related behaviour which is of relevance for public health policy.

AB As part of the evaluation of a community-level HIV prevention program for women, this study examined predictors of exposure to print media and community outreach and assessed the relationship between exposure to the intervention and condom use behavior. Data from interviews with 479 women randomly selected from the intervention community in 1995 and 1996 were examined. Analysis of demographic and risk characteristics were conducted to identify predictors of exposure to the project's HIV prevention messages. Additionally, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of intervention exposure on condom use, controlling for factors related to exposure. The results revealed that the print media campaign reached the largest number of women. However, women at highest risk did not have high rates of exposure to print media, but had greater exposure to outreach. Exposure to print media had an effect on increased communication with a main partner about condom use, but was not significantly related to condom use last time had sex. There were no significant main effects for exposure to outreach on condom use behavior. An important finding of this analysis was that each intervention strategy was successful in reaching a different portion of the target population and that exposure had differential effects on the condom use behavior of particular segments of the target population. 
A2 The five-city Prevention of HIV in Women and Infants Demonstration
   Projects (WIDP) evaluated a community-level intervention aimed at
   promoting condom use by young urban women at risk for HIV infection
   through print media and community outreach.  This article analyzes data
   from interviews with 479 women 15-34 years of age randomly selected from
   the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (US), intervention community in 1995 and
   1996.  By the time of the 1995 and 1996 surveys, 51% of women in the
   intervention community had been exposed.  Exposure to print media peaked
   in 1995 at 46% and levelled off at 44% in 1996, while exposure to
   community outreach decreased from 23% in 1995 to 14% in 1996.  Logistic
   regression analysis indicated that exposure to print media was highest
   among women currently in drug or alcohol treatment and those who
   reported binge drinking in the preceding month; exposure to outreach
   activities was greatest among women who had a sexually transmitted
   disease (STD) history and exchanged sex for money.  For women over 21
   years old who had ever had an STD and were employed, exposure to print
   media was strongly predictive of condom use at last intercourse.  Women
   who exchanged sex for money and were exposed to community outreach were
   unlikely to use condoms, but prone to discuss condoms with their main
   partner, which may be a pathway to future condom use.  Program planners
   must identify the specific population groups they want to reach and plan
   intervention strategies accordingly.  Several different strategies may
   be required to ensure messages reach those at greatest risk of HIV.

AB AIMS: This study investigated whether child abuse (CSA) was associated with earlier substance use and greater severity of substance dependence and what aspects of CSA might predict substance abuse.; DESIGN: The study compared (a) drug and alcohol treatment clients with and without a history of CSA and (b) CSA survivors outside drug and alcohol treatment who did or did not have current substance abuse.; SETTINGS: Semi-structured interviews took place at participants' homes, treatment agencies or the research centre.; PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer participants included 100 women recruited from drug and alcohol treatment programmes and 80 CSA survivors recruited through CSA counseling services and medial advertising.; MEASUREMENTS: The results focus on data from the Opiate Treatment Index, Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire, Substance Dependence Scale, Self-Esteem Inventory and self-reported histories of CSA.; FINDINGS: There were no differences between CSA survivors and other drug and alcohol treatment clients in their severity of dependence. Women with a history of CSA more frequently identified stimulants as their main problem drug and reported an earlier age of first intoxication and earlier use of inhalants. Among abused CSA survivors outside drug and alcohol treatment, women with current substance abuse had typically been abused during adolescence by someone outside the family, whereas those without current substance abuse were typically abused by family members before adolescence.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that adolescence is a crucial time for the influence of CSA experiences on substance abuse.

The model, which provided a good fit to the data, was consistent with the hypothesis that liking of beer advertisements had both a direct influence on quantities of alcohol consumed and an indirect influence, via its influence on positive beliefs. These effects were present after controlling for reciprocal effects, none of which were significant. The data did not support the hypothesis that the quantities of alcohol consumed would influence the respondent's liking of beer advertisements. Recalled exposure was not a significant influence on the quantities consumed.; CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with a number of theoretical perspectives and with a growing body of research that are suggestive of alcohol advertising having some influence on the consumption of younger people.

AB OBJECTIVE: The research in this article is designed to improve our understanding of alcohol messages embedded in prime-time television, especially when adolescent characters are shown portraying or consuming alcohol.; METHOD: Manifest and latent content analyses are used to assess the frequency of alcohol portrayal in prime-time television and the personality traits (powerful, admirable, smart) of characters shown consuming or portraying alcohol on prime-time television. The sample includes 224 hours of programming across 276 programs on four major networks.; RESULTS: Alcoholic beverages were the most frequently portrayed food or drink. The prominence of alcohol in prime-time television applies to all characters, including adolescents. The proportion of all food and drink incidents accounted for by alcohol equaled .14 for male and .20 for female adolescent television characters. Moreover, when adolescent characters are involved with alcohol incidents, they are more likely to be shown consuming this alcohol than are adults. A significant finding was that adolescents portraying alcohol in programming were shown to have significantly more negative personality characteristics than did characters in older age groups.; CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other studies, this study finds higher rates of alcohol portrayal by adolescents on prime-time television. The negative character portrayal of adolescents involved with alcohol is encouraging. However, adult and high-income characters involved with alcohol, who might serve as role models for younger adults are, on average, shown with positive personality characteristics.

There was no evidence for the hypothesized reciprocal effects; the frequency of drinking (including non-drinking) did not significantly affect the respondent's liking of beer advertisements. There was also no support for a hypothesis that linking of the beer advertisements was a product of a general liking for alcohol. Many of the young people themselves felt that alcohol advertising encouraged teenagers to drink. This was especially the case among 10-13-year-old males, who were the most likely to accept the portrayals in alcohol advertising as realistic.; CONCLUSIONS: Although there are limitations on the confidence with which conclusions can be drawn, the findings are consistent with qualitative and quantitative research and different theoretical perspectives on advertising processes which suggest alcohol advertising is likely to have some influence on young people.

AB Motor vehicle-related accidents and firearm-related violence are the first and second leading causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality. Fortunately, considerable progress has been made in reducing motor vehicle-related injuries and death through state-level legislation designed to decrease alcohol use and increase seat belt use. Homicide and suicide, however, are increasing dramatically among teenagers. Family violence and the epidemic of gang activity also contribute significantly to both; violence portrayed on television, in movies, and in adolescent music also has become a more significant part of teen life. Family physicians are encouraged to implement preventive strategies for combating the problems of injury and violence in their offices, their communities, and on the broader states of medical education and public policy.

AB The immediate effects of a media intervention on attitudes toward alcohol were investigated with 134 secondary school pupils (aged 13 to 17 years) who completed a drinking and smoking questionnaire and expressed strength of agreement or disagreement with 13 statements about alcohol, drinking and health. Pupils then read news cuttings from popular magazines. One group read a negative message about alcohol, another group a positive message. Other groups read both positive and negative messages, and a control group had no media intervention. Immediately afterwards, all pupils responded to the same 13 statements again. Those pupils who received only a negative message became significantly more negative in their attitudes towards alcohol. Those receiving only a positive message were significantly more positive afterwards. The control group and those receiving both positive and negative messages showed little change. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for alcohol education programs at school.

AB As part of a 3-year evaluation of substance abuse prevention strategies (Harding, Safer, Kavanagh, Bania, Carty, Lisnov, & Wysockey, 1996), this study examined the perceptions of 719 sixth- through ninth-grade Chicago public school students. School-based programs were rated as significantly more effective on six prevention objectives than were television ads, testimonials by famous people, billboards, and print ads displayed on public transportation. Students perceived the two school-based programs, Project DARE (a national program conducted through local police departments) and Captain Clean (an intense live theater program coordinated with student participation), as being equally effective overall, although the interactive theater program was rated as significantly better at encouraging students to talk about their feelings concerning substance abuse issues and at relating to the students' ethnic/racial backgrounds. When students were categorized according to frequency of alcohol use, nonusers, infrequent users, and frequent users differed significantly in their ratings of the school-based programs.

AB Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that some water supply and sanitation (WSS) interventions are highly cost-effective for the control of diarrhoea among under-5-year-olds, on a par with oral rehydration therapy. These are relatively inexpensive "software-related" interventions such as hygiene education, social marketing of good hygiene practices, regulation of drinking-water, and monitoring of water quality. Such interventions are needed to ensure that the potentially positive health impacts of WSS infrastructure are fully realized in practice. The perception that WSS programmes are not a cost-effective use of health sector resources has arisen from three factors: an assumption that all WSS interventions involve construction of physical infrastructure, a misperception of the health sector's role in WSS programmes, and a misunderstanding of the scope of cost-effectiveness analysis. WSS infrastructure ("hardware") is generally built and operated by public works agencies and financed by construction grants, operational subsidies, user fees and property taxes. Health sector agencies should provide "software" such as project design, hygiene education, and water quality regulation. Cost-effectiveness analysis should measure the incremental health impacts attributable to health sector investments, using the actual call on health sector resources as the measure of cost. The cost-effectiveness of a set of hardware and software combinations is estimated, using US$ per case averted, US$ per death averted, and US$ per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) saved.

AB African-American women are heavier than European-American women; the reasons are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine potentially modifiable reasons for the weight difference among 86,326 female nurses. The determinants of body mass index (BMI) were modelled using the method of linear regression. The findings included the following: mean BMI (kg/m2) was 9.0% (95% CI, 7.8-10.1%) higher among African American (27.3) than among European-American women (25.1) (P<0.0001). However, recalled BMI at age 18 was equal in the two groups (21.4, P=0.98). Multivariate determinants of BMI include age, age 18 BMI, alcohol and calorie intake, exercise, marital status, parity, race, recent intentional weight loss, smoking, and television watching. Even after controlling for these factors, African-American women still had an 8.6% (95% CI, 7.7-9.5%) higher BMI than European-American women. Correction for error in measurement of physical activity attenuated this difference to 6.4% (95% CI, 5.0-7.8%). In conclusion, in this single occupation group, African-American women had a significantly higher BMI than European-American women. Age and measured behavioral factors did not explain this difference. However, imprecision in the measurement of diet and activity may explain this difference in part. Better measurement may help quantify the differences that are as yet unexplained.

AB Altered motor vehicle drivers's licenses or other falsified or counterfeit photo identification cards are widely and illegally used by teenagers to obtain beer and other alcohol beverages. We obtained information on the methods currently used by teenagers to purchase beer and wine by asking nine hundred teenagers, between 16-19 years old to complete a brief, confidential questionnaire. High school students most often obtained alcoholic beverages by requesting someone of legal age to purchase it for them. College students used borrowed, altered, or counterfeit identification (ID) more often than high school students. Photo IDs purchased through mail order from a magazine advertisement were used infrequently and when use was attempted, they were sometimes (25%) unsuccessful. Fifteen percent of high school students, 14% of college freshmen, and 24% of teenage drug abusers were able to purchase beer by the case with borrowed, altered, or fake ID. Suggestions to reduce sales of alcohol-containing beverages to minors include universal "carding" of prospective purchasers, use of two view or hologram photos on a drivers' license, requiring three different ID cards at the point of purchase, and penalties to stores that fail to make a good effort to identify underage customers.

AB This paper examines targeted alcohol advertising in three ethnic communities: African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans in the U.S. We focus on the appropriation of cultural systems and the reinvention of them as commodities to consumers. We outline the specific strategies used in each ethnic community. For African Americans, there is an emphasis on selling malt liquor to young adults through the use of "power" and gang-related images. For Latinos, there is an appropriation of historical and cultural symbols such as the national flags and maps of Mexico and Central America. Native Americans have coalesced to keep the image of a chief and warrior, Crazy Horse, from being used to market malt liquor. Each of the ethnic groups is engaged in action to prevent alcohol-related problems in their communities. Generating and implementing solutions is a universal social responsibility.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to determine the impact of currently available oral contraceptive agents (OCAs), smoking, and alcohol on biochemical indexes of folate and vitamin B-12 in adolescent females.; DESIGN: Subjects completed a 3-day weighed food record along with a detailed lifestyle questionnaire that included questions on OCA, cigarette, and alcohol use. After subjects had fasted overnight, blood samples were collected and analyzed for levels of serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate and serum B-12 and homocysteine.; SUBJECTS/SETTINGS: Two hundred twenty-nine adolescent females (aged 14 to 20 years) were recruited from southern Ontario, Canada, by advertisements in newspapers, high schools, universities, shopping malls, adolescent drop-in centers, and community groups.; STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Multiple regression models were used to determine the effect of lifestyle factors and covariates (e.g., dietary folate intake, supplemental folate intake, and age) on biochemical indexes.; RESULTS: OCA use, alcohol use, and smoking were not significantly associated with lower serum or RBC folate levels, after controlling for folate intake. Serum homocysteine levels were not associated with smoking or OCA use; however, we estimated a 13% higher concentration among alcohol users than nonusers. Smoking and alcohol use were not associated with serum B-12 levels, but OCA use was associated with an estimated 33% lower serum B-12 level than nonuse.; APPLICATIONS: Our findings provide no evidence to suggest that currently available OCAs have a negative impact on the folate status of adolescent females; thus, dietary advice designed to specifically encourage an increase in folate intake among adolescents who use OCAs is not supported. In contrast, serum B-12 levels were lower among OCA users than nonusers, which suggests that an interaction between OCA and some vitamins may persist. The suboptimal biochemical folate indexes of smokers may have more to do with the dietary quality of smokers than previously appreciated. Thus, efforts to improve dietary folate intakes of adolescents who smoke may be an important strategy for improving the folate status of young women. 
A2 The impact of oral contraceptive (OC) use, smoking, and alcohol drinking
   on biochemical indexes of folate and vitamin B-12 was investigated in
   229 adolescents 14-20 years old recruited from advertisements in
   Ontario, Canada.  Subjects completed a life-style questionnaire and a
   3-day, weighed food record, followed by overnight fasting and the
   collection of blood samples.  Of the 48 participants (21%) who were OC
   users, 30 had used the pill for more than 12 months.  Only 37
   adolescents (16%) smoked, but 94 (60%) had consumed alcohol in the month
   preceding the study.  Median daily intake of folate and vitamin B-12
   (including intake from supplements) was 215 mcg and 1.9 mcg,
   respectively.  OC use, smoking, and alcohol consumption were not
   significantly associated with lower serum or red blood cell folate
   levels, after controlling for folate intake.  Serum homocysteine levels
   were not correlated with smoking or OC use, but were 13% higher among
   alcohol drinkers than nondrinkers.  Finally, although smoking and
   alcohol use were not associated with serum B-12 levels, OC use was
   linked with an estimated 33% lower serum B-12 level than was nonuse. 
   These findings fail to validate concerns that OC use has a negative
   impact on the folate status of adolescent females, but suggest a need to
   improve the dietary folate intake of young women who smoke.

AB BACKGROUND: Daytime sleepiness is widespread and has negative impacts on the public sector.; OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the incidence and prevalence of daytime sleepiness and associated risk factors in the general population.; METHOD: In 1994, a representative sample of the non-institutionalized British population aged 15 years or older was interviewed via telephone using an expert computer-assisted program designed to facilitate surveys of this type (Sleep-Eval, M. M. Ohayon, Montreal, Quebec). Subjects were classified into 3 groups based on the severity of their daytime sleepiness. We completed 4972 interviews (acceptance rate, 79.6%).; RESULTS: Severe daytime sleepiness was reported in 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 4.9%-6.1%) of the sample, and moderate daytime sleepiness in another 15.2% (95% confidence interval, 14.2%-16.2%). Associated factors with severe daytime sleepiness included female sex, middle age, napping, insomnia symptoms, high daily caffeine consumption, breathing pauses or leg pain in sleep, depressive disorder (based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria), falling asleep while reading or watching television, and motor vehicle crashes or accidents involving use of machinery. Moderate daytime sleepiness was associated with female sex, napping, insomnia symptoms, arthritis or heart disease, and gross motor movements during sleep.; CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that daytime sleepiness deleteriously affects work activities, social and/or marital life, and exhibits a negative socioeconomic impact. In addition, the risk of a motor vehicle crash appears to be higher in this specific population: twice as many subjects operating a motor vehicle or using machine tools reported having a crash or accident, respectively, in the previous year in the groups with severe daytime sleepiness or moderate daytime sleepiness than did the general population with no daytime sleepiness. The high prevalence rates of daytime sleepiness and multiplicity of related factors mandate further scrutiny by public health officials.

A2 Young people in Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States have
   either witnessed, participated in, or been victims of abrupt changes
   which led to the collapse of the value systems by which they and their
   parents had learned to live.  Their parents' position in society
   changed, with many struggling to support their families in conditions of
   widespread resource scarcity, including shortages of food, electricity,
   heating, and water supplies.  Increased family tension has driven many
   parents to drink more alcohol, thereby increasing the risk of violence
   in the family.  Almost everywhere in the region, young people expressed
   their desire to be better informed about reproductive health issues.  A
   survey found that the overwhelming majority of more than 700 sampled
   youths had learned what they knew about reproductive health from
   friends, television, newspapers, and magazines.  In Romania, lack of
   proper education and social discrimination mean that many people
   infected with STDs seek medical care only when their diseases have
   reached an advanced stage, while studies in Bulgaria show a declining
   mean age at first intercourse and a low level of condom use.  In Turkey,
   an IEC (information, education, and communication) project was launched
   in 26 cities and towns to improve and extend family planning services. 
   Elsewhere, the Orthodox Church in the Russian Federation has called
   abortion murder, young people can get good quality counseling in a range
   of institutions in Estonia, and abortion has become the main means of
   birth control in Ukraine.

AB This study aims to investigate smoking patterns in high school student and to give student smoker effective information. The sample of 250 male high school students out of two different schools in Tae-Jon was questioned from July 10th to 15th, 1995. In analyzing these date, the statistics shows the realities by means of number of students. The results are summarized into 17 items as follows. Regarding the level of smoking, 140 students out of 250 admit that they have ever smoked, 52.1% of smoking students say that the motivation of beginning smoking is mainly curiosity. The survey shows that 22.9% of smoking students feel very good when smoking. It also shows that 30.0% of smoking students began smoking in the first grade of high school. With regard to the volume of smoking per day, 41.4% of smoking students smoke variably, 42.1% drink when smoking, 15.0% spend more than W 70,000 a month. About the question who knows the fact of their smoking, 51.5% answer that their friends know the fact of their smoking. In regard to the reslationship between smoking and school performance, 18.2% of non smoking students make poor grades as compared with 40% of smoking students, 9.3% of smoking students say that they are satisfied with the school life, but 35.7% of them are not satisfied. Regarding the attitude to smoking teachers, 35% of smoking students state that they are affected by them. 69.3% of smoking students say that they will stop smoking, while the remaining 30.7% say that they will keep smoking. The reason of 63.9% to stop smoking is that smoking is bad for the health. The reason of 46.5% to keep smoking is the acquired habit of smoking. 97.2% know the fact that the major element of cigarettes is nicotine and it is very harmful to the health. 40.8% recognize the harmful effect of smoking by TV and radio programs. 97.2% know that smoking could cause lung cancer. From the above results. I propose as follows We should make specific plan to keep smoking by simple curiosity from being developed into habitual smoking. We should teach them how harmful smoking is and make them stop smoking by themselves. It is very essential for family members and teachers to give continuous interest since childhood. As the teacher affect the students very much, they should give up smoking first. The incidence of smoking should be identified in each of the middle and high schools, smoking prohibition programs relevant to each school should be developed and implemented. The local community should ban cigarette vending machines. Cigarettes should not be sold to adolescents. By setting every place where adolescents gather including schools non-smoking area, we should decrease their impulse to smoke, then smoking opportunities, and harmful effects to them caused by passive smoking.

AB With extensive Hispanic community involvement, a television, radio, and storybook novela were developed to improve Hispanic parent-youth communications and youth attitudes regarding alcohol. Focus groups with the target audiences determined the novelas' concentration on alcohol, their medium and language of choice for Hispanic youth versus parents, and the health messages and cultural values to be portrayed. Reactions to the novelas were obtained via self-report surveys, random street interviews, radio listener call-ins, and community group meetings. Favorable reactions were obtained regarding the novelas' cultural sensitivity and appropriateness, and their potential to affect future behavior change. The affect of the television novela on Hispanic youth was evaluated by a pre-post self-report survey administered to middle and high school students. Survey results indicated the television novela may have had some positive impact on Hispanic youth attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding alcohol. The evaluation time line was limiting, however, and further evaluation is required.

Gonorrhoea, chancroid, syphilis seroactivity, trichomoniasis, or objective signs of STD were found in 78%, and HIV seropositivity in 15% of men and 19% of women. Most women were married, living with a spouse; while most men were single, or married, but living separated from a spouse. Among married men, last sex was with a female sex worker (FSW) or casual partner for 60% not living with a spouse and 26% living with a spouse (P<0.005). Two or more partners during the past year were reported by 82% of men and 25% of women (P <0.001), and 55% of men and 11% of women reported the last partner was high risk. HIV seropositivity among both genders was associated with numbers of partners, and among women, with being widowed or divorced. Only 3% reported use of a condom with the last partner. Among men whose last sex was with a FSW, 74% said the reason for not using a condom was not having one. Thus, infrequent condom use, low condom availability, and gender differences in behaviour necessitate modifying development policies that separate families; and better coordination between family planning, PHC, and AIDS/STD programmes, with improved supply, social marketing and community-based distribution of condoms in high-risk settings for STD/HIV prevention.

AB OBJECTIVES: Music videos from five genres of music were analyzed for portrayals of tobacco and alcohol use and for portrayals of such behaviors in conjunction with sexuality.; METHODS: Music videos (n = 518) were recorded during randomly selected days and times from four television networks. Four female and four male observers aged 17 to 24 years were trained to use a standardized content analysis instrument. All videos were observed by rotating two-person, male-female teams who were required to reach agreement on each behavior that was scored. Music genre and network differences in behaviors were analyzed with chi-squared tests.; RESULTS: A higher percentage (25.7%) of MTV videos than other network videos portrayed tobacco use. The percentage of videos showing alcohol use was similar on all four networks. In videos that portrayed tobacco and alcohol use, the lead performer was most often the one smoking or drinking and the use of alcohol was associated with a high degree of sexuality on all the videos.; CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that even modest levels of viewing may result in substantial exposure to glamorized depictions of alcohol and tobacco use and alcohol use coupled with sexuality.

   India, in 1994 compared awareness of AIDS.  84.48% of urban and 90.39%
   of rural students agreed that the sex education they received in school
   was inadequate.  AIDS was identified as an infectious disease by 67.24%
   of urban and 63.36% of rural students.  Modes of HIV transmission
   identified by urban and rural girls, respectively, included: use of
   unsterilized needles for injection (81.03% and 25.0%), drinking from the
   same glass as an infected person (6.89% and 17.3%), sex with an infected

   12.07% of urban students and 55.77% of their rural counterparts believed
   there is a cure for AIDS.  The main sources of information about AIDS
   for urban and rural students, respectively, were: newspaper articles
   (56.89% and 21.15%), television (62.07% and 50.00%), magazine articles
   (34.49% and 9.62%), conversations with friends (25.89% and 11.54%), and

   although these secondary school students had acquired information about
   AIDS from a variety of sources, much of this information was inaccurate.
   There is a need for school-based sex education programs to deepen
   students' knowledge of HIV/AIDS.

AB BACKGROUND: Prevention and control of disease and injury require information about the leading medical causes of illness and exposures or risk factors. The assessment of the public-health importance of these has been hampered by the lack of common methods to investigate the overall, worldwide burden. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) provides a standardised approach to epidemiological assessment and uses a standard unit, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to aid comparisons.; METHODS: DALYs for each age-sex group in each GBD region for 107 disorders were calculated, based on the estimates of mortality by cause, incidence, average age of onset, duration, and disability severity. Estimates of the burden and prevalence of exposure in different regions of disorders attributable to malnutrition, poor water supply, sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene, unsafe sex, tobacco use, alcohol, occupation, hypertension, physical inactivity, use of illicit drugs, and air pollution were developed.; FINDINGS: Developed regions account for 11.6% of the worldwide burden from all causes of death and disability, and account for 90.2% of health expenditure worldwide. Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders explain 43.9%; non-communicable causes 40.9%; injuries 15.1%; malignant neoplasms 5.1%; neuropsychiatric conditions 10.5%; and cardiovascular conditions 9.7% of DALYs worldwide. The ten leading specific causes of global DALYs are, in descending order, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, perinatal disorders, unipolar major depression, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, measles, road-traffic accidents, and congenital anomalies. 15.9% of DALYs worldwide are attributable to childhood malnutrition and 6.8% to poor water, and sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene.; INTERPRETATION: The three leading contributors to the burden of disease are communicable and perinatal disorders affecting children. The substantial burdens of neuropsychiatric disorders and injuries are under-recognised. The epidemiological transition in terms of DALYs has progressed substantially in China, Latin America and the Caribbean, other Asia and islands, and the middle eastern crescent. If the burdens of disability and death are taken into account, our list differs substantially from other lists of the leading causes of death. DALYs provide a common metric to aid meaningful comparison of the burden of risk factors, diseases, and injuries. 
A2 The Global Burden of Disease Study used the disability-adjusted
   life-year (DALY) to compare death and disability from various disorders
   in developing and developed countries.  In 1990, developing countries
   carried almost 90% of the global disease burden yet were recipients of
   only 10% of global health care funding.  The highest disease burdens
   were in sub-Saharan Africa (21.4% of global total) and India (20.9%). 
   Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders (group 1
   causes) predominated in sub-Saharan Africa (65.9% of burden), while
   noncommunicable diseases (group 2 causes) accounted for 80% of the
   burden in established market economies; injuries (group 3) did not
   differ substantially across regions.  The ratio of group 2 to group 1
   disorders can be used as a measure of the epidemiologic transition. 
   Group 2 disorders already surpass group 1 disorders in China, Latin
   America, and the Caribbean.  On a global level, group 1, 2, and 3 causes
   accounted for 43.9%, 40.9%, and 15.1%, respectively, of DALYs.  Overall,
   the top 3 causes of DALYs in 1990 were lower respiratory infections,
   diarrheal diseases, and perinatal disorders (low birth weight and birth
   asphyxia or birth trauma).  In developed countries, these causes were
   ischemic heart disease, unipolar major depression, and cerebrovascular
   diseases.  Malnutrition was the risk factor responsible for the greatest
   loss of DALYs (15.9%), followed by poor water supply, sanitation, and
   personal hygiene (6.8%).

AB This article presents baseline data on the opinion toward alcohol beverage warning labels and on levels of knowledge of the risks discussed in the contents of the labels prior to the labels' introduction, and on levels of knowledge of additional alcohol-related hazards not included in the proposed warning labels, among a sample of 3065 adolescents of four religions living in the northern region of Israel. About 2220 Arab participants (Moslems, Christians and Druze) and 845 Jewish respondents answered in the winter of 1996 a Hebrew version of an American questionnaire, which had been used to measure levels of knowledge of the label in the United States. More respondents were in favour of warning labels on alcohol containers than on advertisements. Arabs as a group were more in favour of warning labels on alcohol containers than Jews. The initial knowledge levels among the participants were not very high, especially concerning the item 'Drinking impairs the ability to operate machinery' (74.4%) which is included on the proposed warning label, and concerning two hazards which are not included: 'Drinking increases risk of cancer' (54.6%) and 'Drinking increases risk of high blood pressure' (60.4%). Abstainers knew more than drinkers that 'Pregnant women should not drink', 'Drinking increases risk of cancer' and 'Alcohol in combination with other drugs is hazardous'. Implications for public health are discussed and alternative warning messages that might be used to inform the Israeli public of several less well-known hazards are suggested.

AB PURPOSE: To advocate strategies to promote the health of young people that include action to create supportive social and economic conditions, alongside more traditional actions to strengthen individual capacity to protect health.; METHODS: Analysis of different strategies for youth health promotion from different countries, including education, public policies, laws, and regulations that protect young people from exploitation and physical harm, and enhance their capacity to make healthy lifestyle choices.; RESULTS: Access to education and the promotion of basic literacy are, in their own right, important public health goals. Beyond this, efforts to promote health through schools should focus on the creation of an integrated and mutually reinforcing set of experiences for young people, including classroom health education, the creation of a safe and healthy physical environment, and provision of appropriate school health services. The creation of supportive social and economic conditions are also essential, and require political action through the development of public policy. Such policies include restricting access to tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs, improving access to essential health services; and regulation of economic exploitation of young people.; CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion is inherently political. Health professionals have to find ways to become more effective political advocates for young people. This should be reflected in the education of health professionals and educators, and in the work of agencies and professional associations. 
A2 Strategies from different countries for youth health promotion were
   analyzed.  These strategies include measures in education, public
   policies, laws, and regulations which protect young people from
   exploitation and physical harm, and enhance their capacity to make

   and requires political action through the development of public policy. 
   Such policies include restricting access to tobacco, alcohol, and

AB The purpose of this study was to compare response distributions in health surveys for two interview modes: face-to-face household interviews and telephone interviews. There were two samples of the Perth metropolitan general population aged 16 to 69 years: a face-to-face household sample (n = 1000) and a telephone sample (n = 222). The samples were generated by probability-based methods commonly used by commercial market research organisations. The surveys occurred in August-September 1992 as part of a larger statewide survey component of a three-year evaluation of the Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation. Respondents were drawn from a two-stage cluster sample based on private dwellings for personal interviews, and from randomly selected listed and unlisted private numbers for telephone interviews. Although the samples did not differ significantly on a number of variables, the telephone sample was significantly higher in residential social status; there was significantly lower reporting of smoking and lower unsafe alcohol consumption in the telephone sample: significantly higher proportions of the telephone sample were in Prochaska's 'action' stage of change for several health behaviours; and there was significantly greater recall of health messages in the telephone sample. Health researchers should treat comparisons between different survey modes with caution, and should be aware that campaign evaluations using telephone surveys and household surveys may yield substantially different results.

AB In a senior high school in the Weicheng District of Weifang City, we studied the health of a total 445 students. The age of the first emission was 15.22 +/- 2.24 years, and the age of menarche was 13.56 +/- 2.26 years. Because 47.9% of boys and 63.8% of girls did not have previous knowledge about puberty, 39.9% of boys and 52.2% of girls felt puzzled and disgusted with the onset of puberty. About 18% of boys and about 2% of girls reported masturbation. The average frequency of masturbation was 3.5 times a month in the boys and two times monthly in girls. Adolescents acquired sexual knowledge and information predominantly from magazines (25.8% of boys and 28.0% of girls). About 64% of boys and 44% of girls wanted to be given educational programs on sex. About 43% of boys and 1% of girls smoked cigarettes and 83.5% of boys and 54.9% of girls drank alcohol. The survey suggested that it is essential to teach the senior high school students about the psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of adolescence and promote research on adolescent medicine. 
A2 163 male and 282 female students aged 10-18 years during 1993-94 at a
   senior high school in the Weicheng District of Weifang City completed
   questionnaires on their sex-related knowledge and behavior.  41% of boys
   and 10% of girls did not answer the question on age at first semen
   emission and menarche, respectively.  However, of those who did respond
   to the question, the mean age at first emission was 15.22 years and the
   age of menarche was 13.56 years.  34% of boys and 25% of girls were
   confused by the onset of puberty; 47.9% of all boys and 63.8% of all
   girls had no previous knowledge of puberty.  Approximately 18% of boys
   and 2% of girls reported masturbation, although 20% and 18% of the
   entire sample, respectively, provided no response to the question on
   masturbation.  The boys and girls who admitted to masturbating did so an
   average of 3.5 and 2 times per month, respectively.  Masturbation has
   long been considered an obscene, sinful behavior in China.  All
   participants denied having sexual intercourse.  25.8% of boys and 28.0%
   of girls acquired their sexual knowledge and information from magazines,
   and 64% of boys and 44% of girls wanted educational programs on sex. 
   43% of boys and 1% of girls smoked cigarettes and 83.5% of boys and

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the appeal of "designer drinks" to young people.; DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative research comprising group discussions and questionnaire led interviews with young people accompanied by a self completion questionnaire.; SETTINGS: Argyll and Clyde Health Board area, west Scotland.; SUBJECTS: Eight groups aged 12-17 years; 824 aged 12-17 recruited by multistage cluster probability sample from the community health index.; RESULTS: Young people were familiar with designer drinks, especially MD 20/20 and leading brands of strong white cider. Attitudes towards these drinks varied quite distinctly with age, clearly reflecting their attitudes towards and motivations for drinking in general. The brand imagery of designer drinks-in contrast with that of more mainstream drinks-matched many 14 and 15 year olds' perceptions and expectations of drinking. Popularity of designer drinks peaked between the ages of 13 and 16 while more conventional drinks showed a consistent increase in popularity with age. Consumption of designer drinks tended to be in less controlled circumstances and was associated with heavier alcohol intake and greater drunkenness.; CONCLUSIONS: Designer drinks are a cause for concern. They appeal to young people, often more so than conventional drinks, and are particularly attractive to 14-16 year olds. Consumption of designer drinks is also associated with drinking in less controlled environments, heavier drinking, and greater drunkenness. There is a need for policy debate to assess the desirability of these drinks and the extent to which further controls on their marketing are required.

AB PURPOSE: Guided by information processing theory and the health belief model, this paper considers the relationship between health consciousness among the general population and attention to environmental health warnings about alcohol consumption. Mechanisms of exposure to three dominant types of impersonal alcohol-related health messages in the environment are explored.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey using telephone interview data.; SUBJECTS: A representative nationwide sample of adults was interviewed in 1993 (n = 1026), with a response rate of 63%.; MEASURES: Key variables include exposure to warning labels on alcoholic beverages, to point-of-sale posters, and to advertisements in the media, as well as respondents' alcohol consumption, health problems (indicative of salience of health warnings), and level of health consciousness assessed by items tapping concern with nutrition and seeking information on health topics.; RESULTS: In the total sample, over a third had seen a warning label or poster and almost all had seen an advertisement about the risks associated with alcohol consumption in 1993. Survey respondents scored very high on five individual items that make up the health consciousness scale introduced here, with 69% endorsing all items. The scale demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha = .70) and was significantly correlated (p < .01) with not enjoying getting drunk and with usually reading product warning labels, suggesting construct validity. Yet the hypothesized strong relationships between health consciousness and attention to health warnings about drinking were not observed; nor was salience of messages a predictor of recall. Importantly, high proportions of underage drinkers and young adults at elevated risk for drinking problems are reached by container warning label messages. Mechanisms of exposure recall vary based on message source, with "container label recall" associated with heavier drinking, younger age, and purchasing patterns; "poster recall" associated with purchasing and health consciousness; and "advertisement recall" associated with heavy consumption and younger age.; CONCLUSIONS: These results are contrary to predictions from skeptics of broad-based informational interventions, who argue that only the already-health conscious are attentive to health warnings about the risks of alcohol consumption. These data suggest that the label is reaching intended target audiences, especially younger people, males, and heavier alcohol consumers. Future research in predicting attention to impersonal health warnings in the environment should continue to improve the assessment of constructs such as salience and health consciousness, and should further test the applicability of available theoretical models. Subsequent research should also consider additional measures to tap mechanisms of exposure to impersonal health messages to enable a better understanding of the population that is not being reached by such public health interventions.

AB Previous investigations of risk behaviors among high-school students in the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, revealed a high prevalence of binge drinking among boys. Qualitative methods were used to identify and gain insights into the social context of alcohol misuse in male adolescents. Two focus groups were held with eight adolescent binge drinkers. The content of the discussions were analyzed using the grounded theory method. Three key findings emerged. First, adolescents drink because they derive benefits from the use or misuse of alcohol, such as increased self-confidence and adult status. Factors which facilitate the use of alcohol include the alleviation of boredom, experimentation, peer pressure, and parental influences. Second, participants attributed negative characteristics to teetotallers such as being conservative and immature. Binge drinkers were attributed negative characteristics such as lacking self-control and self-respect. Moderate drinkers were attributed with positive characteristics such as being mature and socially adept. Finally, the influential role of alcohol promoting advertising was highlighted. Although participants minimized the effects of advertising it was clear that it played a role in their perception of themselves and of their peers especially with respect to drinking behaviors. The findings suggest some useful prevention strategies among adolescent males at risk for alcohol misuse.

AB The purposes of this study were to examine the prevalence of gambling among youth, compare rates of gambling between 1992 and 1995, and determine what levels of gambling frequency may be considered common and uncommon. The two samples included 122,700 Minnesota public school students in the 6th, 9th, and 12th grades in 1992; and 75,900 9th and 12th grade students in 1995. Students were administered the Minnesota Student Survey, a 126-item, anonymous, self-administered, paper-and-pencil questionnaire that inquires about multiple content domains, including gambling behaviors. The same questionnaire, with minor revisions to the gambling items, was administered in both 1992 and 1995 to students in their classrooms by the Minnesota Department of Education. There were slight decreases in overall gambling rates from 1992 to 1995. The majority of students gambled at least once during the past year. However, most did not play any game on a weekly/daily rate and did not report any problems associated with their gambling. Gender, grade, and race effects were found for gambling frequency. Boys gambled more often than girls, and 9th and 12th grade students gambled more often than 6th grade students. Asian American and White students reported lower rates of gambling frequency than Mexican/Latin American, African American, and American Indian students. From a statistical standpoint (i.e., beyond the 97.7 percentile), it may be considered in the uncommon range for girls to play two or more games at a weekly/daily rate, and for boys to play four or more games at a weekly/daily rate. Variables associated with gambling frequency included antisocial behavior, gender, and alcohol use frequency. Although the finding that gambling did not increase from 1992 to 1995 is encouraging, this is the first generation of youth to be exposed to widespread accessibility to gambling venues and gambling advertising and it will be important to continue monitoring the prevalence of youth gambling.

A2 In Viet Nam, the 1990 designation of population as a top government
   concern resulted in a tenfold increase in spending on family planning
   (FP) and health.  The Viet Nam FP Association has developed a number of
   innovative ways of promoting FP, including a telephone counseling
   service.  The population of Viet Nam has doubled since 1960, and the
   average per capita income remains very low; thus, condoms and oral
   contraceptives (OCs) are prohibitively expensive for many families.  The
   FP program provides free condoms, OCs, and IUDs but often runs out of
   supplies.  Need for condoms is estimated at 200 million/year, but the
   two factories only produce 30 million.  OCs are imported from Hungary
   and have a bad reputation among Vietnamese women.  The most commonly
   used contraceptive is the IUD, but poor quality of care at insertion
   leads many women to suffer infections.  Viet Nam has a high rate of
   legal abortion, with most procedures occurring in the first month of
   pregnancy.  The FP Association has cautiously introduced sex education
   in the schools in a pilot program that will be continued nationwide. 
   The Association also opened a special club for young people and one for
   miliary personnel.  These clubs provide contraceptive information along
   with soft drinks and music.  The government's two-child policy is widely
   accepted but must overcome the obstacles of large family preference in
   rural areas and of son preference.

AB There are a number of sources of variability in food consumption patterns and residue levels of a particular chemical (e.g., pesticide, food additive) in commodities that lead to an expected high level of variability in dietary exposures across a population. This paper focuses on examples of consumption pattern survey data for specific commodities, namely that for wine and grape juice, and demonstrates how such data might be analyzed in preparation for performing stochastic analyses of dietary exposure. Data from the NIAAA/NHIS wine consumption survey were subset for gender and age group and, with matched body weight data from the survey database, were used to define empirically-based percentile estimates for wine intake (microliter wine/kg body weight) for the strata of interest. The data for these two subpopulations were analyzed to estimate 14-day consumption distributional statistics and distributions for only those days on which wine was consumed. Data subsets for all wine-consuming adults and wine-consuming females ages 18 through 45, were determined to fit a lognormal distribution (R2 = 0.99 for both datasets). Market share data were incorporated into estimation of chronic exposures to hypothetical chemical residues in imported table wine. As a separate example, treatment of grape juice consumption data for females, ages 18-40, as a simple lognormal distribution resulted in a significant underestimation of intake, and thus exposure, because the actual distribution is a mixture (i.e., multiple subpopulations of grape juice consumers exist in the parent distribution). Thus, deriving dietary intake statistics from food consumption survey data requires careful analysis of the underlying empirical distributions.

AB It was the aim of the present study to evaluate how adolescents in Germany accept and consume the new caffeinated drinks (NCD), which can now be legally marketed in Germany. In summer and fall 1994, three surveys were carried out at different schools in Germany, (Aachen, Cologne, Wuppertal, Berlin-West and Berlin-Ost). 1,265 boys and girls were asked for acquaintance with NCD (module I) and 875 of them about consumption (module II). With 727 pupils a third question (module III) was applied by which consumption of Cola drinks compared to that of NCD could be quantified. In total, 93.6% of the young people indicated to know about the NCD, and 53.3% to have tasted these new drinks. Consumption was reported as sometimes (< 1 can/week) from 23% and as repeatedly (1-7 cans/week) from 3%. Acquaintance and consumption were clearly related to age and gender, but even the youngest group (10-13 years old) indicated to have tasted the NCD (30.7% in females and 50% in males) and to drink them sometimes (5.2% in females and 23.1% in males). In the series with question module III 9.5% reported not to drink cola, 36.6% to drink cola "sometimes", 30.9% "repeatedly", 8.6% "often" and 11.6% "frequently" (> 2 cans/day). The corresponding figures for the NCD were 69.9% (non-drinkers), 23.3% "sometimes", 3.3% "repeatedly", 0.3% ten nd 0.6% "frequently". The results suggest that all young people in Germany know about the NCD but actually consume these new drinks moderately. They prefer cola drinks. The observation, however, that a small group may consume extreme amounts and that even very young pupils consume the NCD regularly should give rise to have a close look at the consumption pattern in the near future.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study examined the associations between physical activity and other health behaviors in a representative sample of US adolescents.; METHODS: In the 1990 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 11631 high school students provided information on physical activity; diet; substance use; and other negative health behaviors. Logistic regression analyses examined associations between physical activity and other health behaviors in a subset of 2652 high-active and 1641 low-active students.; RESULTS: Low activity was associated with cigarette smoking, marijuana use, lower fruit and vegetable consumption, greater television watching, failure to wear a seat belt, and low perception of academic performance. For consumption of fruit, television watching, and alcohol consumption, significant interactions were found with race/ethnicity or sex, suggesting that sociocultural factors may affect the relationships between physical activity and some health behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: Low physical activity was associated with several other negative health behaviors in teenagers. Future studies should examine whether interventions for increasing physical activity in youth can be effective in reducing negative health behaviors.

AB PURPOSE: Educators and producers should take advantage of television's potential for reaching audiences with health-related messages. This paper investigates adolescents' perceptions of an anti-alcohol message embedded in commercial television programming.; METHODS: Over 900 8th and 9th graders from New York suburbs completed surveys measuring interest, knowledge, and credibility of either an episode of The Cosby Show or Family Matters. Both episodes had an anti-alcohol message embedded within their plots.; RESULTS: Overall, students gave high rates of interest and credibility and received high scores for knowledge for both episodes. Girls and African-American students had higher scores, on average, for interest and credibility. White students had the highest knowledge scores. Students with different television viewing experiences did not differ in their perceptions of the episodes; however, students who had previously seen the episodes gave higher levels of interest and credibility.; CONCLUSION: These data indicate that youngsters are receptive to antialcohol messages within commercial television episodes. The results also suggest that similarities and differences between a viewer and a televised character relate to differences in perception. However, much more research should be done in order to generalize these findings to other audiences, episodes, programs, and health-related messages.

AB The purpose of this paper was to analyse the role of social class concerning changes in alcohol consumption and severe alcohol-related problems from the end of the 1960s to the 1990s in Stockholm County, and in the whole of Sweden for consumption. Survey data showed that the prevalence of moderate and/or high alcohol consumption in adults of both sexes was highest among non-manual employees at medium and high level, in 1967 as well as in 1980 in the whole of Sweden. After 1980, an equalization occurred. A similar change in the social class pattern of alcohol consumption was noted in young people. We analysed all 36,404 male and 10,648 female hospitalizations and all the 3175 male and 713 female deaths with a diagnosis of alcoholism, alcohol psychosis or alcohol intoxication in Stockholm County during 1970-86 (1970-84 for mortality) linked to individual census data. There was a greater increase in rates among women than among men, especially among women outside the labour market. We found pronounced social class differences between manual and non-manual employees, which widened up to 1986 (1984 for mortality)-a period with an initial increase and a subsequent decrease in alcohol consumption. Thus, the changes in consumption and alcohol-related problems developed differently in principal social classes over time, suggesting that an expanded theory on alcohol consumption in the population should take socio-economic factors into account.

AB Self Enhancement, Inc., is a grassroots, community-service organization working in the most disadvantaged high-risk community in Portland, Oregon. Its violence-prevention program targets middle-school and high-school students by providing classroom and community activities to these young people. These activities are designed to enhance protective factors and build resilience in youths to enable them to attain healthy and productive lives and to resist the threats of gangs, violence, and drugs. RMC Research Corporation works in partnership with Self Enhancement, Inc., to conduct research and evaluation on the effectiveness of its programs. The Self Enhancement, Inc., program works primarily at the individual student and interpersonal relationship levels. Resilience Theory and its culturally specific Relationship Model drive the formulation of specific strategies and activities. Program staff mentor each student through his or her preadolescent and adolescent years, promoting positive, prosocial norms and expectations for behavior through their peer group activities. The Self Enhancement, Inc., program consists of three major components: classroom, exposure, and proactive education. Classroom education focuses on anger management, conflict resolution, and problem solving. Exposure education consists of quarterly field trips to agencies and organizations in the Portland area that deal with the causes and consequences of violence in the community. Proactive education includes newsletters, student-run assemblies and conferences, and radio/ television public service announcements that communicate antiviolence messages. The evaluation plan is a longitudinal matched comparison group designed to assess the outcomes of the violence-prevention program. Key outcomes are protective factors, health-risk behaviors, and academic measures. Standardized assessment instruments (the Individual Protective Factors Index and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey) were administered to all students during winter 1994. The instruments will be readministered during the same period in the following two years of the project. School records were extracted to assess students' attendance and progress through their academic programs. Of the 326 seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-grade students participating in this study, 95% are African Americans and 51% are boys. The prevalence of fighting (56%) during the past 12 months is higher than that among African-American high-school students nationally, but weapon carrying (27%), alcohol use (30%), and marijuana use (18%) are the same or lower than national averages for this group. All baseline indicators are equivalent between the program and comparison groups with the exception of weapon carrying. Program students report carrying weapons more than do their comparison group counterparts. Baseline indicators of violence-related behaviors clearly indicate the need for intervention in this highly disadvantaged, African-American community. Through its historical presence and recent program development efforts, Self Enhancement, Inc., is well positioned to make a difference in the lives of these young people. The equivalence of program and comparison group students on baseline indicators of violence bodes well for an unequivocal assessment of program effectiveness over time.

AB In Japan, the mean DMFT at 12 years of age increased from 2.8 in 1957 to 5.9 in 1975. From the 1981 survey (DMFT = 5.43), conversely, the mean DMFT decreased and reached 3.64 in 1993. The increase in caries prevalence can, without doubt, be explained by an increment of sugar consumption, since the intake of sugar increased after World War II and exceeded 18.25 kg/year (50 g/day) in 1965 and reached a maximum value (29.3 kg/year) in 1973 in Japan. On the other hand, the reason why the DMFT has decreased since 1981 is not clear. In many industrialized countries, a caries reduction has been achieved with acceptable fluoride exposure, although sugar consumption was still at a high level. However, fluoride usage was still limited during the last 2 decades in Japan. There is no community where fluoridated drinking water has been supplied since 1972. Fluoride tablet use was also discontinued for children in the 1970s. Fluoride mouthrinsing programs were available for only 1% of school children in 1992. Moreover, the market share of fluoridated dentifrices stayed at 10% until 1986 and became 30% only in 1988. An excellent correlation (r = 0.91; P < 0.01) is observed between the DMFT in 12-year-olds and per capita sugar consumption per year between 1957 and 1987 in Japan.

AB This article describes one effort to help prevent violence against women by addressing some of the larger societal factors involved. The Dangerous Promises campaign is based on the premise that sexist advertising images contribute to an environment conducive to violence against women. The goal of the campaign is to convince alcohol companies to eliminate sexist alcohol advertising and promotions. Using the tools of community organizing and media advocacy, the campaign pressures the alcohol industry to change the ways in which they portray women in much of their advertising. Media advocacy has been instrumental in the successes of the campaign. This article examines the strategies and outcomes of the Dangerous Promises efforts to date and makes a case for application of media advocacy as a tool for increasing community voice in policy-making processes.

AB This is the first round in a series of surveys conducted in Fort McMurray as part of the Fort McMurray Demonstration Project in social marketing. This component of the survey was intended to focus on the most prominent group of employed workers in the community and to compare their patterns of response with the community as a whole. Respondents to the survey were overwhelmingly male (96%), married (72.9%) and living in households of two to five persons (87.9%). They were predominantly aged 30-44 (55%) and graduates of high school (53.5%). Younger male workers (below age 30) were more likely to have a high school diploma (78.3%) or some additional technical or vocational training (21.7% compared to 12.5% overall) and to be unmarried or separated. Attitudes toward safety-related behaviours were stronger than for respondents from the community as a whole. Approximately 70-100% of all age groups and both sexes showed strong agreement with attitudes involving child car seats and the unacceptability of drinking and driving. These attitudes include strong advocacy of vigorous enforcement of occupational health and safety standards. However, they showed a variability similar to the community as a whole in behaviour at home compared to work, generally reporting more consistent use of personal protection on the job than in their own homes, particularly hearing protection. Even so, they were much less likely to perform stretching and warm-up exercises prior to exertion than community residents in general. The potential may exist to transfer the technology and attitudes from workplace health and safety to community safety. One possible strategy to accomplish this is to involve workers in this industry directly in community initiatives. This strategy may be generalizable to any community in which there are major employers who place a heavy emphasis on risk control and occupational health and safety.

AB The first year of the mandatory bicycle helmet laws in Australia saw increased helmet wearing from 31% to 75% of cyclists in Victoria and from 31% of children and 26% of adults in New South Wales (NSW) to 76% and 85%. However, the two major surveys using matched before and after samples in Melbourne (Finch et al. 1993; Report No. 45, Monash Univ. Accident Research Centre) and throughout NSW (Smith and Milthorpe 1993; Roads and Traffic Authority) observed reductions in numbers of child cyclists 15 and 2.2 times greater than the increase in numbers of children wearing helmets. This suggests the greatest effect of the helmet law was not to encourage cyclists to wear helmets, but to discourage cycling. In contrast, despite increases to at least 75% helmet wearing, the proportion of head injuries in cyclists admitted or treated at hospital declined by an average of only 13%. The percentage of cyclists with head injuries after collisions with motor vehicles in Victoria declined by more, but the proportion of head injured pedestrians also declined; the two followed a very similar trend. These trends may have been caused by major road safety initiatives introduced at the same time as the helmet law and directed at both speeding and drink-driving. The initiatives seem to have been remarkably effective in reducing road trauma for all road users, perhaps affecting the proportions of victims suffering head injuries as well as total injuries. The benefits of cycling, even without a helmet, have been estimated to outweigh the hazards by a factor of 20 to 1 (Hillman 1993. Cycle helmets-the case for and against. Policy Studies Institute, London). Consequently, a helmet law, whose most notable effect was to reduce cycling, may have generated a net loss of health benefits to the nation. Despite the risk of dying from head injury per hour being similar for unhelmeted cyclists and motor vehicle occupants, cyclists alone have been required to wear head protection. Helmets for motor vehicle occupants are now being marketed and a mandatory helmet law for these road users has the potential to save 17 times as many people from death by head injury as a helmet law for cyclists without the adverse effects of discouraging a healthy and pollution free mode of transport.

AB This article examines how teenagers perceive a show that is both educational and entertaining. In classrooms, 970 students viewed and evaluated one of two videos of a commercial television program featuring an anti-alcohol message. Overall, the sample assessed the programs favorably, finding the messages interesting, credible and understandable. Firsthand experience with alcohol predicted variations in the perception of an anti-alcohol message, while contact with others who use alcohol did not. Regression analysis showed personal experience with alcohol had a strong relationship to interest, a modest relationship to credibility, but no significant relationship to knowledge. In contrast, social contact with those who use alcohol often (i.e. knowing friends and family members who drink) was not significantly associated with the perceptions of an alcohol message on television. Such results suggest that those creating and using mass-media health messages effectively must be aware of the actual firsthand experiences of their audiences.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether differences in perceived riskiness of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to self-reported alcohol consumption among a community sample of pregnant women. Further, this study examined the impact of prior experiences on risk perceptions, focusing on previous pregnancy experiences and on previous alcohol-related problems.; METHOD: The hypothesized relationships among variables were tested simultaneously in a structural equation model. Subjects included 159 pregnant women, all of whom drank regularly before pregnancy recognition, who were recruited from prenatal clinics and through newspaper advertisements.; RESULTS: Perceived riskiness of drinking during pregnancy was lower among women who had previously given birth to a healthy child and among women with greater numbers of previous alcohol problems. Prior adverse pregnancy experience did not predict perceived risk. Perceived risk negatively predicted actual alcohol consumption during pregnancy, suggesting that previous healthy pregnancy experiences and alcohol problems increase drinking in pregnancy indirectly, through perceived risk. A direct positive effect from previous alcohol problems to drinking in pregnancy also was observed.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that risk perceptions play a role in drinking behavior among pregnant women and help to illuminate the relationship between parity and alcohol consumption. Interventions designed to reduce drinking among pregnant women, which have generally relied on providing information, may be improved by considering the impact of previous experiences and addressing erroneous beliefs.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examines white male adolescent responses to TV beer advertisements with and without sports content and to nonbeer ads when embedded in sports and entertainment programming.; METHOD: A total of 72 advertisements and 24 television program excerpts were randomly sampled from national television programming. White male adolescents (N = 157) recruited in a public school system each viewed six ads (one of each of three types of ad embedded in each of two types of programming) comprising the 2 x 2 x 3 factorial, within-subjects, mixed-model (random and fixed effects) experimental design along with an age-level blocking factor and random factors for commercial and program stimuli. Cognitive responses to each ad were content-analyzed. Individual difference variables including alcohol use behavior, sensation-seeking, masculinity and sports involvement were also measured.; RESULTS: Subjects showed a consistent preference for beer ads with sports content. A significant three-way interaction between ad type, programming type and junior versus senior high-school age level also indicated that sports programming had an inconsistent effect on responses to beer ads but that nonbeer ads were responded to more positively during sports than during entertainment programming. Other analyses showed that subjects were more cognitively resistant to beer ads than to nonbeer ads.; CONCLUSIONS: These results support public and official concerns that sports content in beer ads increase the ads appeal to underage youth. They do not support hypothesized concerns that sports programming might prime adolescents to be more receptive to beer ads. Implications for alcohol education efforts are discussed.

The coverage rates of the information concerning smoking and drinking were 97.3% and 92.5%, respectively. Television, newspapers and magazines were the major sources of health information concerning smoking and drinking. In addition, men who gave up or controlled smoking or drinking usually obtained health information from doctors, while those who had never controlled smoking usually obtained health information from their friends and families. Men who could not control drinking effectively usually obtained health information from the health examination consultant at the workplace. However, according to the answers from men who gave up or controlled drinking, the health information useful in changing health behavior was obtained from the health examination consultant at the workplace and from persons who had a disease history. Women who gave up or controlled drinking answered that the health information from their friends and families was helpful to change the health behavior.

AB The study is aimed to assess the existing level of knowledge of school children of 9th and 10th classes about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Three high schools in an urban area and three in the villages of a district of North India were included in the study. A pretested closed-ended questionnaire was administered to 336 students available. Overall level of knowledge about AIDS was found to be high. However, there were significant differences in knowledge among rural-urban and male-female students. There were some misconceptions in knowledge regarding transmission, prognosis and prevention. Books and media were the most common sources of information. Most of the students wanted to learn more about AIDS. Since overall knowledge levels were high we conclude that AIDS education should concentrate on clarifying areas of misconceptions. 
A2 To assess current levels of knowledge about AIDS among secondary school
   students in India, a questionnaire was administered to 336 ninth and
   tenth graders (mean age, 15 years) in three rural and three urban
   schools in Haryana State's Ambala District in 1993.  A brief paragraph
   on HIV/AIDS is included in textbooks for ninth and tenth graders in
   Haryana.  85% of students had heard of AIDS; of these, 56% cited sex
   with an infected partner as a means of HIV transmission and 38%
   identified use of unsterilized drug-injecting equipment.  Sexual
   monogamy (49%), condom use (44%), and use of sterilized needles (40%)
   were the main strategies identified for prevention of HIV transmission. 
   Of concern was widespread misinformation about HIV transmission and
   control.  For example, 23% of students believed HIV can be transmitted
   by drinking from a glass used by an infected person and 22% thought
   mosquito bites spread the virus.  57% believed persons with AIDS can be
   detected by their physical appearance and 38% considered AIDS to be a
   treatable disease.  The most popular sources of knowledge were textbooks
   (51%), television (50%), and newspapers (34%).  Urban students were
   significantly more informed about AIDS than their rural counterparts. 
   Since textbooks are an important source of information in this
   population, it is recommended that the current paragraph on AIDS be
   expanded to a separate chapter on AIDS and other sexually transmitted
   diseases.  In addition, state medical officers are urged to deliver
   talks on AIDS during routine school health examinations.

AB BACKGROUND: This paper describes the results of an AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors survey of a random sample of heterosexual California adults.; METHODS: The study was conducted from August 1990 until February 1991 and consisted of telephone interviews conducted in English and Spanish, with a household probability sample of 3,545 California adults, undersampling those age 44 and older.; RESULTS: Approximately one-third of the sample believed that HIV/AIDS is contracted by donating blood, and 20% believed the infection could result from insect bites. Tolerance toward HIV-infected persons was highest among young, male, white, employed individuals with higher levels of education and income. Twenty-seven percent of males and 14% of females were categorized as high risk based on the presence of at least 1 of 7 risk factors. High-risk respondents tended to be male, young, employed, never married, U.S. born, and English speaking. Compared to low-risk respondents, they were less likely to use condoms and more likely to use alcohol and drugs in conjunction with sex. Most common sources of AIDS information were television, newspapers, and magazines.; CONCLUSIONS: More strenuous efforts are needed to reach young adults, especially those beyond college age, with AIDS prevention messages. Creative messages via popular media venues should be explored.
