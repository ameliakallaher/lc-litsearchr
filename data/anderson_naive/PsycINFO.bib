  Abstract = {Examines the roles that TV alcohol portrayals and alcohol advertising play in the subsequent drinking patterns of adolescents. In general, TV presents drinking as a problem-free activity that is only rarely associated with any consequences, good or bad. Drinking characters tend to be wealthy, upper class, in managerial or professional occupations, and familiar to viewers. Young people tend to model behavior associated with such status symbols as wealth and happiness. Content analyses of alcohol advertisements show that the advertisements link drinking with highly valued personal attributes such as sociability, elegance, and physical attractiveness, and with desirable outcomes such as success, relaxation, romance, and adventure. Previous studies (e.g., C. K. Atkin and M. Block, 1981) on the effects of alcohol advertising and young people indicate that alcohol advertising may predispose youths toward drinking.

  Abstract = {Studied the relationship between the recency of exposure to alcohol education programs and actual participation in discussion specifically regarding alcohol advertising on cognitive resistance to TV beer advertisements among 83 adolescents (aged 12–18 yrs). A correlational field study consisted of a total presentation of 36 advertisements (18 beer and 18 nonbeer advertisements), 9 situation comedies and 9 sports programs in constructing 18 separate sets of stimuli. Results showed that the recency of exposure to alcohol education classes and discussion of alcohol advertising in such classes predicts cognitive resistance (counterarguing) of such advertisements months or even years after class exposure. Age, gender, and ethnicity were statistically controlled. While females tended to counterargue the alcohol advertisements more than did males, there was no statistically significant difference in the impact of education on males and females.

Abstract = {Investigated the relationships between adolescents' level of susceptibility to substance use and their recognition and liking for tobacco and alcohol advertising. 386 8th grade students (13–16 yrs old) viewed pictures of advertisements with obscured brand names and identifying information. Ss then identified the brand name and type of product being advertised, and rated their liking for each. Their alcohol and smoking use status and susceptibility were assessed using the Project SMART questionnaire, and 3 groups were identified: Nonsusceptible nonusers, susceptible nonusers and users. Results show that susceptible nonusers liked the tobacco advertisements significantly more than nonsusceptible nonsmokers, but comparable to users. Liking of the alcohol advertisements increased with alcohol use status. Results suggest that tobacco advertisements targeted at adult smokers may have the effect of recruiting new adolescent smokers.

  Abstract = {Tested the perception of 401 male and female 12–18 yr olds concerning the ages of persons portrayed in TV beer advertisements, and examined the relationships between such age judgments and alcohol use. Each S viewed 4 beer ads randomly selected from national TV, and judged the ages of the youngest person shown using the product. About 40% reported that the youngest person was under 21 in at least 1 of the 4 ads viewed. There was some evidence that junior high school students more often believed that underage persons appeared in the ads than did senior high school students. Also, identifying underage persons in the beer ads was not related to polarity of responses to the ad. These suggest that beer industry guidelines are not achieving their stated goal of ensuring that persons shown in beer ads appear consistently to be 21+ yrs. More tentatively, this failure may be associated with inappropriate drinking decisions by younger adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rig},

Abstract = {This study of 1157 eighth and ninth graders examines how viewers perceived alcohol messages with episodes of The Cosby Show and Family Matters. Viewer perception, in this study, refers to Interest, Comprehension, and Credibility. Relationships between viewer characteristics and viewer perceptions were investigated by means of surveys, conducted in school settings, consisting of both quantitative and qualitative types of questions. A regression analysis suggests that controlling for demographic characteristics, teenagers' involvement with alcohol (i.e., knowing friends or family members who drink) is not significantly associated with the perception of an alcohol message on television. In contrast, when controlling for the same demographic characteristics, teenagers' personal experience with alcohol is meaningfully associated with variations in perception.

  Abstract = {Addresses adolescent drinking (DRK) from a perspective similar to differential association theory. DRK occurs when positive perceptions of DRK outweigh or outnumber negative ones. Images of DRK communicated by rationalized sources (e.g., alcohol advertising) organized specifically to shape perceptions of DRK are discussed. The political economic context of the US in which these sources function is such that positive images of DRK outnumber and outweigh negative ones. This is an important factor contributing to adolescent DRK. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A theoretical model specifying that awareness of advertising, and not mere exposure, is necessary for it to have an effect on beliefs or behaviors, was used. 468 5th and 6th graders (aged 10–13 yrs) from northern California were surveyed with a combination of self-administered questionnaires and structured interviews. Nonrecursive statistical modeling indicated that awareness of TV beer advertising was related to more favorable beliefs about drinking, to greater knowledge of beer brands and slogans, and to increased intentions to drink as an adult, suggesting that alcohol advertising may predispose young people to drinking.

  Abstract = {With extensive Hispanic community involvement, television, radio, and storybook novela were developed to improve Hispanic parent–youth communications and youth attitudes regarding alcohol. Focus groups with the target audiences determined the novelas' concentration on alcohol, their medium and language of choice for Hispanic youth vs parents, and the health messages and cultural values to be portrayed. Reactions to the novelas were obtained via self-report surveys, random street interviews with 375 Hispanic adults (aged 19–76 yrs) and 273 Hispanic youth (aged 9–18 yrs), radio listener call-ins, and community group meetings. Favorable reactions were obtained regarding the novelas' cultural sensitivity and appropriateness and their potential to affect future behavior change. Pre–post self-report survey data from 395 Hispanic middle and high school students indicate that the television novela may have had some positive impact on Ss' attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding alcohol. },

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of youth toward alcohol and alcohol advertising as a precursor to investigating the link between alcohol advertising and consumption in South Africa. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 285 male and 55 female students, aged 10–17 yrs. The results demonstrate that the use and abuse of alcohol is prevalent among these youth, with 83% of the 340 Ss indicating that they had previously drunk alcohol, 90% of whom had done so by age 14. A large proportion (28%) of those that drink had engaged in binge drinking in the previous 2 wks. Television was rated to be the most influential media source, followed by magazines, radio, and newspapers, and was ranked as the 3rd most important source influencing the Ss' views on alcohol, after family and friends. Of interest was the finding that 32% of the Ss believed that alcohol advertising should be illegal. The majority also thought that warning labels should be dis},

  Abstract = {Investigated associations between alcohol consumption at age 18 yrs and alcohol-related mass media communications recalled at ages 13 and 15 yrs in a cohort of 667 New Zealanders born in 1972. Ss' recall of alcohol-related mass media material were categorized as one of the following: commercial alcohol advertising (CAA), alcohol moderation messages, or the portrayal of alcohol in entertainment. At age 15 yrs TV advertising was the predominant material recalled. No relationships were found between CAA and wine and spirits consumption, among either men or women, but young women who had watched more TV drank more wine/spirits. Among women there were 2 unexpected negative relationships between recall of alcohol in the media at age 13 yrs and beer consumption. However, among men there was a consistent positive relationship such that those who had recalled more alcohol advertisements at age 15 yrs drank larger quantities of beer at age 18 yrs.

Abstract = {Explored how federal tax increases on alcoholic beverages were perceived by various categories of drinking students, as well as by gender. An anonymous survey questionnaire was administered to 1,360 9th–12th grade students (660 females, 671 males) to obtain data on Ss' backgrounds, current use of alcohol and other drugs, the social context of their drinking, preferred sources of information on alcohol and other drugs, and perceptions of both alcohol advertisements and alcohol prices. Survey data lend support to previous research (D. Coate and M. Grossman, 1988; P. J. Cook, 1981; and Cook and G. Tauchen, 1982) showing that higher alcohol prices contribute to lower alcohol consumption by youth, as well as to a decrease in related problems such as driving while intoxicated. Results also suggest that a price of around $7.50 for a 6-pack of beer or a 4-pack of wine coolers would discourage purchases by youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  Abstract = {A significant minority of 1990s youth are drinking more alcohol, smoking more tobacco, and/or using more illicit drugs despite a decade of major political and policy initiatives. This paper offers an 'appreciative' analysis whereby young people's licit/illicit drug use is framed as they perceive it as consumption rather than 'abuse.' It is based on a combination of quantitative (confidential self-report questionnaire of 721 13–16-yr-olds) and qualitative (extensive observational fieldwork with 3 street drinking networks and 55 semi-structured interviews with young drinkers aged 12–17 yrs) methods in 1 region of north-west England. It focuses on the accounts of young people as to what, where, and why they drink and the impact of the drink industry's marketing of strong, smooth-tasting, image-laden designer drinks, including alcopops. Results show that the heaviest drinkers were also very likely to use readily available illicit drugs and tobacco as part of a psychoactive repertoire. Ss },

Structural equation modelling was used to assess the fit between data collected as part of a longitudinal study of young people's health and development and a hypothesized model based on theoretical perspectives and previous research. Ss responded to questions about beer consumption, liking for advertising, favorite brand of beer and self-reports of alcohol-related aggressive behavior. Our hypothesized model assumed a positive impact of liking of alcohol advertising and brand allegiance at age 18 on the volume of beer consumed at age 21 and self-reports of alcohol-related aggressive behavior.

The campaign is likely to increase awareness of the youth drug problem, but shortcomings in the campaign's early implementation raise questions about its potential for changing behavior. Shortcomings include: a) the 1st wave of ONDCP's television advertisements are focused on reinforcing problem awareness but do not model skills or provide other information necessary for behavior change; b) the campaign provides insufficient focus on promoting drug treatment and citizen involvement in local prevention activities, including political action; c) the campaign is being implemented without a major new investment in drug-treatment programs or community-based prevention programs; d) The campaign does not substantively address alcohol and tobacco, which pose a clear threat to health and serve as a 'gateway' to illicit drug use; and e) the 1st wave of television advertisem},

Television is the primary source of information for all drugs, except inhalants, for which newspapers/magazines are the main source. Teenagers are less likely to receive information from physicians/nurses and relatives than from other sources. Information based on personal experience is prominent for alcohol, cigarettes, inhalants and hashish/marijuana, and it prevails more among males than among females. Females use teachers as a source of information in all drug categories more than males. Information based on personal experience with alcohol is correlated with that of cigarettes, whereas information based on personal experience with opiates is correlated with that of stimulants, hallucinogens and hashish/marijuana. Mean number of information sources is highest for alcohol and lowest for depressants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Four female and 4 male observers (aged 17–24 yrs) were trained to use a standardized content analysis instrument. All videos were observed by rotating 2-person, male-female teams who were required to reach agreement on each behavior that was scored. Music genre and network differences in behaviors were analyzed with chi-squared tests. A higher percentage (25.7%) of MTV videos than other network videos portrayed tobacco use. The percentage of videos showing alcohol use was similar on all 4 networks. In videos that portrayed tobacco and alcohol use, the lead performer was most often the one smoking or drinking and the use of alcohol was associated with a high degree of sexuality on all the videos.

Over one third had seen a warning label or poster and almost all had seen an advertisement about the risks associated with alcohol consumption. Ss scored very high on 5 items that make up the health consciousness scale introduced here, with 69% endorsing all items. The hypothesized strong relationships between health consciousness and attention to health warnings about drinking were not observed; nor was salience of messages a predictor of recall. High proportions of underage drinkers and young adults at elevated risk for drinking problems are reached by container warning label messages.

In the 1990 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 11,631 Ss provided information on PAC, diet, substance use and other negative health behaviors. Logistic regression analyses examined associations between PAC and other health behaviors in a subset of 2,652 Ss with high PAC and 1,641 Ss with low PAC. Low PAC was associated with cigarette smoking, marijuana use, lower fruit and vegetable consumption, greater TV watching, failure to wear a seat belt and low perception of academic performance. For consumption of fruit, TV watching, and alcohol consumption, significant interactions were found with race/ethnicity or sex, suggesting that sociocultural factors may affect the relationships between PAC and some health behaviors. Low PAC was associated with several other negative health behaviors in teenagers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all righ},

A number of sociocultural factors have been identified, including: (1) adolescents are likely to smoke cigarettes if their parents, siblings, or friends smoke; (2) white students are more likely than Hispanic or African-American students to smoke; (3) advertising impacts adolescent and adult drinking and smoking behavior; (4) adolescent smokers or drinkers are more likely than adults to reduce or quit in response to increased prices of cigarettes or alcohol; (5) workplace smoking bans may reduce smoking prevalence; and (6) stress may influence the extent of tobacco and alcohol use. Smoking is relatively uncommon among nondrinkers, and in adults, research suggests that drinking prompts smoking. Smoking is especially prevalent among heavy drinkers. Most smokers who receive intensive treatment for a histor},

  Abstract = {Four qualitative focus group interviews were conducted with parents (8–22 in each group) of high schoolers to explore their in-depth perceptions of the alcohol consumption patterns of their children. Also discussed by the paid participants were the influences on consumption and appropriate interventions. Results indicate (1) low levels of parental awareness about the extent of teen drinking, (2) low levels of parental control or empowerment over teen drinking, (3) feelings of detachment or isolation from other parents who may share similar concerns, (4) considerable receptivity to receiving skill training in the area of driving while intoxicated and other substance abuse prevention issues, and (5) feelings of resistance to programs that require substantial time commitments of them but favorable disposition toward mass mediated (e.g., cable TV) delivery systems.

  Abstract = {Examined how teenagers perceive a show that is both educational and entertaining. In classrooms, 970 8th- and 9th-grade students viewed and evaluated 1 of 2 videos of a commercial television program featuring an anti-alcohol message. Overall, the sample assessed the programs favorably, finding the messages interesting, credible, and understandable. Firsthand experience with alcohol predicted variations in the perception of an anti-alcohol message, while contact with others who use alcohol did not. Regression analysis showed personal experience with alcohol had a strong relationship to interest, a modest relationship to credibility, but no significant relationship to knowledge. In contrast, social contact with those who use alcohol often (i.e., knowing friends and family members who drink) was not significantly associated with the perceptions of an alcohol message on TV. Such results suggest that those creating and using mass-media health messages effectively must be aware of the actua},

Abstract = {Assesses the responses of 174 young adults (aged 19–22 yrs) and 152 teenagers (aged 16–18 yrs) to 2 basic types of contemporary television spots dealing with responsible drinking and driving. Ss were shown 9 ads presented by beer companies and 9 non-industry public service messages (PSAs), and asked to fill out rating forms measuring perceptions and evaluations of the ads and messages. Ss rated several aspects of the spots including the ads' similarity to commercials vs PSAs. The beer company ads produced dual responses among viewers; many regarded the ads as promoting beer consumption, even permitting drinking by drivers, while others felt the spots offered sensible advice for responsible drinking. The industry spots received less positive ratings and were judged to be less effective than conventional PSAs, which were perceived to be more service-oriented. A limited prosocial impact may have resulted from exposure to the ads. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserve},

  Abstract = {67 students, aged 18–27 yrs, from a large Midwestern university were surveyed, using Social Marketing Theory to improve recruitment and enhance the design of comprehensive alcohol abuse prevention programs. Results indicate that recruitment may be optimized by providing a flexible, convenient, low-cost program that encourages friends' participation, communicates alcohol-related risks, and offers university credit or refund as participation incentives. The design of alcohol abuse prevention programs may be enhanced by emphasizing the positive outcomes of reducing alcohol consumption, improving the quality and quantity of alternatives to the social atmosphere connected with drinking, and soliciting respected opinion leaders (physicians and parents) to communicate alcohol reduction messages. Programs targeted to specific university population subgroups, such as heavy drinkers, may be helpful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Afterwards, as an unrelated task, they completed the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire-Adolescent (AEQ-A) Form (B. A. Christiansen et al; see record [rid]1982-25607-001[/rid]). Exposure to different commercials produced no differences in drinking expectancies. The experiment was repeated on 74 8th graders with similar null results; however, 8th-grade girls more strongly believed that alcohol leads to deteriorated cognitive and behavioral function.

Two focus groups were held with 8 Ss (mean age 15 yrs) who were binge drinkers. The content of the discussions were analyzed using the grounded theory method. Three key findings emerged. First, adolescents drink because they derive benefits from the use or misuse of alcohol, such as increased self-confidence and adult status. Factors which facilitate the use of alcohol include the alleviation of boredom, experimentation, peer pressure, and parental influences. Second, Ss attributed negative characteristics to teetotallers such as being conservative and immature. Binge drinkers were attributed negative characteristics such as lacking self-control and self-respect. Moderate drinkers were attributed with positive characteristics such as being mature and socially adept. Finally, the influential role of alcohol promoting advertising was highlighted. Although S},

A specially designed questionnaire, which included validated scales for the evaluation of depression (Zung Self-rating Depression Scale) and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), was administered to a representative sample of Slovenian adolescents. The final sample consisted of 4,590 high school students of both sexes, aged 14–19 yrs. Data analysis revealed several significant gender differences. Girls more often than boys reported family conflict, personal problems, physical inactivity, attempts to control body weight, use of psychoactive drugs, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Their level of depression was higher and self-esteem lower when compared with their male counterparts. Boys more often than girls indicated that they watched a great deal of television, were the victims of peer violence, and drank alcohol. (PsycINFO Database Record},

  Abstract = {This study utilized a survey to assess television viewing and risk-taking behavior in 717 adolescents (aged 11–22 yrs). Results indicate that, among adolescents, there is a link between exposure to violent television in the form of violent drama, realistic crime shows, and contact sports and participation in various forms of risk taking: problem drinking, drinking and driving, delinquency (vandalizing, trespassing, truancy), reckless driving, and drug use. However, the relationship between exposure to various forms of violent television content and risk-taking behavior varies somewhat. Specifically, exposure to realistic crime shows and exposure to contact sports is positively related to risk taking; whereas, exposure to violent drama is negatively related to risk-taking behavior. Predictions are made and findings discussed in terms of problem behavior theory. Implications for health messages targeting adolescents are discussed.

The program consisted of activity booklets, as well as small group activities and small group projects that Ss completed in the classroom. Ss worked on the booklets at home with their parents during 4 consecutive wks. The booklets covered myths and facts about alcohol, the influence advertising has on youth drinking, peer pressure to drink, and the consequences of, and alternatives to, drinking. Results from a postprogram questionnaire show that the intervention's multiple components insured that Ss across different risk groups were exposed to the prevention messages. Participation rates were very high, even among high-risk groups, showing the general acceptance of the prevention program among communities, parents, and schools.

Austin et al (see record [rid]1991-04230-001[/rid]) in a cross-sectional survey of 154 at-risk preadolescents who were participants in a national youth sports program. The Austin model, which posited that children make selective use of information from home as well as from television to make decisions about alcohol use, received strong support. Children's intentions to drink were predicted by their perceptions of alcohol-related behaviors in the home environment, by their interpretation of television messages, by their desire to be like the television characters who drink, and by their expectancies that drinking brings rewards. An effective strategy for the prevention of alcohol abuse must help children develop skepticism toward televised portrayals of alcohol use and must address the primary role played by parents as information sources and as behavioral models.

  Abstract = {This review of the literature explores the general concept of co-victimization and its impact on African American adolescents, and briefly reviews supporting social learning theory. It is noted that society needs to become more cognizant of the amount of violence to which adolescents are exposed. It is also suggested that the way to reduce this exposure is for society to curtail sources of violence, such as the availability of weapons, alcohol and illicit drugs, and violent movies and television programs, and to reduce parental conflicts and the overall stress and pressures that are a major part of daily life.

The ability to engineer a reduction in tobacco has increased. However, despite an initial decline in cigarette smoking, alcohol and other drug use is on the rise again, among children and adolescents. This may be partly due to a decrease in antidrug abuse media efforts, and an increase in advertising efforts. None of the proven effective drug abuse prevention programs has captured a major share of the market. As new demographic and substance use trends emerge, new or modified strategies are needed for prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Marriage, older age, and low AL consumption were also associated with support; education and voter status were not. Policies and activities that protect youth received the strongest support. Limiting advertisements, increased taxes on AL, and prohibiting wine-cooler sales at convenience stores were least popular.

  Abstract = {Many countries have considered the influence of alcohol advertising on drinking behavior and attitudes as they decide how and to what degree alcohol advertising should be regulated. Results from a study of 35 New Zealand communications experts on alcohol advertising show that both communication/education informants and advertising professionals expressed concern about the macho imagery in alcohol advertising and its appeal to the young. The strong association in advertising between alcohol and sport was a concern of most informants, and there was majority support for the argument that the messages of alcohol companies needed to be balanced by health education. Respondents acknowledged that the absence of content relevant to public health concerns in alcohol advertising made public education more difficult.

Abstract = {40,202 European students (aged 11–16 yrs) from 11 countries anonymously responded to a survey. Sleeping habits and an inability to fall asleep varied significantly between countries, as well as between age groups, but only slightly between the sexes. Finnish schoolchildren experienced the most difficulty in being able to fall asleep. After the Israeli youth, the Finnish schoolchildren had the shortest night's sleep. At least one-fifth of Finnish and Norwegian schoolchildren also reported that they felt tired almost every morning. Frequent use of alcohol and tobacco, lack of physical activity, excessive watching of TV/videos, together with numerous evenings spent outside the home were all connected with going to bed late as well as with frequent difficulty in not being able to fall asleep. Inability to fall asleep was most strongly related to number of psychosomatic symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A review of the literature suggested that African American drink less but suffer from more negative consequences of drinking. Although African Americans are only 14% of the population, they are reported to consume 30% of malt liquor beers. Most surveys which seek to measure alcohol consumption patterns for African American men refer to questions related to mainstream alcohol types. For African American men, the literature has not addressed these phenomena nor adequately provided a culturally-specific theoretical framework by which to start addressing these issues.

The present author sought to determine whether empirical evidence might be found to support the hypothesis that alcohol-inexperienced adolescents learn alcohol expectancies from parents, peers, and media sources. Participants were 135 rural eighth grade students, a best friend, and a parent. The adolescents were largely inexperienced with alcohol use (70.3% reported less than two drinks yearly) and parent mean use was also in the non-clinical range (average frequency was 10.2 drinking occasions yearly, with an average of 1.3 drinks per occasion). Adolescent and peer expectancies were measured with the AEO-A, parent expectancies were measured with the AEQ. Adolescents reported their perception of parent, peer, and media expectancies with revised version},

Moreover, adolescent experiences occur in the context of developing an identity in relation to others, suggesting that varied relational issues are central to the understanding of adolescent depression.
