AB OBJECTIVES: To examine stress and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among third-year doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) students.; METHODS: Stress and HRQOL were determined using Perceived Stress and SF-12 HRQOL survey instruments. A questionnaire was administered to determine factors students believed produced and eliminated stress.; RESULTS: Eighty percent of third-year students participated (n=109) in this pilot study. Mental HRQOL scores were significantly below US mean score for individuals aged 20-34 years (p<0.0001). As stress increased, mental HRQOL decreased and a significant negative correlation was found between the 2 measures (p<0.001). Family and relationships, examinations and scheduling, outside-of-class assignments, and finances were the most common stress triggers reported by students, while exercising, spending time with friends/family, sleeping, watching TV, and drinking alcohol were the most commonly reported stress-alleviating activities.; CONCLUSION: Third-year PharmD students reported relatively high levels of stress and low mental HRQOL. Students employed mostly positive, but some negative, lifestyle choices to alleviate stress. Further investigation into the effectiveness of students' coping strategies is needed.

AB AIMS: To examine the nature and extent of alcohol industry sponsorship of sportspeople, and its association with drinking.; METHODS: A purposive sample of participants (n = 1279) from various sporting codes were asked whether they personally, their team, or club received free and/or discounted alcohol or funding from an alcohol industry body (e.g. pub, brewery, wholesaler); how much they received; and whether they felt they should drink their sponsor's product and/or at the sponsor's premises. Drinking behaviour was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire.; FINDINGS: Alcohol industry sponsorship was reported by 47.8% of the sample. Of those sponsored, 47% reported receiving free and/or discounted alcohol products. In multivariate models, those receiving sponsorship at the individual, team and club level had AUDIT scores that were, on average, 2.4 points higher [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-4.09] than those who received no sponsorship. Receiving free and/or discounted alcohol (beta(adj) = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.01-1.88) and feeling that they should go to the sponsor's pub/club to drink (beta(adj) = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.85-2.98) were also associated with higher AUDIT scores. Provision of free or discounted alcoholic beverages was associated more strongly with AUDIT scores (beta(adj) = 1.56; 95% CI: 0.62-2.51) than other forms of sponsorship from the alcohol industry (e.g. provision of uniforms).; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol industry sponsorship of sportspeople, and in particular the provision of free or discounted alcoholic beverages, is associated with hazardous drinking after adjustment for a range of potential confounders. Sports administration bodies should consider the health and ethical risks of accepting alcohol industry sponsorship.

AB OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the HIV risk behaviours of male migrant contracted and non-contracted labourers in India and to understand the role of contract labour systems for use in HIV prevention efforts.; METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys (N = 11 219) were conducted with male migrant workers, aged 18-49 years from 21 districts in four high HIV prevalence states of India. Analyses involved data from the subsample of contracted labour (n = 3880; 35% of total sample) to assess the prevalence of HIV risk behaviours and sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms and further comparisons with non-contracted labourers.; RESULTS: Contracted male labourers are largely young; 70% were between the ages of 18 and 29 years. Over half (55%) were married, and a third (34%) resided away from their wives because of migrant work. More than one in six contract labourers (17%) reported having sex with a sex worker, and two-fifths of these reported an inconsistent use of condoms. One in 10 reported sex with both sex workers and non-spousal unpaid female partners in the past year in the places they had migrated to, and 31% reported sex with either a sex worker or non-spousal unpaid female partner in their places of origin over the past 2 years. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, the contracted labourers were significantly more likely to report alcohol use and HIV risk behaviours than non-contracted labourers.; CONCLUSION: The existence of a wide network of labour contractors and a structured infrastructure of the contract system provides opportunities for effective and sustained worksite HIV prevention programmes among contracted male migrant workers in India.

AB This study aimed to investigate the bioequivalence of a test formulation of tibolone with the marketed reference formulation in 24 young healthy female volunteers. Tibolone is a synthetic steroid hormone for menopausal women. Volunteers were treated with the 2 formulations of tibolone (total dose of active ingredient 2.5 mg) according to a 2 x 2 crossover design with a 1-week washout period. Plasma concentrations of 3alpha- and 3beta-hydroxytibolone, which are major metabolites of tibolone, were assayed in timed samples over a 24-hour period with a validated gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method that had a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL. The reference and test formulations gave a mean 3alpha-hydroxytibolone C(max) of 5.0 and 5.2 ng/mL, respectively, and a mean 3beta-hydroxytibolone C(max) of 16.4 and 16.5 ng/mL, respectively. The mean AUC(t) of 3alpha-hydroxytibolone was 24.7 and 24.3 ng h/mL, whereas the mean AUC(t) of 3beta-hydroxytibolone was 57.6 and 54.8 ng h/mL for the test and reference formulations, respectively. The authors did not find significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the 2 formulations, but metabolite formation was different from reports in postmenopausal women. The authors therefore measured the effects of estradiol on the expression of the tibolone-metabolizing enzymes, from the aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C) family, using HepG2 cell (human hepatoma cells) and MCF-7 cell (human breast cancer cells). Estradiol increased mRNA levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3 and protein levels of total AKR1C in HepG2 cells. Estradiol selectively enhanced levels of AKR1C2 mRNA in MCF-7 cells. Thus, changes in the major metabolites of tibolone might result from changes in AKR1C family expression by patient estrogen status.

CCSCP was a culturally tailored, randomized, smoking cessation trial testing the efficacy of an intensive (physician advice, in-person counseling with nicotine replacement therapy, 5 telephone calls) compared to a minimal (physician advice and self-help manual) intervention. The study applied a community-sensitive research method involving community members in all phases of the research process in San Francisco Bay Area during 2001-2007. CCSCP recruited 464 smokers from health care facilities (79%) located in Chinese neighborhoods and through Chinese language media (21%). Baseline assessments and interventions were conducted in-person using translated and tested questionnaire and intervention materials. The majority of the participants were men (91%) with a mean age of 58.3 years, foreign born (98%), with less than high school education (58%), spoke no English (42%) and in non-skilled or semi-skilled occupations (60%) with <$20,000 household income (51%). Participants smoked regularly on an average 38.6 +/- 17 years, smoked 9.1 +/- 8 cigarettes per day and 85% smoked daily. Cultural tailoring of recruitment methods and intervention design led to successful enrollment and retention of participants, overcoming barriers faced by the participants. Community sensitive collaborative process facilitated implementation of study protocol in community health care settings.

AB OBJECTIVE: This preliminary study investigated prevalence rates of multiple health-related behaviors (ie, tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; sexual risk-taking; nutrition/physical activity; overweight and dietary behaviors; sun safety) among 42 adolescents on active treatment for cancer, as compared with healthy adolescent norms.; METHODS: Health-related behaviors were assessed using the 2005 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, for which healthy adolescent norms were publicly available.; RESULTS: Adolescents with cancer reported significantly lower current and lifetime rates of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; fruit/vegetable consumption; physical activity; and dietary behavior, in addition to lower rates of lifetime sexual intercourse, early-onset sexual intercourse, and alcohol/drug use before last sexual intercourse, compared with healthy peers. Among those who have previously engaged in sexual intercourse, there appeared to be a trend toward increased partners, current sexual activity, and lack of protection at last episode of sexual intercourse. Adolescents with cancer also reported significantly higher rates of television watching compared with healthy peers.; CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents on active treatment for cancer are engaging in multiple health-risk behaviors, including sedentary behavior, poor nutrition, lack of sun safety, and sexual risk-taking (eg, multiple partners, lack of protection at last sexual intercourse). Health promotion interventions are needed during active treatment to facilitate the acquisition of good health practices as adolescents transition into survivorship.

AB Sexual behavior and substance use represent major threats to the health and well-being of South African adolescents, especially in light of the high prevalence of HIV infection in this population. However, there is currently a lack of evidence-based school programs designed to address health risk behaviors. The current study details the evaluation of HealthWise South Africa, a leisure, life skills, and sexuality education intervention for eighth and ninth grade students. We hypothesized that, compared to controls, HealthWise participants would have delayed sexual initiation, reduced rates of current sexual activity, increased use of and perceived access to condoms, and lower rates of lifetime and past use of multiple substances. Longitudinal data were analyzed using logistic regression of multiply imputed data. Results indicate that HealthWise was effective in increasing the perception of condom availability for both genders (OR = 1.6). As compared to HealthWise participants, control participants also had steeper increases in recent and heavy use of alcohol (OR = 1.4 [95% C.I. = 1.1-1.8], 1.6 [1.2-2.2], respectively) and recent and heavy cigarette use (OR = 1.4 [1.1-1.7], 1.4 [1.1-1.8], respectively). There were also several significant gender by treatment interactions, which are discussed. These results suggest that HealthWise is a promising approach to reducing multiple health risk behaviors among the population of school-going South African adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: Problems related to alcohol consumption are frequent, especially among the youth population. We analyzed advertisement as one of several modifiable factors with impact over alcohol consumption.; METHOD: The authors carried out a literature review within Medline, SciELO, PsychoInfo and Google Scholar databases between 1990 and 2008, retrieving studies with different approaches of the alcohol advertisement impact on consumption. Besides, a ' snowball' technique was applied to identify the most proficuous authors on the matter. Over a hundred papers were initially selected.; RESULTS: The overall set of papers indicate that factors such as exposition to the advertising and attractiveness of the alcoholic beverage advertising are related with greater expectation of future consumption and with a higher and precocious consumption of alcohol, specially among adolescents and young adults. Despite methodological difficulties, recent econometrical studies indicate that reduction and/or banishment of advertising would decrease alcohol consumption. We also consider issues about the neurophysiology of decision making process and the freedom of choice in the context of exposition to advertisements.; CONCLUSIONS: The current knowledge on the matter strongly suggests that a reduction of the exposition to alcohol advertisements impacts on its consumption, mainly among young populations.

AB OBJECTIVE: This article describes the characteristics of violence-related injury (VRI) cases presenting at emergency departments (EDs) in Brazil and compares circumstances for assault-related and self-inflicted cases.; METHODS: The study is cross-sectional. The data describe cases seen in September 2006 in 62 EDs, representing all 26 states and the Federal District. A total of 4 835 case records were analyzed. Basic statistical tabulations were complemented by logistic regression analysis to assess potential associations between type of violence (assault or self-harm) and multiple factors.; RESULTS: Males comprised 72.8% of cases while those aged 20 to 29 comprised 35.4%. Alcohol use was reported or suspected in 42.7% of cases, more commonly among males. Assault victims comprised 91.4% of cases versus self-inflicted injuries, which accounted for 8.6%. Three-fourths of the assault victims were male, while over half of the self-inflicted injury victims were female. The leading mechanism for assaults was physical force/blunt objects (46.2%), whereas poisoning was the predominant mechanism for self-inflicted injuries (71.4%). Younger females were significantly more likely to have been victims of self-inflicted injuries than younger males, while younger males were more likely to have been victims of assault; this finding is more pronounced in cases where alcohol use was reported. Self-inflicted injuries were significantly more likely to occur in residences, while assaults were more likely to occur away from home.; CONCLUSION: These results can improve understanding of the scope and characteristics of VRIs in Brazil (and thus contribute to national injury prevention efforts), and help identify areas for future research.

AB AIMS: Concerns have been raised about patients' failure to persist in alcohol treatment. We examined prescriptions for oral naltrexone in a large, nationally distributed treatment population to identify characteristics and health-care utilization patterns associated with persistence.; DESIGN: Data from the 2000-2004 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database were used to identify patients with alcohol-related claims who were prescribed naltrexone.; MEASUREMENTS: Analysis identified patient characteristics that predicted persistence with naltrexone (defined as having filled prescriptions for >or=80% of the 6-month treatment period) and its association to health-care utilization.; FINDINGS: Of 1138 patients, 162 (14.2%) were persistent in obtaining naltrexone. Non-persistent patients were significantly younger, more likely to be hourly employees and to live in an area with a lower median income, and less likely to be newly diagnosed with an alcohol-related disorder. Non-persistence in obtaining naltrexone was associated with significantly more intensive treatments, including inpatient detoxification, emergency room visits and hospitalizations.; CONCLUSIONS: Over a 6-month period, 85.8% of patients who filled an initial prescription for naltrexone did not persist in obtaining the medication. Non-persistence was associated with significantly greater use of costly health-care services. Because the study was correlational, it is not possible to conclude that persistence reduced health-care costs, as patients with a better prognosis may have been more persistent. Research is needed to determine whether interventions that enhance persistence with naltrexone therapy improve treatment outcomes and reduce health-care costs.

AB AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cues that signal the alcoholic strength of a beverage on drinking rate in young social drinkers.; METHODS: In Experiment 1, two groups of young social drinkers (n=20 per group) consumed a lager-based drink containing either 3% or 7% alcohol-by-volume. The pattern of drinking behaviour was observed, and drinking time was recorded. Self-reported mood was measured across the session, and participants also provided ratings of the drinks' sensory and hedonic properties. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1, but used a within-subjects design (n=12).; RESULTS: In both experiments, participants took significantly longer to consume the 7% drink compared with the 3% drink, and the total inter-sip interval was longer for the 7% drink. These effects were most closely related to the participants' changing estimates of alcohol strength across the test session, alongside concomitant changes in various aspects of self-reported mood. Sensory and hedonic evaluations of the drinks did not affect drinking behaviour in either experiment.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the consumption rate of an alcoholic beverage can be modulated by its alcohol content, and that the perceived pharmacological effect of the alcohol serves as an effective signal to alter drinking behaviour.

AB Precursor behaviors are innocuous behaviors that reliably precede the occurrence of problem behavior. Intervention efforts applied to precursors might prevent the occurrence of severe problem behavior. We examined the relationship between precursor behavior and problem behavior in three individuals with developmental disabilities. First, a descriptive (correlational) assessment focusing on transitional probabilities, which established that problem behavior typically followed precursor behavior, was conducted. Next, a functional (experimental) analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between precursor and problem behavior. Results suggested that these two behaviors served the same function. Finally, in the intervention phase, participants were taught a response that was functionally equivalent to the precursor behavior. Results demonstrated a decrease in the frequency of problem behavior. Collectively, these results suggest that prevention efforts might profitably be focused on precursor behavior. Further implications for the use of functional analysis and functional communication training in prevention are discussed.

AB This study tested whether pro-alcohol peer influences and prosocial involvement account for increases in drinking during the transition into emerging adulthood and whether these mechanisms differ depending on college attendance and/or moving away from home. The authors used structural equation modeling of prospective data from 825 young men and women. For 4 groups defined by college and residential status, more drinking in the spring of 12th grade predicted more pro-alcohol peer influences the following fall, and more pro-alcohol peer influences in the fall predicted increases in drinking the following spring. Going to college while living at home was a protective factor against increases in drinking and selection of pro-alcohol peer involvements. Prosocial involvement (measured by involvement in religious activities and volunteer work) was not significantly related to post-high school drinking except among college students living away from home. Prevention efforts should focus on (a) reducing opportunities for heavy drinking for college and noncollege emerging adults as they leave home and (b) increasing prosocial involvement among college students not living at home.

AB OBJECTIVE: Suicide rates are often high in rural areas. Despite the strong association between deliberate self-harm (DSH) and suicide, few have studied rural residence and DSH. Self-poisonings dominate DSH hospital presentations. We investigate a previously reported association between rural residence and medical severity (defined as a subsequent medical/surgical inpatient stay) among emergency department presentations for medicinal self-poisoning (SP) to determine whether differences in agents taken, mental health service use or hospital-level resources explain the relationship.; METHOD: A cohort of n=16,294 12-64-year olds presenting with SP to hospital emergency departments in Ontario, Canada, in 2001/2002 was linked to their service records over time.; RESULTS: The rural-medical severity association was best explained by differences in hospital resources; presenting to hospitals providing inpatient psychiatric services appeared to reduce medical/surgical inpatient stays in favor of psychiatric ones. Among those with a recent psychiatric admission, more intensive ambulatory psychiatric contact may be protective of a psychiatric inpatient stay subsequent to the SP presentation. Compared to nonrural residents, deliberate intent was identified less often in rural residents, particularly males.; CONCLUSIONS: The rural-medical severity association was best explained by disparities in the delivery systems serving rural and nonrural residents, important to rural suicide prevention efforts.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the framing of alcohol consumption in the American adolescent drama series The OC.; METHOD: All 51 episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 of The OC were coded for visual and verbal references to beverage use on the level of the scene (n = 1,895) and on the level of the drinking act (n = 1,033). Subsequently, all episodes were analyzed qualitatively through an inductive frame analysis.; RESULTS: Although the public's perception of The OC is that alcohol was overrepresented in this series, the quantitative results show the opposite. The focus was on active consumption and solitary drinking of alcohol, but in absolute terms there were more nonalcoholic drinking acts. The OC represents a trend break, compared with earlier analyses of alcohol consumption in television fiction: More than half of all alcoholic drinking acts involved women, and almost one third involved adolescents. The qualitative frame analysis revealed two commonly used frames (alcohol consumption as an "obligatory outlet" and alcohol consumption as "escapism") and two less frequently applied frames ("celebrate without the sauce" and alcohol addiction as "sickness").; CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the concept of framing might contribute to this field of study by analyzing the underlying cultural frames that suggest how the receiver may interpret the consumption of alcohol in fictional television programs.

AB Prenatal drug use is commonly associated with adverse birth outcomes, yet no studies have controlled for a comprehensive set of associated social, psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors. We examined the degree to which adverse birth outcomes associated with drug use are due to the drugs versus surrounding factors. Data are from a clinical sample of low-income women who delivered at Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1995 and 1996 (n = 808). Use of marijuana, cocaine, and opiates was determined by self-report, medical record, and urine toxicology screens at delivery. Information on various social, psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors was gathered from a postpartum interview or the medical record. Multivariable regression models of birth outcomes (continuous birth weight and low birth weight ([LBW] < 2,500 g)) were used to assess the effect of drug use independent of associated factors. In unadjusted results, all types of drug use were related to birth weight decrements and increased odds of LBW. However, only the effect of cocaine on continuous birth weight remained significant after adjusting for all associated factors (-142 g, p = 0.05). No drug was significantly related to LBW in fully adjusted models. About 70% of the unadjusted effect of cocaine use on continuous birth weight was explained by surrounding psychosocial and behavioral factors, particularly smoking and stress. Most of the unadjusted effects of opiate use were explained by smoking and lack of early prenatal care. Thus, prevention efforts that aim to improve newborn health must also address the surrounding context in which drug use frequently occurs.

AB BACKGROUND: Substance use is quite common among adolescents. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of parents on their habits.; METHODS: The study sample was made up of all 13 to 15 year old schoolchildren from the island of Majorca and their parents. Information was collected, with validated instruments, on parents and adolescents alcohol intake, smoking, socioeconomic status, sports and television watching, as well as adolescents academic performance.; RESULTS: The study included 4,019 schoolchildren and 7,359 parents. Parents belonging to a low socioeconomic level was the principal variable related to parental influence on smoking children (OR=3.86, 95% CI: 2.30-6.48, p=0.000), drinking (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.40-2.54; p=0.000), failing courses (OR=6.37, 95% CI: 4.23-9.61; p=0.000), watching TV 2 hours/day (OR=1.97; 95%IC:1.69-2.29; p=0.000), and not practicing sports (OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.80; p=0.001). Additionally, the mothers drinking had an influence on the children's smoking (OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.24-1.51; p=0.002), and the parents smoking had an influence on the children's (boys, not girls) failing courses (OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.33-2.68; p=0.000). The corresponding habits in parents increased the probability that adolescents drank (OR=1.91, 95% CI: 1.43-2.51; p=0.000), watched TV 2 hours/day (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.68-2.29; p=0.000), and practiced sports (OR=6.67, 95% CI: 2.57-14.96; p=0.000).; CONCLUSIONS: A low socioeconomic level is associated with a greater risk of smoking, drinking, failing courses and not practicing sports in the adolescents. Additionally, the mothers drinking is associated with a greater risk of her children smoking and drinking, and both parents drinking is associated with a greater risk of their children doing so. The practice of sports and the time spent watching television by the parents have an influence on the corresponding habits in their children, but have no influence on the adolescents smoking or drinking.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the likelihood of Latino day laborers being solicited for sex by other men.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: 450 Latino day laborers were recruited in Los Angeles, California, from July to September 2005. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which day laborers were more likely to be solicited and subsequently to have sex.; RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent reported being solicited for sex by another man while seeking work. Those solicited were more likely to live longer in the US, be more educated and screen positive for drug dependence. Of those solicited, 9.4% had sex with their solicitors. Those screening positive for drug dependence were more likely to have sex. Most of the day laborers who had anal sex with their solicitors did not always use condoms.; CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention efforts should target drug dependent day laborers, who may place themselves at risk for HIV through sex with male solicitors.

AB BACKGROUND: Europe is the heaviest-drinking region in the world, more than 2.5 times the rest of the world's average. THE COMMISSION'S CONCLUSION: The cornerstone for the European Commission's action to decrease the alcohol-related harm of this consumption and the main emphasis for its work is the Alcohol and Health Forum, with its Task Forces on Marketing Communication and Youth-Specific Aspects of Alcohol. The Forum, which was launched in June 2007, aims to provide a common platform for all interested stakeholders. Forum members are invited to make commitments to reduce alcohol-related harm, in the form of a monitored and evaluated action plan. By 29 February 2008, 79 commitments have been provided by the members of the Forum.; APPRAISAL OF THE INITIATIVE: Taking into account the limited information available, the proposed commitments indicate few evidence-based approaches. A large majority of the summaries do not, or only slightly, address the relevance of their commitment and give no evidence of why their proposed action is important in reducing alcohol-related harm. Even fewer commitments mention indicators of effectiveness of the proposed actions or propose to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed actions.; CONCLUSION: While most economic operators in the Forum have resources to undertake actions which could be highly effective, they commit principally to educational programmes which have been found to be mainly ineffective. This, and the neglect of existing legislation, do not give reason for optimism on the impact of the proposed commitments.

AB AIM: This study examines the relationship between physical, socio-economic and social environments and alcohol consumption and drunkenness among a general population sample of drinkers aged 12-17 years. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASURES: The study was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. The design comprised two components: (i) environmental measures including alcohol outlet density, locality-based measure of willingness to sell alcohol (derived from purchase surveys of outlets) and a locality-based neighbourhood deprivation measure calculated routinely in New Zealand (known as NZDEP); and (ii) the second component was a random telephone survey to collect individual-level information from respondents aged 12-17 years including ethnicity, frequency of alcohol supplied socially (by parents, friends and others), young person's income; frequency of exposure to alcohol advertising; recall of brands of alcohol and self-reported purchase from alcohol outlets. A multi-level model was fitted to predict typical-occasion quantity, frequency of drinking and drunkenness in drinkers aged 12-17 years.; FINDINGS: Typical-occasion quantity was predicted by: frequency of social supply (by parents, friends and others); ethnicity and outlet density; and self-reported purchasing approached significance. NZDEP was correlated highly with outlet density so could not be analysed in the same model. In a separate model, NZDEP was associated with quantity consumed on a typical drinking occasion. Annual frequency was predicted by: frequency of social supply of alcohol, self-reported purchasing from alcohol outlets and ethnicity. Feeling drunk was predicted by frequency of social supply of alcohol, self-reported purchasing from alcohol outlets and ethnicity; outlet density approached significance. Age and gender also had effects in the models, but retailers' willingness to sell to underage patrons had no effects on consumption, nor did the advertising measures. The young person's income was influential on typical-occasion quantity once deprivation was taken into account.; CONCLUSION: Alcohol outlet density was associated with quantities consumed among teenage drinkers in this study, as was neighbourhood deprivation. Supply by family, friends and others also predicted quantities consumed among underage drinkers and both social supply and self-reported purchase were associated with frequency of drinking and drunkenness. The ethnic status of young people also had an effect on consumption.

AB Genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to cannabis abuse/dependence (CAD). We sought to determine the magnitude of the contribution from measured environmental variables to offspring cannabis dependence in a design that controls for familial vulnerability. Data come from a study of 725 twin members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, 720 of their biological offspring (age 18-32 years) and 427 mothers. Data were obtained on offspring perception of family and peer support and substance use behaviors and offspring CAD. After adjusting for familial risk, and environmental covariates, CAD was significantly more likely among male offspring (OR=2.73; 95% CI: 1.69-4.41). Offspring CAD was associated with reporting: siblings used illicit drugs (OR=3.40; 95% CI: 1.81-6.38), a few friends used drugs (OR=2.72; 95% CI: 1.04-7.09), a quarter or more friends used drugs (OR=8.30; 95% CI: 3.09-22.33) and one-half or more 12th grade peers used drugs (OR=3.17; 95% CI: 1.42-7.08). Perceived sibling, friend and school peer substance use are strongly associated with CAD in young adults even after accounting for latent familial risk and for multiple measured intra-family and extra-family environmental influences.

AB This paper presents the methodology and results of the implementation of a Surveillance System for Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors in Adolescents. A random sample of 8th-grade students (n = 1,684) enrolled in municipal schools in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was studied. Students were asked to complete a confidential questionnaire on food consumption, physical activity, sedentary leisure-time activities, and tobacco consumption. Prevalence estimates of risk factors were calculated for the entire sample and by gender. Non-response rates ranged from 1.1 to 8.9%. The findings included low consumption of fruits (45.8%) and vegetables (20.0% and 16.5% for salads and cooked vegetables, respectively), regular consumption of soft drinks (36.7%) and candies (46.7%), extensive time on TV, computer, and videogames (71.7% spend at least 4h/day at these activities), low frequency of regular physical activity (40%), and 6.4% prevalence of smoking. Girls showed less physical activity and more smoking. The system appeared to be feasible and indicated high prevalence of risk factors for non-communicable diseases.

AB Based on voice-history data, a chi2 test was used to investigate the difference between students of acting (n = 45) and other students (n = 45). A t-test was used to calculate the differences in acoustic parameters between the two groups. It was expected that students of acting spent significantly more time practicing voice exercises, took more acting instructions, and generally spoke more in larger rooms and did warm up exercises (p < .001). However, it was not expected that they smoked more than non-professionals (p = .003), and that they drank alcoholic drinks as much as other students. Male students of acting had significantly lower f(0) SD means (p = .015), which means that they had a more stable pitch throughout phonation. Students of acting also showed a significantly higher Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) than other students (p = .001 for males; p = .01 for females). The data showed the importance of the appropriate use of voice, which reflected relatively good voice quality despite the bad living habits of the future professional voice users.

AB BACKGROUND: Changes in employment status may be associated with changes in health-related lifestyle, but population level research of such associations is very limited. This study aimed to determine associations between lifestyle and five employment trajectories, i.e. 'stable', 'unstable', 'upward' 'downward' and 'chronic unemployment'.; METHODS: A cohort of 10,100 employees was followed up for 5 years. Associations of the employment trajectories with changes in smoking, alcohol drinking, body weight, physical activity and sleep duration were assessed with analysis of variance for repeated measures and pairwise post hoc comparisons.; RESULTS: Smoking was the only lifestyle component that was not associated with employment trajectory. In both genders, sleep duration decreased during chronic unemployment and among those on a downward employment trajectory. In men, alcohol consumption also increased in these two groups and body weight increased in the latter group. In women, physical activity decreased among those on a downward trajectory. In contrast, an upward labour market trajectory was associated with healthy or no changes in lifestyle both in men and women.; CONCLUSION: Changes in lifestyle may contribute to development of the health gradients between the employed and unemployed, whereas unstable employment versus permanent employment does not incur risk of unhealthy lifestyle changes. In order to prevent widening of employment-related health inequalities, passages into employment should be facilitated and opportunities for health promotion should be improved among those trapped in or moving towards the labour market periphery.

AB BACKGROUND: Betel quid chewing (BQC) in Vietnam is still prevalent, however, no detailed information about its association with oral cancer and pre-cancer are available in the English literature. Respective online searches (PubMed, Medline) were negative.; METHODS: Relevant publications in Vietnamese were collected by the authors and translated. Visits to cancer centres and institutes of odontology (Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi) were made and seminars with respective scientists were held. Field excursions to local markets and interviews with betel quid vendors and individual BQ chewers gave further insights.; RESULTS: Generally, BQC is on the decline in Vietnam. 6.7% of the female population still seems to indulge in this habit. In an earlier study, a prevalence of 0.06% of oral cancer was reported. In a study of 1084 cases of oral cancer, the male:female ratio was 1.05:1 (1997). The age group between 60 and 75 years is most often affected by oral cancer. In BQ chewing women, the buccal mucosa (27.9%), tongue (23.1%) and lips (22.4%) are most often affected. Verrucous carcinoma is seen in the age group 70-79 years with women most often being affected (male:female ratio 1:3.4). The most important risk factor for oral cancer in women is BQC compared with men where smoking, alcohol drinking or combined smoking and drinking habits are the most common risk factors. Oral leukoplakia in BQ chewers is observed in 3.8%, oral submucous fibrosis in 13%.; CONCLUSIONS: BQC in Vietnam is on the decline. Association between BQC and oral cancer in elderly women is still of importance. Eventually, the BQC habit will vanish and only play a role in socio-ritual contexts.

AB This article uses qualitative interviews with 53 problematic drug users who had dropped out of treatment in England, UK to explore how they describe the stigmatisation of drug users and drug services. It discusses the construction of the category of the junkie through its association with un-controlled heroin use and criminality. It shows how some drug users carefully manage information about their discreditable identities by excluding themselves from this category, while acknowledging its validity for other drug users. The junkie identity was generally seen as shameful and therefore to be avoided, although it holds attractions for some drug users. For many of the interviewees, entry to treatment risked exposing their own activities as shaming, as they saw treatment as being a place that was populated by junkies and where it becomes more difficult to manage discreditable information. The treatment regime, e.g. the routine of supervised consumption of methadone, was itself seen by some as stigmatising and was also seen as hindering progress to the desired 'normal' life of conventional employment. Participation in the community of users of both drugs and drug services was perceived as potentially damaging to the prospects of recovery. This emphasises the importance of social capital, including links to people and opportunities outside the drug market. It also highlights the danger that using the criminal justice system to concentrate prolific offenders in treatment may have the perverse effects of excluding other people who have drug problems and of prolonging the performance of the junkie identity within treatment services. It is concluded that treatment agencies should address these issues, including through the provision of more drug services in mainstream settings, in order to ensure that drug services are not seen to be suitable only for one particularly stigmatised category of drug user.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent debates on 'binge drinking' in the UK have represented the activities of young drinkers in urban areas as a particular source of concern, as constituting a threat to law and order, a drain on public health and welfare services and as a source of risk to their own future health and well being. The discourse of moral panic around young people's 'binge drinking' has pervaded popular media, public policy and academic research, often differentiating the excesses of 'binge drinking' from 'normal' patterns of alcohol consumption, although in practice definitions of 'binge drinking' vary considerably. However, recent research in this area has drawn on the notion of 'calculated hedonism' to refer to a way of 'managing' alcohol consumption that might be viewed as excessive.; METHODS: The paper presents a critical analysis of contemporary discourses around 'binge drinking' in the British context, highlighting contradictory messages about responsibility and self control in relation to the recent liberalisation of licensing laws and the extensive marketing of alcohol to young people. The paper analyses marketing communications which present drinking as a crucial element in 'having fun', and as an important aspect of young people's social lives. The empirical study involves analysis of focus group discussions and individual interviews with young people aged 18-25 in three areas of Britain: a major city in the West Midlands, a seaside town in the South-West of England and a small market town also in the South-West.; RESULTS: The initial findings present the varied forms and meanings that socialising and drinking took in these young people's social lives. In particular the results illustrate the ways in which drinking is constituted and managed as a potential source of pleasure.; CONCLUSION: The paper concludes that the term 'calculated hedonism' better describes the behaviour of the young people in this study and in particular the way they manage their pleasure around alcohol, than the emotive term 'binge drinking'.

AB PURPOSE: To identify risk and protective factors during early and later adolescence that predict future regular smoking and multiple problem behavior among at-risk youth, defined as those who tried smoking by grade 7.; METHODS: At grades 7, 10, and 12, data were collected from 2,000 early smokers drawn from California and Oregon. Multivariate regression analyses tested predictors of the two grade 12 outcomes in separate models using data from grades 7 and 10. Gender interactions and buffering of risk factors by protective factors were assessed.; RESULTS: For at-risk youth, consistent protective factors against future smoking and problem behavior included living in an intact nuclear family (all four models) plus getting good grades and parental disapproval of smoking/drug use (three of four models). Consistent risk factors included exposure to substance-using peers (four models) and problems in school (three of four models). Adult substance use was a predictor during early, but not later, adolescence; pro-smoking/drug use beliefs were significant predictors during later adolescence. There were few differences across gender and no significant buffers against risk.; CONCLUSIONS: At-risk youth would likely benefit from peer resistance training, parental involvement in prevention efforts, and efforts to improve educational performance during both middle school and high school. Changing pro-drug beliefs may be more effective among older adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare national estimates of drug use and exposure to violence between rural and urban teens.; METHODS: Twenty-eight dependent variables from the 2003 Youth Risk Behavior Survey were used to compare violent activities, victimization, suicidal behavior, tobacco use, alcohol use, and illegal drug use across rural, urban, and suburban teens across the country.; RESULTS: Overall, rural teens were equally or more likely than both suburban and urban teens to report experiencing many measures of violent behavior, victimization, suicide behaviors, and drug use. Among all teens, nonwhites reported equal or higher rates of violent behavior and victimization than whites, but these associations disappeared within the rural-only population.; CONCLUSIONS: Rural areas do not appear to provide a strongly protective effect against risk behaviors in teens and may be a risk factor in itself. Community prevention efforts should focus on reaching rural areas and segmenting program content based on need. Where white teens might benefit from an emphasis on preventing tobacco and alcohol use, nonwhite teens would benefit from an emphasis on preventing violence and victimization.

AB The Genitourinary (GU) Medicine Service was transferred from the Home Office to the NHS from April 2006 at this female prison to give prisoners access to the same quality of health care as the general public. Medline search showed no published data on the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female prisoners in the UK. The main aim was to develop a one stop sexual health shop and to determine the prevalence and risk factors for STIs, to determine the uptake rate for HIV testing, hepatitis B vaccination and cervical cytology along with requests for usage of contraceptive services. Challenges were met when introducing change to bring the services in line with the local GU medicine clinic. Review of the service at one year along with retrospective case note review from May 2006 to August 2007 was done. Of the 545 new patients seen, history of substance abuse, IVDU, sexual abuse, sex worker and past history of hepatitis C virus and chlamydia were 86%, 41%,12%, 6%, 17% and 24% respectively.The uptake rate for both STI screen and blood-borne viruses (BBVs) testing was high at 87% and 69.3% respectively. STI was diagnosed in 19.6%. Prevalence rates were: Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) 8.2%, chlamydia 5.3%, gonorrhoea 0.2%, genital warts 5.3%, HIV 0.8%, hepatitis C virus 12% and hepatitis B virus 11%. The uptake rate for 1(st) dose hepatitis B vaccination and cervical cytology were 70% and 92% respectively, 36 accessed contraceptive services. Provision of one stop shop in a female prison is feasible and practical. STIs, particularly TV, and BBVs prevalence is high among the female inmates. Prevention methods targeting this population needs to be intensified.

AB Adolescents' alcohol-related attitudes and behaviors may be affected by marketing efforts of the alcohol industry, retailers, and the catering industry. Most research has focused on the effects of commercials and media exposure. This article investigates another aspect of alcohol marketing in the Netherlands: the use of alcohol discounts by cafes. The prevalence of alcohol discounts was studied using unobtrusive cafe observations and website content analysis. It is estimated that 39% of the cafes offer some kind of cash discount for alcoholic beverages. The effects of alcohol discounts were investigated in a survey among adolescents (14-17 years old, N=409). Adolescents reported using alcohol discounts eight times a year, and consuming more alcohol when discounts were offered. Alcohol discounts, however, do not attract adolescents to visit particular cafes and/or to spend more money when going out. No differences were found between minors (16-17 years) and underage adolescents (14-15 years).

AB OBJECTIVE: This article reports the extent to which children (0-12 years) and teenagers below the legal drinking age in Australia (13-17 years) were exposed to alcohol advertising on free-to-air television in Sydney, Australia, during the period from March 2005 to February 2006.; METHOD: Exposure levels were obtained from weekly Target Audience Rating Points (TARPs) data generated by OzTAM, the official Australian television audience monitoring system. (The TARPs figure for an advertisement is calculated based on the number of individuals from a target audience [e.g., 13- to 17-year-olds] exposed to the ad as a proportion of the total number of individuals within the target audience, multiplied by 100). Exposure levels were obtained for four age groups-up to 12 years, 13-17 years, 18-24 years, and 25 years and older-for 156 different ads for 50 brands.; RESULTS: Adults 25 years and older were most exposed to alcohol advertising: approximately 660 TARPs per week. The level to which underage teenagers (13-17 years) were exposed to alcohol advertising was virtually identical to that of young adults (18-24 years): 426 TARPs per week vs 429 TARPs per week. Children (0-12 years) were exposed to approximately one in every three alcohol ads seen on average by mature adults (ages 25 years and older).; CONCLUSIONS: This study found that Australian children and teenagers below the legal drinking age currently are exposed to unacceptably high levels of alcohol advertising on television. These findings suggest that alcohol marketers may be deliberately targeting underage adolescents. At the very least the findings highlight the need for action to be taken to reduce levels to which underage Australians are exposed to alcohol advertising on television.

AB OBJECTIVE: To establish the school eating habits of Mexican children, who are prone to obesity and later to high rates of adult chronic diseases.; DESIGN: Questionnaires for students and parents with staff questionnaires and interviews.; SETTING: Randomly sampled schools in a socio-economically representative district of Mexico City.; SUBJECTS: Subjects were 1504 adolescents aged 10-19 years attending schools in Mexico City, 27 teachers and seven headmasters, sampled from both public and private schools and from the full range of socio-economic groups.; RESULTS: Foods brought from home were of a higher nutritional quality than those purchased at school, where purchases were dominated by crisps, soft drinks and other items with high energy density. Girls were more inclined to purchase inappropriately; those from poorer homes purchased less. Private-school students irrespective of socio-economic grade brought more food from home and purchased more expensive food at school. School policies allowed food and drink vendors to market any products within the schools, which benefited financially from these activities.; CONCLUSIONS: Current school food policies are conducive to amplifying the current epidemic of obesity and related adult chronic diseases, and need to change.

AB Alcohol consumption among young people in New Zealand is on the rise. Given the broad array of acute and chronic harms that arise from this trend, it is a major cause for alarm and it is imperative that we improve our knowledge of key drivers of youth drinking. Changes wrought by the neoliberal political climate of deregulation that characterised the last two decades in many countries including Aotearoa (Aotearoa is a Maori name for New Zealand) New Zealand have transformed the availability of alcohol to young people. Commercial development of youth alcohol markets has seen the emergence of new environments, cultures and practices around drinking and intoxication but the ways in which these changes are interpreted and taken up are not well understood. This paper reports findings from a qualitative research project investigating the meaning-making practices of young people in New Zealand in response to alcohol marketing. Research data included group interviews with a range of Maori and Pakeha young people at three time periods. Thematic analyses of the youth data on usages of marketing materials indicate naturalisation of tropes of alcohol intoxication. We show how marketing is used and enjoyed in youth discourses creating and maintaining what we refer to as intoxigenic social environments. The implications are considered in light of the growing exposure of young people to alcohol marketing in a discussion of strategies to manage and mitigate its impacts on behaviour and consumption.

AB Travel-related poisoning is an emerging social and public health emergency in Bangladesh but its cause and significance have not been determined. To investigate this syndrome we performed a prospective clinical study and retrospective analysis of hospital records in a general medicine unit of a public tertiary care teaching hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using toxicological analysis by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS). The participants of the prospective study were 130 consecutive patients aged 16-80 years who were admitted with central nervous system depression (Glasgow Coma Score 3-14) after using public transportation, in the absence of other abnormalities, from January through June 2004, and a convenience sample of 15 such patients admitted during 3 days in May 2006. In 2004-2006, travel-related poisoning increased from 6.1 to 9.5% of all admissions (210-309 of 3266-3843 per year), representing 46.6-55.7% of all admitted poisoning cases. Incidents were associated with bus (76%), taxi, train, and air travel, or local markets; 98% of patients remembered buying or accepting food or drinks before losing consciousness. Direct financial damage (missing property) was diverse and frequently existential. Among 94 urine samples analyzed by FPIA, 74% tested positive for benzodiazepines. Among 15 urine samples analyzed by LC-TOF MS, lorazepam was detected in all; five also contained diazepam or metabolites; nitrazepam was present in three. FPIA results obtained for these 15 samples were below the recommended cut-off in eight (53%; lorazepam only). Our findings show that the massive medicosocial emergency of travel-related poisoning in Bangladesh is the result of drug-facilitated organized crime and that benzodiazepine drugs are used to commit these crimes, suggesting modifications to the local emergency management of the victims of this type of poisoning. They also highlight the need for more research in the neglected field of acute poisoning in Bangladesh, and for criminal investigations of the use of benzodiazepine drugs in this country.

Risks for ND and AD were also due to genetic and unique environmental influences specific to each drug. A specific shared environmental factor contributed to CD.; CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the life-time co-occurrence of ND, AD and CD is due to common and specific genetic factors as well as unique environmental influences, and vulnerability for CD is also due to shared environmental factors that do not contribute to ND and AD. The majority of genetic variance is shared across drugs and the majority of unique environmental influences are drug-specific in these middle-aged men. Because differences between models allowing for specific genetic versus shared environment were small, we are most confident in concluding that there are specific familial contributions-either additive genetic or shared environment-to CD.

AB We examined changes and correlates of sexual risk behavior of men who have sex with men (MSM) compared with heterosexual men and women over three time periods. Data from the 1997, 1999, and 2003 Los Angeles County Health Surveys, a population-based telephone survey, were analyzed to examine the association of sociodemographic and health-related factors with sexual risk behaviors among the three groups. In each time period, MSM reported a significantly greater percentage of sexual risk (i.e., both inconsistent condom use and multiple sex partners in the past 12 months) compared with heterosexual men and women. Multivariate analyses indicated that MSM and heterosexual men reported greater sexual risk than heterosexual women. Respondents who were younger, U.S. born, reported heavy alcohol consumption, or had been tested for HIV in the past 24 months were more likely to report sexual risk behavior. The findings suggest the need for continued targeted prevention for MSM and prevention efforts for segments of the general population at elevated risk for HIV.

AB Occurrence and recurrences of suicidal ideation (SI) were modeled among boys/men assessed annually from ages 12 to 29 years. Multiple-spell discrete-time event-history analyses permitted (a) determination of whether risk for SI escalates with prior experiences of SI (spell effects), while (b) accounting for changes in risk with time (period effects) and (c) controlling for vulnerability factors. Self-reported SI (presence/absence in past week), depressive symptoms, alcohol/substance use, antisocial behavior, and official arrest records were collected annually from 205 boys recruited on the basis of community risk for delinquency. Parents' self-reported psychopathology and SES were collected in childhood. Period effects supported decreasing risk for SI over time. Spell and time-varying 1-year lagged substance use and depressive symptoms independently predicted increased risk for SI. Models involving SI with intent were explored. Consistent with interpersonal psychological theory, risk for young men's SI increases with past experience of SI, even with key propensities controlled. However, risk also decays over time. Targeting conditions that confer risk for SI is essential. Preventing and delaying SI occurrence and recurrence may represent independent mechanisms by which prevention efforts operate.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of obesity among elementary school female students and to identify some obesity-associated risk factors.; METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed healthy female school students (grades 4-6) during 2006-2007. Four private schools in North West Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were selected where the majority of high income families enrolled their daughters. One thousand and two hundred students were included. A pre-designed validated questionnaire was used for data collection. Weights and heights were measured, and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Students were categorized into obese and non-obese according to BMI by age scale.; RESULTS: A total of 1072 students participated in the study with a response rate of 89.3%. Obesity was prevalent among 14.9% of students. We observed that the proportion of obese students inversely increased by age and schooling grade (p<0.001). Ninety-five percent of the students living in villas or big houses were obese. Approximately 89.2% admitted that they are performing some exercises; however, 13.8% of them were obese. Consuming fast food and soft drinks were common practiced among obese students. Watching television on daily basis was prevalent among 97.5% of obese students.; CONCLUSION: The existence of obesity promoting factors, calls for integrating interventions at family and school level to match changes in social and cultural context. Awareness is needed to enhance healthy lifestyle.

Rates on having eaten deep fried food, pickled food, processed meat products, biscuits, coke or alike drinks, convenience/fast food, canned food, dried or preserved fruit, cold and sweet food, barbecue food etc. appeared to be 70.43%, 60.14%, 79.72%, 64.24%, 69.63%, 78.72%, 42.16%, 51.95%, 68.13%, 60.14% respectively. The rate on eaten more than once a day of these ten types were 26.95%, 36.88%, 34.84%, 32.97%, 27.40%, 28.18%, 37.91%, 26.15%, 37.39%, 22.10% respectively. The rates for "do not like" and "dislike" these ten types junk food were 10.96%, 27.42%, 7.08%, 12.11%, 6.56%, 6.59%, 17.80%, 13.59%, 3.42%, 5.19% respectively. Most of the children and adolescent ate junk food mainly during breakfast at home. Most of the surveyed children and adolescent did not have correct idea on nutrition of junk food. They received the information of junk food mainly from sources as advertisement on TV (67.95%), mother (9.02%), newspaper or magazines (6.71%). Many factors, such as individual factors (including physiological and psychological situations), social factors, family factors and the characteristics of food contributed to the eating junk food practices of children and adolescent.; CONCLUSION: Eating junk food is a popular event among children and adolescent in Beijing Haidian District. Education strategies on nutrition should be developed and launched in order to help children develop their own healthy eating behaviors.

AB PURPOSE: To examine cross-sectional associations between credit card debt, stress, and health risk behaviors among college students, focusing particularly on weight-related behaviors.; DESIGN: Random-sample, mailed survey.; SUBJECTS/SETTING: Undergraduate and graduate students (n = 3206) attending a large public university.; MEASURES: Self-reported health indicators (e.g., weight, height, physical activity, diet, weight control, stress, credit card debt).; RESULTS: More than 23% of students reported credit card debt > or = $1000. Using Poisson regression to predict relative risks (RR) of health behaviors, debt of at least $1000 was associated with nearly every risk indicator tested, including overweight/obesity, insufficient physical activity, excess television viewing, infrequent breakfast consumption, fast food consumption, unhealthy weight control, body dissatisfaction, binge drinking, substance use, and violence. For example, adjusted RR [ARR] ranged from 1.09 (95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.17) for insufficient vigorous activity to 2.17 (CI: 0.68-2.82) for using drugs other than marijuana in the past 30 days. Poor stress management was also a robust indicator of health risk.; CONCLUSION: University student lifestyles may be characterized by a variety of coexisting risk factors. These findings indicate that both debt and stress were associated with wide-ranging adverse health indicators. Intervention strategies targeting at-risk student populations need to be tailored to work within the context of the many challenges of college life, which may serve as barriers to healthy lifestyles. Increased health promotion efforts targeting stress, financial management, and weight-related health behaviors may be needed to enhance wellness among young adults.

AB This study explores the relationship between cancer newspaper coverage and public knowledge about cancer prevention, confirming self-reported associations between news exposure and cancer prevention knowledge with descriptions of newspaper coverage of modifiable cancer risks. Content analyses (N = 954) revealed that newspapers pay relatively little attention to cancer prevention. However, there is greater newspaper attention to tobacco and diet than to exercise, sun, and alcohol. Survey analysis (the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey) revealed that after controlling for differences based on gender, race, age, income, and education, attention to health news was significantly associated with knowledge about cancer risks associated with food and smoking but not for knowledge about exercise, sun, or alcohol. These findings conform to the findings of the content analysis data and provide a validation of a self-reported measure of media exposure, as well as evidence suggesting a threshold below which news coverage may not generate public knowledge about cancer prevention.

AB Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) continues to be the leading preventable cause of mental retardation in the United States. Because abstaining from alcohol prior to and throughout pregnancy is the only way to prevent FAS, some prevention programs try to target women before they become pregnant. The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Teaching and Research Awareness Campaign (FASTRAC) is a multimedia, peer-delivered educational presentation designed to reduce the incidence of FAS. Results from an ethnically diverse sample of high school students indicate that the program increased participants' knowledge regarding FAS but had no significant effect on participants' attitudes, beliefs about the dangers of FAS or intention to use alcohol during pregnancy. The FASTRAC program failed partly because of its didactic approach and the lack of health education principles that have been shown to be effective in changing other substance use behaviors. Suggestions for improving FAS prevention education programs are offered.

AB UNLABELLED: Social norms interventions are a common approach to addressing the problem of college student drinking. An increasingly popular but not yet well-validated social-norms-based intervention consists of providing normative feedback to students in small groups.; OBJECTIVE, PARTICIPANTS, AND METHODS: In this study, the authors used a randomized design to test an interactive form of small-group social norms correction with 502 first-year students during September and October 2001. Because the unit of random assignment was at the level of the classroom, the authors used hierarchical linear modeling to estimate variability. They investigated whether small-group interactive social norms correction could influence alcohol perceptions and behaviors above and beyond a noninteractive social norms education approach.; RESULTS: Results indicate that the approach has a fairly substantial influence on student perceptions; however, the findings do not support an influence of interactive small-group social norms correction on measures of alcohol use behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: Given these findings, the use of interactive small-group social norms approach to influence student misperceptions may be considered as a primer for population-level preventive interventions.

AB OBJECTIVE: The authors examined whether alcohol-related negative consequences decreased among students exposed to an intervention.; PARTICIPANTS: Beginning in 1999, approximately 2,500 randomly selected undergraduates from a 4-year US university annually participated in a Web-based survey over 6 years.; METHODS: The educational intervention used social norms initiatives. Main outcome measures included recall of intervention, estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC) when drinking, and 10 negative consequences from alcohol within the past year.; RESULTS: First-year students recalling exposure had lower odds of negative consequences (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64-0.95) and of having an eBAC higher than .08 (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.92). Over the 6 study years, the odds among all participants of experiencing (a) none of 10 alcohol consequences nearly doubled (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.82-2.49) and (b) multiple consequences decreased by more than half (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.36-0.50).; CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important implications for US colleges and universities engaged in the reduction of harm associated with alcohol misuse.

More than 50,000 students at 120 colleges took part in the study. This article reviews what we have learned about college drinking and the implications for prevention: the need to focus on lower drink thresholds, the harms produced at this level of drinking for the drinkers, the secondhand effects experienced by other students and neighborhood residents, the continuing extent of the problem, and the role of the college alcohol environment in promoting heavy drinking by students. In particular, the roles of campus culture, alcohol control policies, enforcement of policies, access, availability, pricing, marketing, and special promotions of alcohol are highlighted.

AB Underage drinking is a major public health problem. Youth drink more heavily than adults and are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of alcohol. Previous research has demonstrated the connection between alcohol advertising and underage drinking. Restricting outdoor advertising in general and transit ads in particular, represents an important opportunity to reduce youth exposure. To address this problem, the Marin Institute, an alcohol industry watchdog group in Northern California, conducted a survey of alcohol ads on San Francisco bus shelters. The survey received sufficient media attention to lead the billboard company, CBS Outdoor, into taking down the ads. Marin Institute also surveyed the 25 largest transit agencies; results showed that 75 percent of responding agencies currently have policies that ban alcohol advertising. However, as the experience in San Francisco demonstrated, having a policy on paper does not necessarily mean it is being followed. Communities must be diligent in holding accountable government officials, the alcohol industry, and the media companies through which advertising occurs.

AB Cigarettes with candy, fruit and alcohol flavors have been introduced in recent years as extensions to popular cigarette brands, raising concerns in the public health community that the enticing names, creative packaging, and intense flavorings of these products may be especially appealing to youth. This study used two national surveys to examine the prevalence of use of Camel Exotic Blends, Kool Smooth Fusion, and Salem Silver Label brands during 2004--2005 among older adolescents and young adult smokers aged 17-26 years and adult smokers aged > or =25 years. Overall use of any of these flavored brands in the past 30 days was 11.9% among smokers aged 17-26 years and 6.7% among smokers aged > or =25 years. A significant gradient in use was seen across age, with the highest rates of utilization among 17-year-old (22.8%) and 18-19-year-old smokers (21.7%) (p<.001). Uniquely flavored cigarette brands seem to be most attractive to the youngest smokers and should be prohibited.

AB AIMS: Immigrants are at increased risk of dying from external causes, particularly suicide. This study presents mortality data from a complete follow-up of a cohort of immigrants from the Former Soviet Union to Germany. Number of residential changes after migration and time period between residential change and death are analysed as predictors for suicide and other causes of mortality.; METHODS: A representative cohort of immigrants (n=34,393) was followed up until 31 December 2002. Residential changes were monitored through city registries. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated for all causes of death and external causes of death (suicides, accidents, other external causes) and deaths attributable to psychoactive substance use. Data on residential change were analysed using Poisson regression to examine differences in external-cause mortality among immigrants who changed residence after immigration. Mortality rates by time since changing residence were calculated, and linear regression analysis was performed to model the effect of cause of death on the time interval between residential change and death.; RESULTS: Male immigrants had a significantly higher risk of dying from external causes and suicide than Germans, and this increases with frequency of residential changes. Suicide mortality was significantly higher shortly after residential change. Linear regression showed that time to death after residential change was 2.5 times shorter for suicide than for any other cause.; CONCLUSIONS: High risk of death from external causes and from deaths attributable to substance abuse in immigrants suggests integration problems. Preventive efforts at targeted integration programmes for immigrants, in particular shortly after residential change, are recommended.

AB This study explored the consumers' and vendors' perceptions about Mondia whitei roots, in Kampala city, Uganda; determined the marketing margins and the market flow of the roots in the city; documented demand and supply opportunities as well as challenges to marketing of the roots by the vendors. Seventy vendors and 70 consumers of the roots were administered with semi-structured questionnaires. Results showed that M. whytei roots are largely perceived as sexual stimulant, appetiser, flavours for food and drinks, and stimulant for milk production in lactating mothers. Majority of the vendors (74%) and consumers (85%) perceived the trade in the roots as worthwhile. Men and adolescent boys were reported to be the main consumers. Retailers who buy the roots directly from collectors and later sell to consumers dominate the trade. The average price charged per piece and a kilogram of roots increases from collectors, middlemen and to the retailers. The average retail price was US $0.12 per piece of the root and US $1.50 per kg of the roots. Collectors charged the lowest price (US $0.06 and US $0.60 per piece and a kilogram of the roots respectively) though their profit margins remained the highest (50%). Several demand and supply opportunities exist for M. whytei roots and these included few sexual stimulant accepted alternatives to M. whytei roots in Kampala city; consumers' willingness to pay high prices when the roots are scarce, and a large number of M. whytei roots gatherers that could promote the cultivation of this plant for the market. Challenges, such as seasonal low supply of the roots, and unorganised market structure, hamper the trade in M. whytei roots. There is a need for experimental research on efficacies of the perceived uses of the roots reported in this study. The possibility of value addition to the roots sold should be investigated.

AB PROBLEM: Priority health-risk behaviors, which are behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults, often are established during childhood and adolescence, extend into adulthood, are interrelated, and are preventable.; REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: January--December 2007.; DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults, including behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 39 state surveys, and 22 local surveys conducted among students in grades 9--12 during 2007.; RESULTS: In the United States, 72% of all deaths among persons aged 10--24 years result from four causes: motor-vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 2007 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicated that many high school students engaged in behaviors that increased their likelihood of death from these four causes. Among high school students nationwide during 2007, 11.1% had never or rarely worn a seat belt when riding in a car driven by someone else. During the 30 days before the survey, 29.1% of high school students had ridden in a car or other vehicle driven by someone who had been drinking alcohol, 18.0% had carried a weapon, and 5.5% had not gone to school because they felt they would be unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. During the 12 months before the survey, 6.9% of high school students had attempted suicide. In addition, 75.0% of high school students had ever drunk alcohol, and 4.4% had ever used methamphetamines. Substantial morbidity and social problems among youth also result from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. Results from the 2007 survey indicated that 47.8% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 35.0% of high school students were currently sexually active, and 38.5% of currently sexually active high school students had not used a condom during last sexual intercourse. Among U.S. adults aged >or=25 years, 59% of all deaths result from two causes: cardiovascular disease and cancer. Results from the 2007 national YRBS indicated that risk behaviors associated with these two causes of death were present during adolescence. Among high school students nationwide during 2007, 20.0% had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days before the survey, 35.4% had watched television 3 or more hours per day on an average school day, and 13.0% were obese. During the 7 days before the survey, 78.6% of high school students had not eaten fruits and vegetables five or more times per day, 33.8% had drunk soda or pop at least one time per day, and 65.3% had not met recommended levels of physical activity.; INTERPRETATION: Since 1991, the prevalence of many health-risk behaviors among high school students nationwide has decreased. However, many high school students continue to engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. The prevalence of most risk behaviors does not vary substantially among cities and states.; PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: YRBS data are used to measure progress toward achieving 15 national health objectives for Healthy People 2010 and three of the 10 leading health indicators, to assess trends in priority health-risk behaviors among high school students, and to evaluate the impact of broad school and community interventions at the national, state, and local levels. More effective school health programs and other policy and programmatic interventions are needed to reduce risk and improve health outcomes among youth.

AB CONTEXT: While both environmental and genetic factors are important in the etiology of psychoactive substance use (PSU), we know little of how these influences differ through development.; OBJECTIVE: To clarify the changing role of genes and environment in PSU from early adolescence through middle adulthood.; DESIGN: Retrospective assessment by life history calendar, with univariate and bivariate structural modeling.; SETTING: General community.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1796 members of male-male pairs from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of use of alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, and nicotine recorded for every year of the respondent's life.; RESULTS: For nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis, familial environmental factors were critical in influencing use in early adolescence and gradually declined in importance through young adulthood. Genetic factors, by contrast, had little or no influence on PSU in early adolescence and gradually increased in their effect with increasing age. The sources of individual differences in caffeine use changed much more modestly over time. Substantial correlations were seen among levels of cannabis, nicotine, and alcohol use and specifically between caffeine and nicotine. In adolescence, those correlations were strongly influenced by shared effects from the familial environment. However, as individuals aged, more and more of the correlation in PSU resulted from genetic factors that influenced use of both substances.; CONCLUSIONS: These results support an etiologic model for individual differences in PSU in which initiation and early patterns of use are strongly influenced by social and familial environmental factors while later levels of use are strongly influenced by genetic factors. The substantial correlations seen in levels of PSU across substances are largely the result of social environmental factors in adolescence, with genetic factors becoming progressively more important through early and middle adulthood.

AB Alcohol expectancies have been associated with drinking behaviors among college students. Few studies, however, have focused on researcher-labeled "positive" and "negative" expectancies as well as the valuations (i.e., desirability) of these expectancies. Moreover, research on the correlates of heavy drinking among female college athletes remain relatively sparse, despite the prevalence of elevated alcohol use in this population. We examined the associations of expectancies and valuations with frequency of heavy drinking and context-specific drinking behaviors. The sample consisted of 145 female college athletes (mean age=19.6; range=17 to 22) who completed self-report surveys and indicated alcohol use in the past 30 days. Regression analyses indicated that favorable valuations of negative expectancies were related to heavy drinking, and that valuations accounted for significant proportions of variance in the model. Elevated endorsement of negative expectancies was also associated with the perceived likelihood of heavy use in convivial and personal-social drinking contexts, and favorable valuations of these expectancies accounted for significant variance in these models. These findings highlight the relevance of negative expectancies and valuations with respect to heavy drinking and context-specific drinking behaviors among female college athletes. The perception of "negative" effects of alcohol as "positive" could help explain the high rates of problematic drinking among female athletes. Future research considerations and potential implications for assessment and prevention efforts are discussed.

AB In this study, we examine whether adolescent emotional and behavior problems vary by history of early alcohol experiences. A national sample of 6974 alcohol-naive and 4337 alcohol-experienced youths aged 15-18 years were identified within the 2004 National Survey of Illegal Drug Use among Adolescents in Taiwan. Four alcohol experience groups were created based on recency and frequency of alcohol use: (1) naive; never drank alcohol, (2) trial use; first and only consumption of alcohol occurred more than 6 months preceding the assessment, (3) past use; alcohol used on more than one occasion but had not had a drink in the 6 months prior to the assessment, and (4) current use; consumed alcohol more than once and drank within the 6 months preceding the interview. A Chinese adaptation of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) assessed eight behavior syndromes: withdrawn, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, and aggressive behavior. Multivariate response models (GLM/GEE) were used to examine the relationship of alcohol experiences with emotional and behavior problems. Alcohol-using youth were more likely to experience several specific emotional or behavioral syndromes than their alcohol-naive counterparts. For example, youth with a history of alcohol use had an estimated 30-60% increase in the odds of experiencing items within the aggressive behavior syndrome as compared with alcohol-naive youth. The type of early alcohol involvement in adolescence may exert differential effects on emotions and behaviors expressed across and within syndromes; these may warrant distinctions in informing etiological research and preventive efforts.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine possible associations between active commuting (walking or cycling) to school, parameters of adiposity and lifestyle factors in 14-year-old adolescents of the Kiel Obesity Prevention Study.; SUBJECTS: A total of 626 14-year-old adolescents.; METHODS: Measured body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), distance to school as well as self-reported modes and duration of commuting to school, time spent in structured and unstructured physical activities (PAs), media use, nutrition, alcohol consumption and smoking.; RESULTS: Parameters of adiposity did not differ between different commuting modes after stratifying by gender. Active commuters reported higher overall PA, which was caused by commuting activity and time spent in unstructured PA in girls and just by commuting activity in boys. In active commuters, 28.4% of overall PA was explained by commuting activity. Additionally, TV viewing was lower in active commuters. Compared to their inactively commuting counterparts, actively commuting boys were less likely to smoke. After controlling for potential confounders the interaction term 'active commuting by distance to school' and 'time spent in structured PA' were independent predictors of FM, whereas active commuting by itself showed no effect.; CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that active commuting to school per se does not affect FM or BMI until considering distance to school. Increasing walking or cycling distance results in decreasing FM. However, the everyday need to get to and from school may enhance adolescents' overall PA.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to explore whether parents of overweight adolescents who recognize that their children are overweight engage in behaviors that are likely to help their adolescents with long-term weight management.; METHODS: The study population included overweight adolescents (BMI >/= 85th percentile) who participated in Project EAT (Eating Among Teens) I (1999) and II (2004) and their parents who were interviewed by telephone in Project EAT I. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted with 314 adolescent-parent dyads, and longitudinal analyses were completed with 170 dyads.; RESULTS: Parents who correctly classified their children as overweight were no more likely than parents who did not correctly classify their children as overweight to engage in the following potentially helpful behaviors: having more fruits/vegetables and fewer soft drinks, salty snacks, candy, and fast food available at home; having more family meals; watching less television during dinner; and encouraging children to make healthful food choices and be more physically active. However, parents who recognized that their children were overweight were more likely to encourage them to diet. Parental encouragement to diet predicted poorer adolescent weight outcomes 5 years later, particularly for girls. Parental classification of their children's weight status did not predict child weight status 5 years later.; CONCLUSIONS: Accurate classification of child overweight status may not translate into helpful behaviors and may lead to unhealthy behaviors such as encouragement to diet. Instead of focusing on weight per se, it may be more helpful to direct efforts toward helping parents provide a home environment that supports healthful eating, physical activity, and well-being.

AB In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effect on tobacco use onset among middle school students of Family Communications (FC) activities designed to mobilize parental influences against tobacco use and Youth Anti-tobacco Activities (YAT) designed to market anti-tobacco norms to adolescents. We conducted a simple, two-condition experimental design in which 40 middle schools, with a prevalence of tobacco use at or above the Oregon median, received, by random assignment, either the intervention or no intervention. State, county, and local prevention coordinators around Oregon served as liaisons to schools. To generate interest, staff made presentations to these groups and distributed marketing packets at several conferences. Dependent variables were indices of smoking prevalence and use of smokeless tobacco (ST) in the prior month. Additionally, we created an intervention manual so that other communities could replicate this study. The findings suggest that efforts to influence parents to discourage their children's tobacco use and efforts to market an anti-tobacco perspective to teens are effective in preventing smoking. The impact of YAT is consistent with experimental and nonexperimental evaluations of media campaigns to influence young people not to smoke.

AB The limited efficacy of prior eating disorder (ED) prevention programs led to the development of dissonance-based interventions (DBIs) that utilize dissonance-based persuasion principles from social psychology. Although DBIs have been used to change other attitudes and behaviors, only recently have they been applied to ED prevention. This article reviews the theoretical rationale and empirical support for this type of prevention program. Relative to assessment-only controls, DBIs have produced greater reductions in ED risk factors, ED symptoms, future risk for onset of threshold or subthreshold EDs, future risk for obesity onset, and mental health utilization, with some effects persisting through 3-year follow-up. DBIs have also produced significantly stronger effects than alternative interventions for many of these outcomes, though these effects typically fade more quickly. A meta-analysis indicated that the average effects for DBIs were significantly stronger than those for non-DBI ED prevention programs that have been evaluated. DBIs have produced effects when delivered to high-risk samples and unselected samples, as well as in efficacy and effectiveness trials conducted by six independent labs, suggesting that the effects are robust and that DBIs should be considered for the prevention of other problems, such as smoking, substance abuse, HIV, and diabetes care.

AB This research expands the user/nonuser dichotomy commonly used in research on marijuana. By conceptualizing nonusers as homogeneous, vital nuances in susceptibility to risk and protective factors may be overlooked. Research operations tested the predictive validity of a brief measure that divided nonusers into resolute and vulnerable subcategories; determined whether variables that distinguished nonusers and users were more informative when a tripartite classification was used; and with an eye on future prevention, examined variables on which resolute nonusers were similar to vulnerable nonusers or users, and on which they differed from both. A nationally representative sample of respondents (N = 2,111; ages 12-16 years) from the National Survey of Parents and Youth was used in this secondary analysis. Panel data gathered yearly over four rounds included information on intentions and use of marijuana and other illicit substances, along with social, demographic, intrapersonal, and parental variables. The three groups differed significantly on associates' marijuana use, participants' approval of others' use, and cigarette and alcohol use. Resolute nonusers differed from vulnerable nonusers and users alike on religiosity, delinquency (self and friends'), refusal strength, sensation seeking, parental monitoring and warmth, and adult supervision. Results support the utility of distinguishing vulnerable from resolute nonusers, counsel against considering nonusers as a homogeneous group, and provide insight into variables that might prove useful in future prevention efforts.

AB OBJECTIVE: The initiation of teen driving, which occurs between ages 15 and 17, has generally been studied primarily in relation to crash injury reduction. However, it may be the most important period influencing development between puberty and emerging adulthood because, once the teens are driving on their own or riding with other teens, parental control over social behavior is greatly reduced and opportunities for risk-taking are substantially increased. The noncrash risks and benefits of licensing during this critical transition period are the subject of this paper.; METHODS: We identify "transition teens" as a subgroup of all 15-to 17-year-olds who reside in middle-class suburban and rural areas where families can afford a car and where a vehicle is needed for reasonable mobility. In this paper, we review recent studies on the effect of driving on non-traffic-related behaviors of teen drivers. Our analysis suggests that there are two environments that affect behavior and development: the home environment and the extended environment. Before driving age, the home environment influences are omnipresent in the life of the developing child. However, once teens can move more readily within the community and travel outside the home environment on their own or with a peer, they have access to locations where many or all the local controls on risky behavior may be absent.; RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This article introduces the concept of "transitional teens" and provides a rough model that explains the possible risks encountered by this group when they begin to drive a vehicle or to ride with a peer. We offer this model to the research community with a challenge to hypothesize, test, and explore this proposed transitional period so that we can better understand and mitigate its associated risks.

AB In 2006, approximately 70 million persons in the United States participated in recreational boating, and paddle sports vessels (i.e., canoes, kayaks, and inflatable rafts) made up the fastest-growing segment of the boating market. From 2005 to 2006, canoe sales in the United States increased by 23%, and kayak sales increased by 11%, while powerboat sales decreased by 5%. To analyze the trends and characteristics of deaths associated with paddle sports, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services examined data on fatalities that occurred during 2000-2007. The results of this analysis determined that paddle sports deaths were associated with inexperience, alcohol use, and not using a personal flotation device (PFD). To reduce the risk for paddle sports fatalities, boating organizations and water-sport enforcement agencies should encourage boater safety education, use of PFDs, and avoidance of alcohol before and during boating.

AB The current assessment was undertaken to examine the link between drug use and sexual risk behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM) in locations known to have high prevalence rates of drug use and sexual risk behavior in Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria, South Africa. Street intercepts and purposive snowball sampling were used to recruit drug-using MSM. A rapid assessment was undertaken which included observation, mapping, key informant interviews and focus group interviews with MSM. Drug using key informants were tested for HIV. The use of drugs like crack cocaine, cannabis and methamphetamine to specifically facilitate sexual encounters was evident. Drugs led to inconsistent condom use and other high-risk sexual activities despite HIV risk knowledge being high. Many injecting drug-using MSM shared needles and reused equipment. Among MSM who agreed to HIV testing, one-third tested positive. Views about drug and HIV treatment and preventive services and their efficacy were mixed. Various barriers to accessing services were highlighted including homosexual stigmatization and availability of drugs in treatment facilities. Recommendations include addressing the gap between HIV-risk knowledge and practice, extending VCT services for MSM, increasing the visibility of drug abuse services within communities, addressing concerns about drug availability in treatment centers as well as reintegration issues and the need for after-care services, reducing stigmatization in drug and HIV services for MSM and finally, strengthening the link between drug treatment services and HIV prevention by integrating HIV/drug-related risks into HIV prevention efforts and HIV risks into drug use prevention efforts.

AB The objective of the study was to assess the relations of socioeconomic and behavioral factors to frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened soda among New York City (NYC) adults and the relation of frequent consumption to body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)). Data from the 2005 NYC Community Health Survey, a population-based telephone survey, were analyzed. Frequent consumption was defined as drinking one or more 12-oz servings of sugar-sweetened soda on an average day; 9,865 adults, aged 18 years and older, provided valid responses. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with frequent consumption, and linear regression models were used to assess the relation of frequent consumption to BMI. An estimated 27.5% of NYC adults are frequent sugar-sweetened soda consumers. Frequent consumption is independently associated with low household income (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.1 for <200% vs. > or =600% federal poverty level) and with ethnic group and nativity (e.g., OR = 3.1, 95% CI 2.6-3.7 for U.S.-born blacks vs. whites). Men report more consumption then women, but an association of less education with frequent consumption is stronger among women. Adjusting for demographics, frequent consumption is associated with more television viewing and with less physical activity. Adjusting for demographics and behaviors, frequent consumption was associated with higher BMI among women (0.7 BMI units, 95% CI 0.1-1.2) but not among men. Disparities in sugar-sweetened soda consumption mirror obesity disparities. Improved surveillance and interventions are needed to better quantify and reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, especially in groups most impacted by obesity.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify risky sexual behaviours and demographic factors that place high-school pupils at risk of HIV and AIDS.; METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to explore factors influencing the sexual behaviour of high-school pupils (mean age 15.4 years; SD 1.11). Structured self-reported questionnaires were completed by all grade 10 pupils (N = 805) at all the Wentworth, Durban, public high schools.; RESULTS: Significant gender differences in sexual practices were reported, such as males being more likely to engage in sexual activity than females (OR 4.92; p < 0.001). More males (24.8%) initiated sex before age 12, compared with more females (30%) who initiated sex between 16 to 20 years of age (p < 0.001). Significantly more males preferred older partners than females (p = 0.002), more females were forced to have sex than males (p = 0.009), and more males used alcohol on the last occasion of sex than females (p = 0.04). Religious affiliation and parental supervision were found to have a significant effect on sexual activity among pupils.; CONCLUSIONS: High-school pupils are at high risk of HIV and AIDS, yet they continue to engage in risky sexual behaviours. Preventive efforts therefore need to be aggressively up-scaled and redirected towards specific risky practices, taking gender differences into account. Contextual factors such as religious norms and parental supervision also require greater attention. Risky sexual behaviours are reflective of a broader crisis in society.

AB BACKGROUND: The behavioral pathways through which television (TV) viewing leads to increased adiposity in adults are unclear.; OBJECTIVE: We wanted to determine whether the association between TV viewing and abdominal obesity in young adults is mediated by food and beverage consumption during TV viewing time or by a reduction in overall leisure-time physical activity (LTPA).; DESIGN: This study involved a cross-sectional analysis of data from 2001 Australian adults aged 26-36 y. Waist circumference (WC) was measured at study clinics, and TV viewing time, frequency of food and beverage consumption during TV viewing, LTPA, and demographic characteristics were self-reported.; RESULTS: Women watching TV > 3 h/d had a higher prevalence of severe abdominal obesity (WC: > or = 88 cm) compared with women watching < or = 1 h/d [prevalence ratio (PR): 1.89; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.71]. Moderate abdominal obesity (WC: 94-101.9 cm) was more prevalent in men watching TV > 3 h/d than in men watching < or = 1 h/d (PR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.37, 3.41). Adjustment for LTPA made little difference, but adjustment for food and beverage consumption during TV viewing attenuated the associations (PR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.17 for women; PR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.83 for men).; CONCLUSIONS: The association between TV viewing and WC in young adults may be partially explained by food and beverage consumption during TV viewing but was not explained by a reduction in overall LTPA. Other behaviors likely contribute to the association between TV viewing and obesity.

AB AIMS: Following an ecological model to specify risks for impaired driving, we assessed the effects of youth attitudes about substance use and their experiences of riding in cars with adults and peers who drove after drinking alcohol or smoking cannabis on the youths' own driving after drinking or using cannabis.; DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 2594 students in grades 10 and 12 (mean age = 16 years and 2 months; 50% girls) from public high schools in urban (994) and rural communities (1600) on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada; 1192 of these were new drivers with restricted licenses. Self-report data were collected in anonymous questionnaires. Regression analyses were used to assess the independent and interacting effects of youth attitudes about substance use and their experiences of riding in cars with adults or peers who drove after drinking alcohol or smoking cannabis on youth driving.; FINDINGS: Youth driving risk behaviors were associated independently with their own high-risk attitudes and experiences riding with peers who drink alcohol or use cannabis and drive. However, risks were highest for the youth who also report more frequent experiences of riding with adults who drink alcohol or use cannabis and drive.; CONCLUSIONS: Prevention efforts should be expanded to include the adults and peers who are role models for new drivers and to increase youths' awareness of their own responsibilities for their personal safety as passengers.

AB Past research related to alcohol advertising examined whether underage adolescents were targets of the alcohol industry and what impact such advertising had on adolescent drinking. The purpose of this study was to longitudinally examine the impact of media resistance skills on subsequent drinking among adolescents residing in inner-city regions of New York City. The study also tested whether drug skill refusal techniques (knowing how to say no to alcohol and other drugs) mediated the relationship between media resistance skills and adolescent drinking. A panel sample of baseline, one-year and two-year follow-ups (N=1318) from the control group of a longitudinal drug abuse prevention trial participated. A series of structural equations models showed that media resistance skills directly negatively predicted alcohol use 2 years later and that drug skill refusal techniques mediated this effect. Baseline media resistance skills were associated with one-year drug skill refusal techniques, which in turn negatively predicted two-year alcohol use. These findings provided empirical support for including media resistance skills and drug skill refusal techniques in alcohol prevention programs.

AB BACKGROUND: The development of alcohol dependence (AD) involves transitions through multiple stages of drinking behaviors and is shaped by both heritable and environmental influences. We attempted to capture this dynamic process by characterizing genetic and environmental contributions to the rate at which women progressed through 3 significant transitions along the pathway to AD: nonuse to initiation, initiation to onset of first alcohol-related problem, and first problem to onset of AD.; METHODS: The sample consisted of 3,546 female twins from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 29 years. Retrospective reports of alcohol use histories were collected by telephone diagnostic interview and transition times between drinking milestones were coded ordinally. Standard genetic analyses were conducted in Mx to derive a trivariate model that provided estimates of genetic and environmental influences that were common as well as specific to the 3 transition times.; RESULTS: Heritable influences were found for rate of progression across all 3 transitions, accounting for 30 to 47% of the variance in transition times. Shared environmental contributions were evident only in rate of progression from nonuse to initiation (i.e., age at first drink). Heritable contributions to the rate of movement through successive drinking milestones were attributable to a common factor, whereas environmental influences were transition-specific.; CONCLUSIONS: The current study is unique in its use of a genetically informative design to document the rate of movement between drinking milestones in a female sample and to examine genetic contributions to multiple transition times over the course of AD development. Results indicate that an earlier report of heritability for males in rate of progression from regular drinking to AD generalizes to women and to other alcohol stage transitions. Findings also suggest the need to consider stage-specific environmental contributions to alcohol outcomes in developing interventions.

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine social contexts and processes influencing transition to drug injection among street youth.; METHODS: 42 street youth participated in in-depth interviews. A typology of experiences was built founded on youth's street life and drug use trajectories. The transition to drug injection was examined through these experiences.; RESULTS: We identified five types of mutually exclusive experiences. The "downtowner's" experience is characterised by early street life and drug consumption trajectories, and a strong identification with the downtown milieu. These youth progress from one drug to another and, in a milieu where drug injection is omnipresent, this escalation culminates in transition to injection. The "tripper" street life and substance use trajectories begin later and are less intense. Most "tripper" youth are already chronic hallucinogens users when they arrive in downtown Montreal. Although they judge "junkies" severely, they show some ambivalence towards injection. The "on the go" experience is characterised by trajectories of drug use and street life that are intermingled, leading to a loss of control. These youth, who often have serious delinquent behaviours, come to downtown Montreal to party and consume drugs, mostly stimulants. Their drug use pattern and network make them at high risk of starting cocaine injection. The "hard-luck's" experience is characterised by a lack of identification with the downtown milieu. These youth who use drugs recreationally, end up in the streets accidentally, often because of unemployment. The "alcoholic' experience is related to alcohol misuse. These youth usually end up in the streets due to this dependence. Their street involvement is mostly an experience of solitude. The risk of transitioning to injection for both these types is low.; CONCLUSIONS: Some combinations of street life and drug use trajectories seem to contribute to injection among street youth. Some important factors interact and increase the risk of street youth transitioning to injection: poor personal assets; early rupture with primary social institutions; social integration into subcultures where both street life and "drug trips" are fashionable, drug preferences and the local drug market.

AB In this paper, we study the effects of youth readership, price of advertisements, and audience size on alcohol advertising in 35 major magazines. The regressions also account for readership demographics (adult reader age, income, gender, race), magazine characteristics (newsstand sales, number of annual issues), and type of beverage (beer, wine, spirits). Using count data models, the results indicate significant effects for price, audience size, and adult demographics, but fail to support claims that alcohol advertisers target adolescent readers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is a growing problem among adolescents, but little is known about self-management behaviors in this population. Our aim was to examine self-management behaviors and glycemic control among adolescents with type 2 diabetes.; METHODS: From 2003 to 2005, a telephone survey of adolescents with type 2 diabetes was performed. Chart review obtained most recent glycated hemoglobin and clinical characteristics. Analyses compared patient characteristics and self-management behaviors to recent glycated hemoglobin levels.; RESULTS: Of 139 patients contacted, 103 (74%) completed the study. The mean age was 15.4 years: 69% were girls, 47% were white, and 46% were black. Mean glycated hemoglobin was 7.7%, and the average duration of diabetes was 2.0 years. More than 80% of patients reported > or = 75% medication compliance, and 59% monitored blood glucose > 2 times daily. However, patients reported frequent episodes of overeating, drinking sugary drinks, and eating fast food. More than 70% of patients reported exercising > or = 2 times a week, but 68% reported watching > or = 2 hours of television daily. Nonwhite patients had higher glycated hemoglobin and hospitalizations per year compared with white patients. In multivariable analyses, nonwhite race remained significantly associated with higher glycated hemoglobin even after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, insurance status, and other factors. Nonwhite patients were more likely to watch > or = 2 hours of television per day (78% vs 56%), to report exercising < or = 1 time per week (35% vs 21%), and to drink > or = 1 sugary drink daily (27% vs 13%).; CONCLUSION: Although patients reported good medication and monitoring adherence, they also reported poor diet and exercise habits and multiple barriers. Nonwhite race was significantly associated with poorer glycemic control even after adjusting for covariates. This may, in part, be related to disparities in lifestyle behaviors. Additional studies are indicated to further assess self-management behaviors and potential racial disparities in adolescents with type 2 diabetes.

AB BACKGROUND: Knowledge concerning the epidemiology of suicide in Sri Lanka is limited despite its suicide rates being amongst the highest in the world.; AIM: To examine the characteristics of a large sample of Sri Lankan suicides to inform approaches to prevention.; METHOD: Psychological autopsy study of suicides occurring in three rural districts of Sri Lanka during August-October 1997.; RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with contacts of 372 (74%) of the 499 suicides that occurred over the study period. Males accounted for 79% of the deaths. Twenty-one percent of male and 57% of female suicides were aged <25 years of age. Pesticide self-poisoning accounted for 259 (70%) of the deaths. Almost two-thirds (62%) of the deaths occurred in hospital and 95 (26%) had made previous suicidal gestures. 138 (37%) were moderately or severely depressed and 144 (49%) of male suicides, but only 2 (2.5%) of the females, were alcohol dependent. Illegally brewed alcohol (kasippu) was the main product used by two thirds (62%) of problem drinkers. There was a family history of suicide in 20% of cases.; CONCLUSION: Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for over two thirds of suicides in rural Sri Lanka. Suicide prevention efforts in Sri Lanka should focus on restricting access to pesticides, improving the medical management of pesticide poisoning, reducing alcohol misuse-particularly targeting the supply of illegal alcohol-and improving the identification and aftercare of people who self-harm.

AB AIMS: To investigate alcohol drinking among urban Chinese and any changes between 2002 and 2005.; DESIGN: Two identical face-to-face interviews were carried out with two random samples with 2327 and 2613 respondents, respectively.; SETTING: Respondents were selected randomly from Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, between May and June 2002, and June and August 2005.; PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen to 65-year-old urban Chinese adults.; MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of drinking, frequency of drinking, typical occasion quantity, volume of annual consumption and heavier drinking were the main measures.; FINDINGS: Nearly three-quarters (90% for men and 55% for women) were current alcohol drinkers in 2005, and the prevalence of drinking alcohol had increased significantly since 2002 among both men and women; the largest increases occurred in the younger group (18-19 years) and among older women. There was no change in the frequency of drinking, the average quantities consumed by drinkers and the volume of absolute alcohol consumed by drinkers over this 3-year period. However, reflecting the increased prevalence of drinkers, the median volumes of absolute alcohol consumed in the sample as a whole had increased significantly. Older males were more likely to be categorized as larger-quantity drinkers: 30-65-year-old men accounted for 63%. There was also an increase over time in the proportion of larger-quantity drinkers: the proportion of male larger-quantity drinkers increased from 27% in 2002 to 35% in 2005.; CONCLUSIONS: In the urban setting of Wuhan, over the time-period 2002-05, there was an increase in prevalence of drinkers, particularly among younger people and older women. The average frequency and quantities consumed by drinkers did not change over this period; among drinking men the volumes of alcohol consumed were comparable to those in much more saturated commercial alcohol markets. The results did, however, show an increase over time in the proportion of older men who were engaged in heavier drinking and, in 2005, the proportion exceeded that in more saturated markets. These data suggest that, given the relatively high levels of consumption among established drinking groups, increases in the prevalence of drinkers over time may result in increases in harm if effective policies are not implemented.

AB AIMS: The growing consumption of alcopops (highly sweetened pre-mixed spirit-based drinks especially designed and marketed for adolescents and young adults) among adolescents below the minimum age has given rise to the suspicion that these designer drinks are conducive to encouraging young people to prematurely drink alcohol. Increasing concern with regard to the health of young people has prompted several countries to respond to the growing consumption of alcopops with the introduction of special taxes. The present review aims to analyse the relationship between alcopop consumption and expected negative consequences, in particular, with regard to the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumed, the number of negative alcohol-related consequences, the consumption of other drugs, and engagement in further risk behaviours.; METHODS: Systematic computer-assisted literature searches in Pub Med, PsycINFO, and Addiction Abstracts used the keywords 'alcopop', 'alcopops', 'designer drink', or 'designer drinks'. All publications relating to alcopops and their impact on adolescent drinking were included.; RESULTS: An analysis of existing studies shows that on the grounds of methodological limitations, such as not controlling for total alcohol consumption, evidence of an association between the consumption of alcopops and the effects mentioned above is scarce. Results rather indicate a clear relationship between the quantity of alcohol consumed and alcohol-related negative consequences.; CONCLUSIONS: In place of beverage-specific interventions, a successful alcohol policy should look to implement evidence-based measures for the reduction of total alcohol consumption.

AB Guarana (Paullinia cupana) extracts are most commonly used in Western markets as putatively psychoactive food and drink additives. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel groups study assessed the acute effects of either a vitamin/mineral/guarana supplement or placebo drink in 129 healthy young adults (18-24 years). Participants completed a 10min version of the Cognitive Demand Battery (comprising: Serial 3s and Serial 7s subtraction tasks, a Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) task, 'mental fatigue' scale). Thirty minutes following their drink participants made six consecutive completions of the battery (i.e. 60 min). The vitamin/mineral/guarana combination resulted in improved task performance, in comparison to placebo, in terms of both increased speed and accuracy of performing the RVIP task throughout the post-dose assessment. The increase in mental fatigue associated with extended task performance was also attenuated by the supplement. This research supports previous findings demonstrating guarana's cognition enhancing properties and provides evidence that its addition to a multi-vitamin-mineral supplement can improve cognitive performance and reduce the mental fatigue associated with sustained mental effort.

AB It is of no coincidence that a number of recent Harm Reduction Digests have addressed the issue of the reduction of alcohol-related harm. Despite the dominant focus on illicit drug use in the popular discourse, alcohol remains Australia's number one drug problem, as it is in many other developed countries. In this Digest Munro and de Wever use the 'four Ps' of marketing: product, price, place and promotion, to critique the two decades industry self-regulation of alcohol marketing. They conclude that if we are going to develop policies which effectively change Australian drinking culture to reduce alcohol-related harm, we need first to accept that the alcohol industry and the health field have separate and conflicting interests.

Recordings were then viewed to identify social behaviors of interest.; RESULTS: Each hour on average, sex was referenced 1.8 times, drugs 0.6 times, tobacco 0.3 times, alcohol 2.4 times, and violence/crime 6.0 times per network. Messages advocating exercise, anti-drug advocacy, and anti-smoking advocacy were each shown 0.2 times per hour; while anti-alcohol advocacy was shown 0.1 times per hour.; CONCLUSION: School educators, health professionals, and parents must recognize that prime-time television frequently exposes viewers to issues that are of critical importance to the health and social development of school-aged children and adolescents.

AB QUESTION: How does health misinformation become part of the American and Canadian vernacular?; DATA SOURCES AND SELECTION: Twenty-three databases were searched for articles discussing university freshmen weight gain. Research articles were examined for methodology, number and gender of the participants and weight gain. Popular press articles were reviewed for the types of information published: expert/anecdotal, weight gain, nutrition, exercise, health and alcohol. A timeline of article publication dates was generated.; RESULTS: Twenty peer-reviewed, 19 magazine, 146 newspaper, and 141 university newspaper articles were discovered. Appearance of media articles about the 'Freshman 15' mirrored the peer-reviewed articles, yet the information did not reliably depict the research. Research indicated a weight gain of less than five pounds (2.268 kg), while half of the popular press publications claimed a 15-pound (6.804 kg) weight gain. The misinformation was frequently accompanied by information about achieving weight control through diet, exercise, stress reduction and alcohol avoidance.; CONCLUSION: Understanding of how the concept of the 'Freshman 15' developed indicates that remediation efforts are needed. Collaborative efforts between health science and academic librarians, faculty and journalists to construct new paradigms for the translation of scientific evidence into information that individuals can use for decisions about health and well-being is suggested.

AB BACKGROUND: Binge drinking has been highlighted as a growing problem in the UK, particularly amongst females aged 18-25 years. University of Leeds is situated within a population that has one of the highest reported statistics of binge drinking in the UK. In September 2006, the 'Unit 1421' campaign was launched at University of Leeds with the aim to promoted sensible drinking amongst students. The aim of this study is to explore female perspectives on binge drinking and on 'Unit 1421' campaign in the University of Leeds.; METHODS: Using a purposive sample, two focus groups were conducted with 12 female students aged 18-23 years within university grounds. Participants were recruited via email and poster advertisements on campus.; RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the data: (i) lay perception of binge drinking; (ii) pressures of matching the drinking patterns of male peers; (iii) student rite of passage; (iv) evaluation of the 'Unit 1421' campaign.; CONCLUSION: The social context of student life impacts greatly upon students' choices to binge drink. The norms, beliefs and morals governing student culture and the use of alcohol to assert identity should be considered when tailoring health promotion efforts to this target audience. Larger qualitative and ultimately quantitative studies are warranted to extrapolate and test the social pressures on drinking in this age group.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to develop reliable procedures to monitor the content of alcohol advertisements broadcast on television and in other media, and to detect violations of the content guidelines of the alcohol industry's self-regulation codes.; METHOD: A set of rating-scale items was developed to measure the content guidelines of the 1997 version of the U.S. Beer Institute Code. Six focus groups were conducted with 60 college students to evaluate the face validity of the items and the feasibility of the procedure. A test-retest reliability study was then conducted with 74 participants, who rated five alcohol advertisements on two occasions separated by 1 week.; RESULTS: Average correlations across all advertisements using three reliability statistics (r, rho, and kappa) were almost all statistically significant and the kappas were good for most items, which indicated high test-retest agreement. We also found high interrater reliabilities (intraclass correlations) among raters for item-level and guideline-level violations, indicating that regardless of the specific item, raters were consistent in their general evaluations of the advertisements.; CONCLUSIONS: Naive (untrained) raters can provide consistent (reliable) ratings of the main content guidelines proposed in the U.S. Beer Institute Code. The rating procedure may have future applications for monitoring compliance with industry self-regulation codes and for conducting research on the ways in which alcohol advertisements are perceived by young adults and other vulnerable populations.

AB OBJECTIVE: Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15-to 20-year-olds. In 2004, nearly 8,000 15to 20-year-old drivers were killed in crashes. Epidemiologic studies repeatedly identify overrepresentation of young males in fatal crashes. Recent studies of young females and risk-taking behaviors (drug use, violent crime, risky sexual behavior) show unfavorable trends. The objective of this study is to study the extent of contribution of young female drivers to national fatal crashes over and to uncover unfavorable trends linked to risky driving behavior.; METHODS: Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS) on drivers in crashes with one or more fatalities during 1995-2004 were studied. Five age groups were used: 16, 17, 18, 19-20, and 21-24 years. Linear regression was used to measure trends over time. The regression results represent differences in proportions and changes in proportion of crashes that fell into specified categories. The FARS multiple imputation data sets was used to estimate the proportion of drivers with positive blood alcohol, and variance estimates were corrected for the imputation procedure.; RESULTS: In all, 139,000 fatal crashes involving the noted age groups occurred over 10 years. Safety restraint use: Females had more safety restraint use (by 17.8%) but a smaller increase in use over time. Driver's license validity: The percentage of valid licensure decreased over the study for young males and females both in the general population and among drivers in fatal crashes. Single-vehicle crashes: A lower proportion of female drivers (8.9% fewer) were involved in single-vehicle fatal crashes. This proportion changed little over the study period. Alcohol use: Females had a 16.7% lower proportion than males of alcohol involvement in fatal crashes. This lower proportion was seen throughout the age groups. When accounting for change over the study period, female drivers had a similar to male increase in alcohol-involved fatal crashes. Presence of peer passengers: Female drivers were less likely to have age peers as passengers.; CONCLUSIONS: While young male drivers surpass young females in number of fatal crashes, there are unfavorable trends linked to crash fatalities in young females. Our results suggest a smaller increase in safety restraint use, proportional decrease in license validity, and an increase in rate of alcohol-involved fatal crashes that approaches that seen in young males. These findings have considerable implications for future traffic safety social marketing campaigns, programs, and interventions.

AB BACKGROUND: Constructs such as drinking expectancies (beliefs regarding the effects of alcohol) and motives (drinking alcohol to achieve a valued end) have been shown to be associated with various stages of alcohol use behaviors. However, little is known of the extent to which genetic and environmental influences contribute to individual differences in expectancies and motives.; METHODS: Using data from 3,656 young adult same-sex female twins, we examined the association between measures of drinking expectancies and motives and drinking behaviors. Using twin models, we estimated the extent to which genetic, shared and non-shared environmental factors influenced individual differences in expectancies and motives and also tested whether the extent of the genetic and environmental contributions on expectancies varied across abstainers and users of alcohol.; RESULTS: Expectancies predicted initiation of alcohol use. Both motives and expectancies were associated with frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption and drinks-to-intoxication. There was no evidence for heritable influences on expectancies and enhancement motives, with familial similarity for these traits being due to shared environment. Heritable influences on social, coping and conformity motives ranged from 11% to 33%. When expectancies were stratified by alcohol use, significant heritable influences (31-39%) were found for cognitive-behavioral impairment and risk-taking/negative self-perception (RT/NSP) in abstainers only, while environmental influences contributed to familial variance for other measures of expectancies in alcohol users.; CONCLUSIONS: Environmental influences (both familial and individual-specific) shape alcohol expectancies, while heritable influences may predispose to motives for drinking. Individual differences in expectancies are moderated by alcohol use, suggesting that sources of individual differences in expectancies may vary in drinkers versus abstainers.

AB The present study explores the relations among gender, impulsivity and three health-risk behaviors relevant to young adults (tobacco use, alcohol problems and gambling problems) in a sample of 197 college-age individuals. We sought to determine whether impulsivity is associated with health-risk behaviors in the same ways for men and women. For tobacco use and gambling problems, men were at higher risk than women, and impulsivity was not significantly associated with higher risk. Higher levels of motor impulsivity in men accounted for a significant amount of the gender difference in risk for alcohol problems. That is, impulsivity as measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (version 11), mediated the association between gender and risk for alcohol problems. For impulsivity as measured by Stop Signal Reaction Time (i.e. response inhibition), gender moderated the association between impulsivity and alcohol problems. Specifically, lower levels of impulsivity were associated with greater risk for alcohol problems in both men and women, but the effect was stronger in men. We speculate that this seemingly paradoxical result might be the result of coping drinking to deal with negative affect associated with behavioral overcontrol. These findings suggest that prevention efforts might well focus on identifying individuals at high risk for alcohol problems, especially males, by assessing response inhibition.

AB The present study examined students' understanding and perceived effectiveness of a recent Australian alcohol campaign designed to increase students' awareness of excessive and harmful drinking. Six hundred and seventy one university students (51% females), who had seen the campaign posters, with the tagline "Is Getting Pissed Getting Pathetic? (Just Ask You Friends)", were asked to comment on the messages that the campaign was communicating and how informative, relevant, and effective they perceived the campaign. Many students were positive in their evaluations and described the messages as "truth and realistic", "clear and to the point", and that the campaign made them think about their own drinking. However, other views were more negative and indicative of psychological reactance. These included concerns that students "won't listen" or "don't care" about media campaigns, and that "they don't what to be told what to do". The findings highlight how media campaigns can help an audience contemplate behavioral change, however, they can also alienate students and promote counterproductive attitudes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To perform a comprehensive content analysis of substance use in contemporary popular music.; DESIGN: We analyzed the 279 most popular songs of 2005 according to Billboard magazine. Two coders working independently used a standardized data collection instrument to code portrayals of substance use.; OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence and explicit use of substances and motivations for, associations with, and consequences of substance use.; RESULTS: Of the 279 songs, 93 (33.3%) portrayed substance use, with an average of 35.2 substance references per song-hour. Portrayal of substance use varied significantly (P < .001) by genre, with 1 or more references in 3 of 35 pop songs (9%), 9 of 66 rock songs (14%), 11 of 55 R & B/hip-hop songs (20%), 22 of 61 country songs (36%), and 48 of 62 rap songs (77%). While only 2.9% of the 279 songs portrayed tobacco use, 23.7% depicted alcohol use, 13.6% depicted marijuana use, and 11.5% depicted other or unspecified substance use. In the 93 songs with substance use, it was most often motivated by peer/social pressure (45 [48%]) or sex (28 [30%]); use was commonly associated with partying (50 [54%]), sex (43 [46%]), violence (27 [29%]), and/or humor (22 [24%]). Only 4 songs (4%) contained explicit antiuse messages, and none portrayed substance refusal. Most songs with substance use (63 [68%]) portrayed more positive than negative consequences; these positive consequences were most commonly social, sexual, financial, or emotional.; CONCLUSIONS: The average adolescent is exposed to approximately 84 references to explicit substance use daily in popular songs, and this exposure varies widely by musical genre. The substance use depicted in popular music is frequently motivated by peer acceptance and sex, and it has highly positive associations and consequences.

AB BACKGROUND: Base-line data from a community-based HIV outreach effort serving Puerto Rican injection drug users (IDUs) in Massachusetts identified that approximately half of their clients were born on the mainland and half on the island.; METHODS: Logistic regression methods examined the relationship between place of birth, primary language spoken, primary residence of family and needle sharing for a sample of 200 Puerto Rican IDUs residing in Massachusetts. Focus groups were used to interpret quantitative findings.; RESULTS: A logistic regression model indicated that Puerto Rican IDUs born on mainland USA were 2.1 times more likely to share needles than IDUs born in Puerto Rico, after controlling for gender, age, education, drug overdose, incarceration history and psychiatric status. Also, Puerto Rican IDUs who were older had overdosed on drugs in the past year, had been incarcerated in their lifetime, and were homeless were significantly more likely to report having shared needles in the past 6 months compared to their counterparts. Focus group interviews with Puerto Rican outreach workers and individuals in recovery suggested that differences in needle sharing by mainland versus island born IDUs may be due to cultural differences in interpretation of the interview questions.; IMPLICATIONS: Researchers examining HIV risk behaviors among culturally diverse substance abusers need to conduct more mixed-method studies to identify if different cultural groups understand quantitative measures differently. Incarceration may be a significant risk factor in the continued spread of HIV among IDUs and expanded HIV prevention efforts need to be developed that specifically target this high-risk group.

AB Although genetic and environmental influences on behavior problems in middle childhood and adolescence have been well-studied, little is known about the etiology of behavior problems in very early childhood. The present study explores genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in behavior problems and competences in an infant-toddler sample of twins. There were 1,950 twin pairs (mean age=23.8 months) who were rated by parents on the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment. All four domains (Externalizing, Internalizing, Dysregulation, Competence) and 20 subscales-indices on the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment displayed significant heritability. There were also substantial shared environmental influences operating on most of the domains and subscales. Compared with behavior problems, behavioral competencies were less heritable and more influenced by shared environments. (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved

AB BACKGROUND: This study examined the relationships between watching wrestling on television (TV) and engaging in health risk behaviors among an older multi-state sample of adolescents.; METHODS: In 2001, a random sample of 2,307 youth ages 16 to 20 years from 138 communities in 17 US states completed telephone surveys as part of the national evaluation of the Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws Program. The survey measured multiple health risk behaviors, including substance use, involvement in date fighting, other violent behaviors, and sexual risk behaviors. The frequency of watching wrestling on TV during the two week period before the survey was measured with a scale of 0 to 14 or more times. Multivariate analyses were conducted with logistic regression using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with an exchangeable correlation structure that controlled for within-group clustering. Data are presented as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals.; RESULTS: Males (22.4%) reported watching wrestling more than females (13.6%). After adjusting for ethnicity, sex, median family income, age, region of the country, other fighting behaviors, and family composition, the frequency of watching wrestling was associated with having tried to hurt someone with a weapon (OR = 1.67, CI = 1.05-2.66), engaging in sexual intercourse without using birth control (1.42, 1.01-1.98), being a current cigarette smoker (1.31, 1.02-1.69), and not drinking (0.64, 0.48-0.85). When the frequency of watching wrestling was treated as an independent variable, after adjusting for covariates, each additional time wrestling was watched on TV was associated with an increased risk of being in a date fight (1.16, 1.02-1.30), threatening to hurt someone with a weapon (1.14, 1.02-1.28), hurting someone with a weapon (1.19, 105-1.34), and engaging in sexual intercourse without using birth control (1.13, 1.03-1.23). For example, youth who had watched wrestling six times during the past two weeks were 144% more likely to have engaged in a date fight than adolescents who had not watched wrestling.; CONCLUSIONS: The more frequently these adolescents reported watching wrestling on TV, the more likely they were to engage in violent and other health risk behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Skeletal age deviation (SAD) is associated with bone mass and fracture risk in children, but factors determining this are unknown. The aim of this population-based cross-sectional study was to describe the factors associated with SAD.; METHODS: A convenience sample of 640 male and female children aged 7-17 yr was studied. All were assessed for body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), diet, strength, dexterity, habitual physical activity, sunlight exposure, smoking, and medication use. Skeletal age was assigned using the Tanner-Whitehouse-2 method.; RESULTS: Subjects with a SAD greater than the 75th percentile had significantly higher height, weight, and Tanner stage compared with all other subjects. Bone-free lean mass, fat mass, and grip strength were positively associated with SAD. In multivariate analysis, ever smoking and use of inhaled corticosteroids were negatively associated with SAD, whereas milk drinking was positively associated with SAD. There was no significant association between sunlight exposure, television watching, light, or strenuous exercise and SAD.; CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study should be regarded as hypothesis generating but are biologically plausible and suggest that body composition, strength, diet, ever smoking, and inhaled corticosteroid use may be determinants of bone maturity relative to age and thus affect fracture risk in children. However, more studies are necessary to explore other determinants of SAD such as genetic and perinatal factors and whether SAD influences peak bone mass.

AB This study explored the relationship between adolescents' viewing of specific television genres (action movies, news and music videos) and the intention to take risks in traffic. Participants were 2194 adolescent boys and girls who completed a questionnaire on television viewing, risk perception and the intention to speed and drive after consuming alcohol. As hypothesized, more news viewing was associated with a higher perceived risk of drunk driving and speeding. More music video viewing, on the other hand, was negatively associated with the assessment of the dangers of speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. Girls regarded speeding and drunk driving as more dangerous than boys did. Contrary to our hypotheses, action movie viewing did not make a significant contribution to our models. Both news and music video viewing were indirectly, via risk perception, related to the intention to drive risky. The more dangerous a particular behavior was perceived to be, the less likely respondents intended to exhibit this behavior in the future.

AB In the US, African American injection drug users have increased risk for acquiring HIV and for not having long-term survival post AIDS diagnosis. This study examines the cognitive interpretations African American injection drug users make of an HIV-positive test result and the attitudinal and behavioural patterns that accompany those interpretations. Using snowball sampling techniques, street outreach was used to recruit 839 African American injection drug users and their partners for HIV testing and counselling. Subsequently, data were collected for 80 individuals who tested HIV-positive. Individuals who interpreted testing HIV-positive as a 'wake up call' displayed the attitudinal and behavioural patterns of 'being blessed', 'living clean' and 'advocacy'. Those that interpreted the test result as a 'death knell' displayed 'self-destructive', 'pleasure-seeking' and 'vengeance'. Those that interpreted the positive test result as 'just one more problem' displayed 'resignation' and 'minimization'. The period following the diagnosis of HIV provides an opportunity for intervention. A positive HIV status can produce lifestyle changes that either facilitate or militate against a person's health and quality of life. HIV-prevention efforts can be improved by helping individuals living with the virus to interpret and act on their diagnosis in positive ways.

AB Although the number of patients receiving antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in Central China is expanding, little is known about their medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to: (1) describe adherence prevalence among patients receiving free ARV in south central China; (2) identify factors associated with adherence; (3) compare 3 self-report measures of adherence in this population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at seven free treatment sites in Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces. Adherence measures included direct questioning regarding the number of doses taken in the 7 days prior to interview, the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) Adherence Self-Report questionnaire, and a 7-day visual analogue scale. Subjects comprised all patients returning for monthly ARV follow-up at each site between April and July 2006. Among the 308 subjects, 244 (79%) lived in the countryside. One hundred seventy (55%) had been on ARV over 1 year. No regimen included a protease inhibitor. Two hundred forty-four (80%) reported taking more than 90% of prescribed doses in the previous 7 days. Sixty-four (20%) subjects reported missing at least 1 dose in that period. The three measures of self-reported adherence were highly correlated. On multivariate analysis, current heroin use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1,6, p = 0.05) and nonuse of reminders such as cell phone alarms, wall charts, or TV programs (OR 6; 95% CI 3, 11; p = 0.001) were associated with 90% or less adherence. Adherence to ARV in Central China is similar to elsewhere in the world. The 20% of subjects who reported taking 90% or fewer doses are of concern in view of the potential for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance and lack of protease inhibitor back-up regimens. Substance abuse treatment will be an essential element of successful AIDS treatment in China. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of reminder devices to improve adherence in this population and to describe the prevalence and incidence of ARV resistance.

AB Adolescents with alcohol-related problems often also use cigarettes and marijuana. Furthermore, early childhood characteristics that increase the risk for adolescent alcohol use disorders also increase the risk for problematic drug use. Identifying these characteristics early in childhood can be important for the prevention of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders. As a result, researchers are seeking to identify liability factors and observable characteristics (i.e., phenotypes) that can predict substance use disorders (SUDs) across drug categories. Other studies are focusing on endophenotypes--characteristics that cannot be openly observed but which link a person's genetic makeup, or genotype, and disease. Both predictive behavioral phenotypes and endophenotypes may reveal pathways connecting heritable predispositions and early environmental influences to later SUDs. One suggested predictive phenotype is psychological dysregulation, which is characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and emotional difficulties in childhood. An endophenotype that has been studied extensively is a particular brain wave called the P300 event-related potential. For people who are at high risk of AOD use based on these characteristics, adverse environmental conditions frequently lead to SUDs. Given the strong evidence that childhood psychological dysregulation predicts problematic AOD use, effective interventions for preventing adolescent SUDs may need to target the environmental features that put adolescents with this behavioral constellation at increased risk.

AB BACKGROUND: An ongoing debate exists about whether the US should adopt a universal health insurance programme. Much of the debate has focused on programme implementation and cost, with relatively little attention to benefits for social welfare.; OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect on US population health outcomes, measured by mortality, of extending private health insurance to the uninsured, and to obtain a rough estimate of the aggregate economic benefits of extending insurance coverage to the uninsured.; METHOD: We use state-level panel data for all 50 states for the period 1990-2000 to estimate a health insurance augmented, aggregate health production function for the US. An instrumental variables fixed-effects estimator is used to account for confounding variables and reverse causation from health status to insurance coverage. Several observed factors, such as income, education, unemployment, cigarette and alcohol consumption and population demographic characteristics are included to control for potential confounding variables that vary across both states and time.; RESULTS: The results indicate a negative relationship between private insurance and mortality, thus suggesting that extending insurance to the uninsured population would result in an improvement in population health outcomes. The estimate of the marginal effect of insurance coverage indicates that a 10% increase in the population-insured rate of a state reduces mortality by 1.69-1.92%. Using data for the year 2003, we calculate that extending private insurance coverage to the entire uninsured population in the US would save over 75 000 lives annually and may yield annual net benefits to the nation in excess of $US400 billion.; CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that extending health insurance coverage through the private market to the 46 million Americans without health insurance may well produce large social economic benefits for the nation as a whole.

AB Few studies on treatment or prevention of obesity have shown significant results. Theoretically, in children and adolescents as compared to adults, prevention of excessive weight gain should be easy due to the energy expended during growth, associated with more time spent in leisure-time activities. However, numerous factors that stimulate overeating and sedentary behaviors are difficult to overcome. Additionally, most intervention studies have focused on a minor portion of the many factors associated with obesity. Important aspects of the obesity epidemic such as the role of the food industry, fast food chains, advertising, and a lifestyle that limits children to sedentary activities and overeating cannot be explored by a traditional clinical trial design. At any rate, among the published interventions, those including the family in weight-reduction strategies have shown the best results, as compared to children-centered approaches. Meanwhile, studies on specific nutrient or dietary composition (such as calcium, protein, or glycemic index) related to prevention or treatment of obesity have failed to yield good results. Reducing the intake of high-sugar carbonated drinks and juices has shown promising but still inconclusive results.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate racial and sex differences on the risk factors for smoking initiation and daily smoking among juvenile justice adolescents, a population that is traditionally ignored in school-based epidemiological samples. This study used archival data collected by juvenile justice authorities for a large sample of juvenile justice adolescents (N=4381), examining interaction terms to determine race and sex differences for risk factors. About 70% of juvenile justice adolescents reported ever having smoked cigarettes while almost half reported daily smoking. Overall predictors of ever and daily smoking included older age, being female, White, use of alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine in the past year, affiliation with smoking peers, not living with at least one parent, and a diagnosis of ADHD. While differences were seen between individual predictor models for both race and sex, the interaction terms did not add significantly to the overall model. These important racial and gender differences in this study suggest that tailored prevention messages and interventions may be needed to be most effective with adolescents in the juvenile justice system. While this study provides a basic foundation of risk factors for smoking among juvenile justice adolescents, future research is needed to assess the efficacy of treatment and prevention interventions with this high risk group of adolescent smokers.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at investigating the influence of food availability, rules and television viewing habits on eating behaviours in adolescents.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.; SETTING: Four randomly selected middle schools.; SUBJECTS: A sample of 534 seventh and eighth graders.; INTERVENTIONS: Validated questionnaires were used to measure the family environment and fat, soft drink and fruit consumption. Hierarchical regression analyses on fat, soft drink and fruit consumption, with demographic and psychosocial variables entered as the first and environmental factors as the second block were conducted in boys and girls.; RESULTS: Boys with more unhealthy products available at home consumed more fat (P< or =0.001, 95% CI: 8.2-29.4) and more soft drinks (P< or =0.01, 95% CI: 0.2-1.4). Boys who reported better television viewing habits ate more fruit (P< or =0.001, 95% CI: -1.7 to -0.5). Girls who reported better television viewing habits consumed less fat (P< or =0.01, 95% CI: 1.4-9.0) and more fruit (P< or =0.05, 95% CI: -1.0 to -0.1). Girls who reported higher availability of healthy products at home (P< or =0.05, 95% CI: 0.3-3.1) and more food rules (P< or =0.001, 95% CI: -1.8 to -0.5), consumed more fruit. Environmental factors were poor predictors of soft drink consumption among girls.; CONCLUSION: Availability of (un)healthy food products, family food rules and TV viewing habits were related to one or more eating behaviours in boys or girls. Although home environmental factors can play an important role in influencing adolescents' eating behaviours, these factors were generally less predictive than demographic and psychosocial variables.

AB This study aims to address the underlying trajectories of weekly individual drinking patterns by growth models and to relate differences in drinking patterns to socio-demographic and drinking characteristics of respondents. Data came from a two-stage stratified random subsample of 747 persons aged 15 years or more from a Swiss study on alcohol consumption using a within-subject design conducted between March 1999 and July 1999. Beverage specific assessment of daily alcohol consumption was obtained by a weekly drinking diary and other characteristics via telephone interviews. The diary had to be filled out on seven consecutive days. The growth models accounted for up to 37.6% of the initial error variance and provided evidence for two distinct, negatively correlated underlying trajectories of drinking patterns. The first trajectory described an increase in consumption from Monday to Sunday. The second trajectory was about a specific weekend consumption culminating on Saturday with a significantly higher growth rate among young people and heavy episodic drinkers than in other subgroups. Therefore, young and heavy episodic drinkers may be exposed to sudden adverse consequences of alcohol consumption during the weekend. Prevention efforts which are targeted to this subgroup should take its specific drinking pattern into account. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The 12-week intervention was conducted with 122 students at a rural elementary school in Kentucky. Significant findings from the intervention were the increase in expectations for drinking water (p=0.049), increase in expectations for watching television (p=0.002), and increase in the number of glasses of water consumed (p=0.022) from pre-test to post-test. Recommendations have been offered for future obesity reduction programs that can be implemented in the elementary schools.

AB Commonly suggested public health strategies to combat adolescent obesity are encouraging daily physical activity, limiting television viewing, replacing sweetened beverage consumption with water, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. This study examined the extent to which selected social cognitive theory constructs can predict these four behaviors among preadolescents in India. A 55-item valid and reliable scale was administered to 324 fifth graders. The significant predictor of physical activity was number of times taught at school (p < or = 0.008). None of the Social Cognitive theory variables were found to be significant predictors for numbers of hours of watching TV or drinking water instead of sweetened beverages. In the case of fruit and vegetable consumption, the significant predictor was self-efficacy to eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables (p < 0.0001). The study discusses ways Social Cognitive theory can be bolstered to influence adolescent obesity behaviors in India.

AB OBJECTIVE: Advertising influences the health-related behaviors of college-aged individuals. Cigarette manufacturers aggressively market to young adults and may exploit their affinity for alcohol when creating advertisements designed to increase cigarettes' appeal. Internal tobacco industry documents reveal that cigarette manufacturers understood the popularity of alcohol among young adults and sought to produce pertinent marketing strategies.; METHODS: The authors conducted a content analysis of cigarette and alcohol advertisements in young adult-oriented magazines to investigate portrayed associations between cigarettes and alcohol.; RESULTS: The content analysis revealed that 32 of 114 cigarette advertisements referenced alcohol and that those advertisements were more likely than others to portray active smoking. Conversely, 0 of 317 alcohol advertisements referenced cigarettes, and alcohol advertisements were only slightly more likely than cigarette advertisements to feature alcohol-related settings.; CONCLUSIONS: Such advertising may detrimentally affect smoking patterns of college students. An understanding of these strategies can benefit on-campus tobacco control efforts.

AB Evaluation research pertaining to the development of assessment instruments that fully capture the facets of empowerment prevention perspectives among youth are sparse. With funding from the American Legacy Foundation, the University of New Mexico Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, in partnership with the New Mexico State Department of Health, developed a measure of individual empowerment. Drawing from the various bodies of literature in adolescent development, substance abuse prevention, and program/coalition building, a questionnaire was developed to capture facets of individual empowerment as it pertains to tobacco prevention efforts among youth within New Mexico. Utilizing a sample of 112 youth participants, principal axis factor analysis with Varimax rotation revealed four valid sub-scales entitled active participation, empowerment efficacy, external organizational involvement, and participant satisfaction. Internal consistency reliabilities were satisfactory with Cronbach's alpha ranging from .78 to .84. Regression mediation analysis revealed that active participation mediated the relationship of empowerment efficacy and self-esteem. Challenges associated with conceptualizing and assessing empowerment among youth are discussed.

AB Behavioral genetic studies imply that salient environmental influences operate within families, making siblings in a family different rather than similar. This study is the first one to examine differential sibling experiences (as measured with the Sibling Inventory of Differential Experience) and its effect on behavioral outcomes within ADHD families. Subjects were 45 Dutch ADHD probands and their unaffected siblings (n = 45) aged 10-18 years. ADHD probands and their unaffected siblings reported differences in sibling interaction, parental treatment, and peer characteristics. These nonshared environmental influences were related to both the severity of ADHD symptoms as well as to comorbid problem behaviors. These findings suggest that environmental influences that operate within ADHD families appear relevant to the severity of problem behaviors of ADHD children and their siblings.

This study evaluated the short-and long-term efficacy of the You Hold the Key (YHTK) Teen Driving Countermeasure.; METHOD: A two-page survey was completed by high school students at pretest, posttest, and long-term (6-month) posttest.; RESULTS: YHTK was associated with significant immediate and long-term improvements in teen seatbelt use, safe driving, and perceived confidence in preventing drunk driving. Compared to pretests, students at immediate and long-term posttest more frequently wore seatbelts when driving or riding, required passengers to wear seatbelts, and limited the number of passengers to the number of seatbelts in the vehicle. Students were more likely at both posttests to avoid drinking and driving and to say no to riding with a friend who had been drinking.; SUMMARY: YHTK was associated with increases in safe teen driving and passenger behaviors.; IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Success of YHTK is most notably due to its comprehensive nature. Future programs should consider comprehensive strategies when attempting to modify teen behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: The current study assessed women's risk for victimization during the first year at college, based on changes in drinking during the transition from high school to college. We were specifically interested in differential risk for victimization based on women's change in drinking status over the transition to college. We compared continued abstainers with women who began drinking ("new" drinkers) and women who continued drinking but either decreased, increased, or did not change their level of weekly drinking.; METHOD: Data were collected using a Web-based survey each fall for the first 2 years at college with one cohort (N = 886) of incoming freshmen women at a large state university in New York. Women reported on their alcohol and other drug use, psychological symptoms, number of sexual partners, and experiences with physical and sexual victimization for the year before entering college (Year 1 survey) and for the first year at college (Year 2 survey).; RESULTS: Abstainers were significantly less likely to experience physical or sexual victimization during the first year at college, compared with drinkers. Logistic regression indicated that there were differences in the predictors of physical and sexual victimization during the first year at college. These differences included history of victimization, psychological symptoms, and number of sexual partners, as well as the type of change in drinking over the transition.; CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with abstainers, having a history of physical victimization, greater psychological symptoms, and being a "new" drinker increased the odds of physical victimization, whereas having a greater number of current psychological symptoms, sexual partners, and increasing weekly drinking increased the odds of sexual victimization during the first year at college. These findings have implications for prevention efforts targeting young women entering college.

AB Secondary syringe exchange (SSE) refers to the exchange of sterile syringes between injection drug users (IDUs). To date there has been limited examination of SSE in relation to the social networks of IDUs. This study aimed to identify characteristics of drug injecting networks associated with the receipt of syringes through SSE. Active IDUs were recruited from syringe exchange and methadone treatment programs in Montreal, Canada, between April 2004 and January 2005. Information on each participant and on their drug-injecting networks was elicited using a structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Subjects' network characteristics were examined in relation to SSE using regression models with generalized estimating equations. Of 218 participants, 126 were SSE recipients with 186 IDUs in their injecting networks. The 92 non-recipients reported 188 network IDUs. Networks of SSE recipients and non-recipients were similar with regard to network size and demographics of network members. In multivariate analyses adjusted for age and gender, SSE recipients were more likely than non-recipients to self-report being HIV-positive (OR=3.56 [1.54-8.23]); require or provide help with injecting (OR=3.74 [2.01-6.95]); have a social network member who is a sexual partner (OR=1.90 [1.11-3.24]), who currently attends a syringe exchange or methadone program (OR=2.33 [1.16-4.70]), injects daily (OR=1.77 [1.11-2.84]), and shares syringes with the subject (OR=2.24 [1.13-4.46]). SSE is associated with several injection-related risk factors that could be used to help focus public health interventions for risk reduction. Since SSE offers an opportunity for the dissemination of important prevention messages, SSE-based networks should be used to improve public health interventions. This approach can optimize the benefits of SSE while minimizing the potential risks associated with the practice of secondary exchange.

A central premise of this chapter and the rest of the volume is that promoting mastery of social and emotional core competencies provides a connection between positive youth development and risk prevention programming. In subsequent chapters, empirical evidence linking these core competencies with prevention of specific risk behaviors is reviewed, and examples of integrated promotion and prevention efforts in the United States and internationally are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess any clustering between obesity, number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT), television (TV) viewing, and lifestyle factors among pre-adolescents living in 2 countries with different developmental status and oral health care systems - Turkey and Finland.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of Finnish (n = 338) and Turkish (n = 611) preadolescents, 10-12 years old, was undertaken with preadolescent oral health data and health behavior questionnaires for pre-adolescents and their mothers. The parameters examined were DMFT, body mass index (BMI), leisure time activities (TV viewing), and lifestyle factors (family dinners and dietary habits) of pre-adolescents. Data analysis included factor analysis, Student's t-test, and Chi-square tests by cross tabulation.; RESULTS: Turkish pre-adolescents were more obese and had poorer dental health than their Finnish counterparts (p < 0.05). Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents drinking fizzy drinks more than 3 times a week were more likely to watch TV for >or= 2 h/school day (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-2.28) than those consuming them once a week or less (OR = 3.06, 95% CI 1.39-6.75; p < 0.05). Factor analysis revealed that DMFT and obesity shared the same cluster among Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents.; CONCLUSION: Both medical and dental examination of any pediatric patient should include BMI, leisure time activities, and dietary habits as well as socio-economic status.

AB BACKGROUND: Although many individual health behaviours (e.g. diet/activity) have been implicated in the current rise in obesity levels, their confounding or cumulative effects have yet to be established. This study psychometrically tested a previously piloted comprehensive measure of obesity risk factors, designed to assess their relative importance at individual and population levels.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: A user-friendly, self-report questionnaire, completed by 359 adult volunteers (71% female, age range 18-81 years), was subjected to exploratory factor analysis and related to body mass index (BMI) and age.; RESULTS: The final solution had 74 items and showed a clear factor structure, with 5 dietary and 5 activity factors, plus 8 unrelated factors covering dieting behaviour, alcohol consumption, sleep, and varied developmental influences. Younger respondents generally reported unhealthier behaviours. Once age was controlled for, less healthy eating, more emotional eating, higher amounts eaten, less physical activity, more use of mechanised transport, and more/less successful dieting behaviour were all strongly related to higher BMI, with lesser associations for more TV watching and less parental encouragement to be active.; CONCLUSION: This easy-touse self-report measure of multiple risk factors showed good psychometric properties and has merit in determining the contribution of varied factors in the tendency to overweight and obesity. The finding that younger adults generally reported less healthy dietary and activity behaviour indicates a pressing need for early intervention.

AB OBJECTIVES: With alcohol-related problems remaining a concern on college campuses, prevention efforts are increasingly directed to addressing the environmental factors that encourage consumption. This study examined students' support for alcohol control policies, correlates of that support, and actual vs. perceived peer support.; METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of 510 college students. We conducted a three-step hierarchical regression analysis to examine predictors of policy support. Levels of personal and perceived peer support for alcohol control policies were compared.; RESULTS: Findings revealed a high level of policy support among students, with variability in support by gender, alcohol consumption levels, and drinking and driving tendencies. Additionally, compared to the percentage of students who supported each policy, a smaller percentage thought other students were supportive.; CONCLUSIONS: Results provide valuable insights to inform the development of media campaigns and other environmental management initiatives.

AB Liliana Escobar-Chaves and Craig Anderson investigate two important trends among American youth and examine the extent to which the two trends might be related. First, the authors note that U.S. youth are spending increasing amounts of time using electronic media, with the average American youngster now spending one-third of each day with some form of electronic media. Second, the authors demonstrate that American adolescents are engaging in a number of unhealthful behaviors that impose huge societal costs. Escobar-Chaves and Anderson detail the extent of five critical types of adolescent health risk behaviors identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-obesity, smoking, drinking, sexual risk taking, and violence. Obesity, the authors note, has become an epidemic among America's young people. Cigarette smoking among adolescents is one of the ten leading health indicators of greatest government concern. Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are widespread problems among the nation's youth and are the source of the three leading causes of death among youth. More than 20 percent of American high school students have sexual intercourse for the first time before they reach the age of fourteen. And twelve- to twenty-year-olds perpetrated 28 percent of the single-offender and 41 percent of multiple-offender violent crimes in the United States in 2005. Escobar-Chaves and Anderson present and evaluate research findings on the influence of electronic media on these five risk behaviors among adolescents. Researchers, they say, have found modest evidence that media consumption contributes to the problem of obesity, modest to strong evidence that it contributes to drinking and smoking, and strong evidence that it contributes to violence. Research has been insufficient to find links between heavy media exposure and early sexual initiation. The authors note the need for more large-scale longitudinal studies that specifically examine the cumulative effects of electronic media on risky health behavior.

AB PURPOSE: This longitudinal study examined the influence of alcohol advertising and promotions on the initiation of alcohol use. A measure of receptivity to alcohol marketing was developed from research about tobacco marketing. Recall and recognition of alcohol brand names were also examined.; METHODS: Data were obtained from in-class surveys of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Participants who were classified as never drinkers at baseline (n = 1,080) comprised the analysis sample. Logistic regression models examined the association of advertising receptivity at baseline with any alcohol use and current drinking at follow-up, adjusting for multiple risk factors, including peer alcohol use, school performance, risk taking, and demographics.; RESULTS: At baseline, 29% of never drinkers either owned or wanted to use an alcohol branded promotional item (high receptivity), 12% students named the brand of their favorite alcohol ad (moderate receptivity), and 59% were not receptive to alcohol marketing. Approximately 29% of adolescents reported any alcohol use at follow-up; 13% reported drinking at least 1 or 2 days in the past month. Never drinkers who reported high receptivity to alcohol marketing at baseline were 77% more likely to initiate drinking by follow-up than those were not receptive. Smaller increases in the odds of alcohol use at follow-up were associated with better recall and recognition of alcohol brand names at baseline.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol advertising and promotions are associated with the uptake of drinking. Prevention programs may reduce adolescents' receptivity to alcohol marketing by limiting their exposure to alcohol ads and promotions and by increasing their skepticism about the sponsors' marketing tactics.

AB CONTEXT: Appalachia has high rates of tobacco use and related health problems, and despite significant impediments to alcohol use, alcohol abuse is common. Adolescents are exposed to sophisticated tobacco and alcohol advertising. Prevention messages, therefore, should reflect research concerning culturally influenced attitudes toward tobacco and alcohol use.; METHODS: With 4 grants from the National Institutes of Health, 34 focus groups occurred between 1999 and 2003 in 17 rural Appalachian jurisdictions in 7 states. These jurisdictions ranged between 4 and 8 on the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes of the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture. Of the focus groups, 25 sought the perspectives of women in Appalachia, and 9, opinions of adolescents.; FINDINGS: The family represented the key context where residents of Appalachia learn about tobacco and alcohol use. Experimentation with tobacco and alcohol frequently commenced by early adolescence and initially occurred in the context of the family home. Reasons to abstain from tobacco and alcohol included a variety of reasons related to family circumstances. Adults generally displayed a greater degree of tolerance for adolescent alcohol use than tobacco use. Tobacco growing represents an economic mainstay in many communities, a fact that contributes to the acceptance of its use, and many coal miners use smokeless tobacco since they cannot light up in the mines. The production and distribution of homemade alcohol was not a significant issue in alcohol use in the mountains even though it appeared not to have entirely disappeared.; CONCLUSIONS: Though cultural factors support tobacco and alcohol use in Appalachia, risk awareness is common. Messages tailored to cultural themes may decrease prevalence.

AB AIMS: The present study examined the associations between early onset of non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) (i.e. sedatives, tranquilizers, opioids, stimulants) and the development of prescription drug abuse and dependence in the United States.; DESIGN: Data were collected from structured diagnostic interviews using the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV).; SETTING: National prevalence estimates were derived from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, n = 43,093).; PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative cross-sectional sample of civilian non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years or older in the United States, of whom 52% were women, 71% white, 12% Hispanic, 11% African American, 4% Asian and 2% Native American or of other racial background.; FINDINGS: A higher percentage of individuals who began using prescription drugs non-medically at or before 13 years of age were found to have developed prescription drug abuse and dependence versus those individuals who began using at or after 21 years of age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that the odds of developing any life-time prescription drug abuse among non-medical users was reduced by approximately 5% with each year non-medical use was delayed [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94, 0.97], and that the odds of developing any life-time prescription drug dependence were reduced by about 2% with each year onset was delayed (AOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96, 1.00) when controlling for relevant covariates.; CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that early onset of NMUPD was a significant predictor of prescription drug abuse and dependence. These findings reinforce the importance of developing prevention efforts to reduce NMUPD and diversion of prescription drugs among children and adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a needle social marketing strategy to reduce needle sharing and hepatitis C Virus (HCV)/HIV transmission among injecting drug users (IDU) in China.; DESIGN: Two-armed, prospective, community-randomized prevention trial.; SETTING: Four counties/townships in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces; one randomized to intervention the other to control in each province.; PARTICIPANTS: Injecting drug users: 823 (443 intervention, 382 control) at baseline and 852 (415 intervention, 407 control) at the second cross-sectional survey 12 months later.; INTERVENTION: A needle social marketing programme, including promotion of safe injection norms and increased access to clean needles over a 12 month period.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cross sectional surveys at baseline and follow-up compared changes in drug using behaviours and HIV and HCV rates in the intervention and control communities.; RESULTS: Needle sharing behaviours were similar in the two groups at baseline (68.4 vs. 67.8%), and dropped significantly to 35.3% in the intervention community and remained relatively stable in the control community (62.3%; P < 0.001). In a subset of cohort of new injectors, the incidence of HCV was significant lower in intervention than in control in both provinces (P < 0.001, P = 0.014) and overall (P < 0.001) but HIV was only significantly lower in intervention in Guangdong (P = 0.011).; CONCLUSION: Needle social marketing can reduce risky injecting behaviour and HIV/HCV transmission among injecting drug users in China and should be expanded.

AB BACKGROUND: Heavy drinking is associated with an increased number of sexual partners. This study examined the extent to which alcohol dependence and conduct disorder are associated with the number of sexual partners and membership in a risk group of having a high number of sexual partners (10 or more).; METHODS: Data were obtained by personal interview from 601 relatives (aged 18 to 25 years) of alcohol-dependent probands who participated in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) project. Analyses examined the independent contribution of problem drinking (defined as having at least one symptom of DSM-IV alcohol dependence) and alcohol dependence, some conduct problems (defined as having at least one symptom of DSM-IV conduct disorder), conduct disorder, family status (defined as whether participant lived with both biological parents during childhood), educational attainment, gender, race, age at first intercourse, and age at time of interview to the number of sexual partners and to having 10 or more sexual partners.; RESULTS: After controlling for other variables, alcohol dependence, problem drinking, race, age at first intercourse, and age at time of interview were significantly associated with number of sexual partners. The risk for having 10 or more sexual partners rose substantially for those who were alcohol dependent (OR = 2.5, 1.3-4.5, p = 0.004) and those with conduct disorder (OR = 1.8, 1.0-3.3, p = 0.041) after controlling for other variables. There is also a trend toward problem drinking and some conduct problems being associated with the risk of having 10 or more sexual partners though this did not reach statistical significance.; CONCLUSIONS: These analyses demonstrate that alcohol-dependent individuals and those with conduct disorder are at risk for increased number of sexual partners (10 or more). Sexually transmitted disease prevention efforts should target individuals with these two conditions to help decrease high risk sexual behaviors.

AB This study examines relationships between country of origin, age of drinking onset, and adverse drinking outcomes among young adult Mexican Americans in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Logistic regression models estimate associations between age of drinking onset, age of onset in relation to age at immigration, and adverse drinking outcomes, controlling for sex, age, employment, education, marital status, and income. Adjusted analyses indicate the odds of adverse drinking outcomes decreased as age of drinking onset increased. Mexican Americans who initiated drinking in Mexico had significantly lower odds of current or lifetime harmful drinking than U.S. born but the odds were not significantly different between foreign-born Mexican Americans who initiated drinking in the U.S. and U.S. born. Irrespective of whether drinking onset was in Mexico or the U.S., foreign-born Mexican Americans had lower odds of alcohol abuse than U.S. born. However, odds of dependence were not significantly different between foreign-born and U.S.-born Mexican Americans. While findings suggest that being foreign born may be protective, further research on social and cultural factors impacting drinking onset and related outcomes among young Mexican Americans may help inform prevention efforts.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate bullying behaviours and their associations with health and health risk behaviours. This study involved completion of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) and Youth Self Report (YSR) questionnaires by 3,519 students. Of the students, 59.4% (n=2,091) were neither bullies/nor victims, 22% (n=774) victims, 9.4% (n=331) bully/victims and 9.2% (n=323) bullies. Generally, students involved in bullying behaviours were more likely to have higher YSR scale scores than students who were not involved in bullying behaviours. Bully/victims had higher scores on the YSR subscales than others. Students involved in bullying behaviours were more likely not to use seat belts, to watch TV >or= 4 h/day, to be involved in a physical fight, to skip class and to spend time with friends than students who were not involved in bullying behaviours. Bully/victims and bullies were more likely to smoke cigarettes, to drink alcohol, to be drunk, to play computer games and to be sexually active than others. Bully/victims were more likely to have less educated mothers and to have difficulty in talking to both parents than others. Victims were more likely to have a lower socioeconomic status, to have difficulty in talking to opposite gender friends and to have difficulty in making new friends than others. Bullying behaviour is common and associated with other risk behaviours and psychological health problems in Istanbul high school students. Health professionals should be aware of the influence of bullying on health and particularly on bully/victims' health. There is a strong need for bullying prevention programmes in schools in Turkey.

AB This article is a content analysis of 150 unique cases of children killing parents in the United States as reported in the electronic news media. The accuracy of online coverage of U.S. parricide incidents is assessed using two types of resources: officially reported national statistics on known parricidal incidents and the psychological and psychiatric literature on matricide and patricide. Comparisons of news accounts of media-reported U.S. parricide cases with Supplementary Homicide Report data indicate that electronic media coverage of parricide cases focused on the more sensational and unusual parricides. Analyses of these media accounts by offender age found 13 significant differences between juvenile and adult offenders. Ten of these 13 differences related to motive and Heide's parricide offender types (severely abused, severely mentally ill, and dangerously antisocial) and were consistent with the mental health-related literature in this area. The limitations and directions for future research are discussed at length.

AB Because young adult drinking occurs primarily in peer groups, this should be taken into account when studying influences on drinking behaviour. This paper aimed to assess influences on drinking by observing existing peer groups in a naturalistic setting. We first analysed the basic levels at which two types of influence take place. The first, modelling (imitating others' drinking), was found to significantly influence individual drinking, whereas for the second one, persuasion (drinking resulting from others offering drinks), no predictions were found. Subsequently, we examined whether peer group members' sociometric status in the group affected the amount of influence and persuasion exerted and received. No indications were found that sociometric status had an impact on influence in alcohol consumption within a drinking situation. Features and weaknesses of the study are discussed.

AB AIMS: To study the prevalence of disordered eating attitudes and behaviours among adolescents in Hong Kong and to examine the socio-demographic and behavioural correlates.; METHODS: Three secondary schools with different academic performance were selected from the Eastern District of Hong Kong. A total of 2382 students enrolled in Forms 1-7 at the three schools completed a specially designed questionnaire. The questionnaire contained questions on socio-demographic information, body weight satisfaction, exposure to mass media, health behaviours as well as the Eating Attitudes Test - 26 (EAT-26). Data were analysed using Student's t-test, chi2 analysis and multivariate logistic regression models.; RESULTS: Disordered eating (EAT score > or =20) was present in 52 (3.9%) adolescent boys and 68 (6.5%) adolescent girls. The youngest case was only 11 years old. A high degree of body weight dissatisfaction was shared by our adolescents. Teenage girls, overweight youths and those with poor academic performance were at increased risk of having disordered eating. Strong associations were found between disordered eating and other health-compromising behaviours including smoking, alcohol and soft drug use, delinquent behaviours, suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviours. Exposure to entertainment, beauty and youth magazines was positively related to disordered eating.; CONCLUSIONS: Disordered eating is prevalent among adolescents in Hong Kong. It remains a significant public health challenge to our community. Prevention programmes targeting youths at the greatest risk should be considered.

AB The present study used perspectives from the general literature on college alcohol consumption to examine mediational influences of peer, environmental, and parental variables on heavy drinking for student athlete and nonathlete samples. Eight hundred thirty-five freshmen who differed in organized sports involvement were compared on heavy drinking outcomes, peer norms, environmental influences, and parental communication. College athletes reported significantly more heavy drinking experiences than nonathletes. Peer norms, environmental influences, and parental communication were all significant mediators of the athlete-heavy drinking relationship. Athletes reported a higher perception of peer drinking, peer approval of drinking, higher alcohol availability, and direct drink offers, which, in turn, were related to higher rates of heavy drinking. Parental communication mediated the athlete-heavy drinking relationship differently, depending on the specific topic of conversation. Discussion surrounding the importance of incorporating a variety of interventions aimed at reducing collegiate athlete drinking on the basis of the peer, environmental, and parental influences observed in the present analyses are presented. Limitations and directions for future research are also noted.

AB Ready-to-drinks (RTDs) are composed of an alcoholic component and a soft-drink base and are primarily consumed by a youth market. The authors explored whether liking and experience with an RTD soft-drink base predicts liking for the RTD. Participants (N=350) from ages 12 to 30 years sampled 3 RTDs and their respective soft-drink and alcoholic components. For milk- and fruit-based RTDs, liking for and familiarity with their soft-drink base was the best predictor of liking for and familiarity with the RTD itself. For the Coke-based RTD, familiarity with and liking for bourbon best predicted familiarity with and liking for the RTD. All of these effects were consistent across blind and nonblind testing. The authors' results suggest that where there is perceptual similarity between the RTD and its soft-drink base, these beverages may provide an easy transition into alcohol consumption for novice drinkers.

AB BACKGROUND: Little is known about the labor market outcomes of people who have attempted suicide or thought about suicide.; METHODS: We used micro-level data from the first wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions 2001-2002 to examine the effects of suicidal behavior on income and employment. The data provide a representative sample of the U.S. population, with its primary purpose to provide information on alcohol use disorders for the civilian non-institutionalized population aged 18 and over. The data include employment, income, and other socioeconomic and demographic information on respondents. Since the survey included 43,093 people, the data include a large number of respondents who attempted suicide or thought about committing suicide. We estimated earnings regressions and logit and ordered logit employment regressions. We used methods of IV estimation as well as two stage linear probability models to address potential endogeneity of suicidal behavior while estimating regressions separately by sex, since there are significant differences in suicide rates, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation between men and women.; RESULTS: We find that suicide attempts and suicidal ideation are negatively related to personal income and the probability of employment. The effects differ by sex. Men and women who attempted suicide had mean earnings lower by 16 and 13 percent, respectively. This amount reflects the combined effect of suicidal behavior and mental illness. With instrumental variable regression, the magnitude of the effects becomes larger-for example, as much as 50 percent decrease in the income of males who attempted suicide. Thoughts of suicide negatively affect income but to a smaller extent. Logit and ordered logit regressions indicate that attempted suicide reduces the probability of fulltime employment by over 20 percentage points for men and approximately 17 percentage points for women.; IMPLICATIONS: People who engaged in suicidal behavior reported significantly lower employment and earnings. Although data were insufficient to directly address the issue, it appears the effect may persist over a long period of time. This is particularly troubling since health insurance is closely tied to employment and without health insurance, treatment options may be limited.

AB BACKGROUND: The role of homosexuality and anal sex practices in the African HIV -1 epidemic is not well described. We aimed to assess the risk factors for prevalent HIV-1 infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) to guide HIV-1 prevention efforts.; METHODS: Socio-behavioural characteristics, signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and serological evidence of HIV-1 were determined for 285 MSM at enrolment into a vaccine preparedness cohort study. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess risk factors for prevalent HIV-1 infection.; RESULTS: HIV-1 prevalence was 43.0% [49/114, 95% confidence interval (CI), 34-52%] for men who reported sex with men exclusively (MSME), and 12.3% (21/171, 95% CI, 7-17%) for men who reported sex with both men and women (MSMW). Eighty-six (75%) MSME and 69 (40%) MSMW reported recent receptive anal sex. Among 174 MSM sexually active in the last week, 44% reported no use of condoms with casual partners. In the previous 3 months, 210 MSM (74%) reported payment for sex, and most clients (93%) were local residents. Prevalent HIV-1 infection was associated with recent receptive anal sex [odds ratio (OR), 6.1; 95% CI, 2.4-16], exclusive sex with men (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.3-17), and increasing age (OR, 1.1 per year; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12). Only four MSM reported injecting drug use.; CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of HIV-1 in Kenyan MSM is probably attributable to unprotected receptive anal sex. There is an urgent need for HIV-1 prevention programmes to deliver targeted risk-reduction interventions and STD services to MSM in Kenya.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous research has indicated that children's behaviors have long-term effects on later life. Hence it is important to monitor the development of health risk behaviors in childhood. This study examined the changes in health risk behaviors in fourth- to sixth-grade students in northern Taiwan from 2001 to 2003.; METHODS: The Child and Adolescent Behaviors in Long-Term Evolution (CABLE) study collected data from 1,820 students from 2001 to 2003 (students were 9 or 10 years old in 2001). Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the aggregation of health risk behaviors. A linear growth curve model was used to determine whether health risk behaviors changed over time.; RESULTS: Of the 13 behaviors, staying up late and eating snacks late at night were the most prevalent (82.3% of subjects in 2001, 81.8% in 2002, 88.5% in 2003) and second most prevalent (68.7%, 67.4%, 71.6%) behaviors, respectively, from 2001 to 2003. The three least prevalent health risk behaviors were chewing betel nut (1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2%), smoking (1.4%, 1.0%, 0.8%), and drinking alcohol (8.5%, 6.0%, 5.2%). The frequencies of swearing and staying up late showed the greatest significant increases with time. On the other hand, suppressing urination and drinking alcohol decreased over time. Using exploratory factor analysis, we aggregated the health risk behaviors into three categories: unhealthy habits, aggressive behaviors, and substance use. Although students did not display high levels of aggressive behavior or experimentation with substances, the development of these behaviors in a small proportion of students should not be ignored. The results of the linear growth curve model indicated that unhealthy habits and aggressive behaviors increased over time. However, substance use slightly decreased over time.; CONCLUSION: We found that some health risk behaviors increased with time while others did not. Unhealthy habits and aggressive behaviors increased, whereas substance use slightly decreased during this period. Educational professionals should pay attention to the different patterns of change in these behaviors in elementary school students.

AB BACKGROUND: Concern has been expressed regarding the influence of the newer premixed alcohols, known as ready-to-drinks (RTDs), on adolescent alcohol use as a result of their sweet and milky flavours. Use of these flavours may reduce the natural barrier of the often strong and unpleasant flavour of alcohol to early experimentation and regular and heavy use.; AIM: To determine the acceptability and alcohol detectability of a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to young adolescents and young adults.; DESIGN: A convenience sample of 350 participants was recruited, 70 in each of five age groups. Participants were grouped according to age into 12-13 years, 14-15 years, 16-17 years, younger adults of 18-23 years and older adults of 24-30 years, with even gender distribution in an experimental design comparing blind and labelled acceptability testing of a range of RTDs and their alcohol and soft drink components, beer, wine and a novel beverage.; FINDINGS: The acceptability of alcohol increased with age; however, chocolate 'Mudshake', and to a lesser extent watermelon 'Breezer', had acceptability scores more like their soft drink base than their alcohol component. There were no significant differences in the ability to detect the presence of alcohol in the RTDs across age or beverage types.; CONCLUSION: Public policy makers and others concerned with preventing early initiation to alcohol use and binge drinking among adolescents should be aware that when using milk as a base for an RTD, particularly with an alcoholic base such as vodka, the drink may have high acceptance with young adolescents and equal palatability to milk, even though the presence of alcohol is not completely masked. Further research with a wider range of RTDs is required.

AB PURPOSE: To estimate medical and indirect costs to the Department of Defense (DoD) that are associated with tobacco use, being overweight or obese, and high alcohol consumption.; DESIGN: Retrospective, quantitative research.; SETTING: Healthcare provided in military treatment facilities and by providers participating in the military health system.; SUBJECTS: The 4.3 million beneficiaries under age 65 years who were enrolled in the military TRICARE Prime health plan option in 2006.; MEASURES: The findings come from a cost-of-disease model developed by combining information from DoD and civilian health surveys and studies; DoD healthcare encounter data for 4.1 million beneficiaries; and epidemiology literature on the increased risk of comorbidities from unhealthy behaviors.; RESULTS: DoD spends an estimated $2.1 billion per year for medical care associated with tobacco use ($564 million), excess weight and obesity ($1.1 billion), and high alcohol consumption ($425 million). DoD incurs nonmedical costs related to tobacco use, excess weight and obesity, and high alcohol consumption in excess of $965 million per year.; CONCLUSION: Unhealthy lifestyles are significant contributors to the cost of providing healthcare services to the nation's military personnel, military retirees, and their dependents. The continued rise in healthcare costs could impact other DoD programs and could potentially affect areas related to military capability and readiness. In 2006, DoD initiated Healthy Choices for Life initiatives to address the high cost of unhealthy lifestyles and behaviors, and the DoD continues to monitor lifestyle trends through the DoD Lifestyle Assessment Program.

AB CONTEXT: Obesity is a major public health problem in North America, particularly in Aboriginal people.; OBJECTIVE: To determine if a household-based lifestyle intervention is effective at reducing energy intake and increasing physical activity among Aboriginal families after 6 months.; DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION: Randomized, open trial of 57 Aboriginal households recruited between May 2004 and April 2005 from the Six Nations Reserve in Ohsweken, Canada. Aboriginal Health Counsellors made regular home visits to assist families in setting dietary and physical activity goals. Additional interventions included provision of filtered water, a physical activity program for children, and educational events about healthy lifestyles.; RESULTS: 57 households involving 174 individuals were randomized to intervention or usual care. Intervention households decreased consumption of fats, oils and sweets compared to usual care households (-4.9 servings per day vs. -3 servings/day, p=0.006), and this was associated with a reduction in trans fatty acids (-0.2 vs. +0.6 grams/day, p=0.02). Water consumption increased (+0.3 vs. -0.1 servings/day, p<0.04) and soda pop consumption decreased (-0.3 vs. -0.1 servings/day, p=0.02) in intervention households compared to usual care. A trend toward increased knowledge about healthy dietary practices in children, increased leisure-time activity and decreased sedentary behaviours was observed, although these differences were not statistically significant.; CONCLUSION: A household-based intervention is associated with some positive changes in dietary practices and activity patterns. A larger and longer-term intervention which addresses both individual change and structural barriers in the community is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine dietary supplementation practices and opinions, preferred means for dietary supplement (DS) education, and antidoping opinions among elite Canadian athletes varying in age and gender.; DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: Elite athlete training centers in Calgary, Canada and surrounding area.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 582 high-performance athletes (314 male, 268 female).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: High-performance athletes representing 27 sports with a mean age of 19.96+/-3.91 years completed a validated questionnaire assessing DS practices and opinions by recall. Sport categories included varsity, Canadian Sport Centre Calgary (CSCC), and National Sport School (NSS).; RESULTS: There was extensive DS use, with 88.4% of participants taking>or=1 DS (mean of 3.08+/-1.87 DS per user) during the previous 6 months. Overall, sport drinks (22.4%), sport bars (14.0%), multivitamins and minerals (13.5%), protein supplements (9.0%), and vitamin C (6.4%) were most frequently reported. Older athletes were significantly more likely to report greater DS usage; to be advised by teammates, health food store retailers, and magazines; to prefer supplementation education via individual interviews; to claim awareness of anti-doping rules; and to perceive anti-doping compliance. Relative to gender, significant differences were observed for the types of DS reported; supplementation advisors; justifications for DS use; and awareness of anti-doping regulations.; CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of this validated and reliable questionnaire has the potential for broad use and provides insight into the factors that influence DS use in elite athletes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify and compare the drug-injecting network characteristics of cocaine and heroin injectors associated with a risk of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV).; METHODS: Active injectors were recruited from syringe exchange and methadone programs. Characteristics of all participants and their social networks were elicited. Regression analysis using generalized estimating equations examined the network characteristics of injection drug users (IDUs) relative to cocaine or heroin use in the past 6 months.; RESULTS: Of 282 IDUs, 228 (81%) used cocaine and 54 (19%) used heroin as their primary injected drug. In analyses adjusted for age and gender, cocaine injectors compared with heroin injectors were more likely to live in unstable housing (odds ratio [OR] = 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 8.40), self-report HCV infection (OR = 4.69, 95% CI: 2.14 to 10.31), and have a greater number of IDUs in their social network (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.28) and were less likely to be polydrug users (OR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.16) and to have social support (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95 to 0.99). The injecting networks of cocaine users were more likely to have members who were older (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.12), had a history of shooting gallery use (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.76), and had shorter relationships with the subject (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.97).; CONCLUSIONS: Beyond personal behaviors, HIV and HCV infection risk seems to be linked to social network traits that are determined by drug type. Prevention efforts to control the spread of bloodborne viruses among IDUs could benefit from tailoring interventions according to the type of drug used.

AB The drinkable yogurt marketplace is a competitive and growing category in the dairy industry. Understanding sensory differences is critical for understanding the product, and ultimately, consumer preference. The objective of this study was to identify and define the sensory characteristics of commercial drinkable yogurts and link these specific sensory attributes to consumer preferences among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic consumers in the United States. Focus groups with each ethnic group (n = 10 for each group) were conducted to gain insights into perceptions of drinkable yogurts. A descriptive sensory language was identified to document the sensory properties (visual, flavor, and mouthfeel) of drinkable yogurts. Thirteen commercial drinkable yogurts (strawberry flavor) were subsequently evaluated by a trained sensory panel using the developed sensory language. Five representative yogurts were chosen for consumer testing by each ethnic group (minimum of 75 consumers per group). Both internal and external preference mapping was conducted to identify key drivers of liking. Drinkable yogurts were differentiated by descriptive analysis in visual, flavor, and mouthfeel attributes. Variability was observed in consumer acceptability across the 3 ethnic groups, but these differences were small compared with differences observed among 3 identified consumer preference clusters regardless of ethnicity. Key drivers for all 3 clusters were natural strawberry flavor/aroma and sweet taste. The influence of intensity changes in these 3 drivers along with the presence or absence of other attributes differentiated the 3 clusters. Acceptability varies widely among consumers, and drinkable yogurts with specific flavor and physical properties could be marketed to specific target market segments. The results indicate that these consumer clusters are not defined solely by ethnicity.

AB Suicide accounts for over 30,000 deaths per year in the United States and is associated with psychiatric illness and substance abuse. Research suggests a strong relationship between method of suicide and the lethal means that are readily available in one's community of residence. However, certain individuals may also seek the opportunity for suicide outside their proximal environment, often in well-known places. Whereas prevention efforts have been aimed at certain repeatedly used sites for suicide (i.e., Golden Gate Bridge), little research has studied "suicide tourism," the phenomenon of out of town accompanied by suicide. We collected data on all suicide deaths in New York City (NYC) between 1990 and 2004 from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of NYC. We examined trends and correlates of out-of-town residents who committed suicide in NYC. Manhattan accounted for 274 of the 407 nonresident suicides in NYC, which represented over 10% of all suicides committed in Manhattan. The most common methods of suicide for the Manhattan nonresidents were long fall, hanging, overdose, drowning, and firearms; the most common locations included hotels and commercial buildings, followed by outside locations such as bridges, parks, and streets. Nonresident victims tended to be younger, more often white and Asian and less often black and Hispanic than their residential counterparts. An analysis of nonresident suicides in Manhattan revealed that it is a location where individuals travel and take their lives, often by similar means and in similar locations. A comparison with residential suicide implied that a different type of individual is at risk for nonresidential suicide, and further research and prevention efforts should be considered.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern and prevalence of food and drink advertisements to children on commercial television in Sydney, Australia, and compare these with advertising regulations set out in the Children's Television Standards and results from a similar study in 2002.; DESIGN: Data were collected by recording television from 06.00 hours until 23.00 hours on all three commercial channels from Sunday 14 May 2006 to Saturday 20 May 2006 (357 h). The study analysed advertisements in two children's viewing periods, one as defined in the 2002 study and the other according to current standards. Food advertisements were coded using 18 food categories and were analysed by time period and popular children's programmes.; RESULTS: Food advertisements occurred in similar proportions during children's viewing hours and adult's viewing hours (25.5 vs. 26.9% of all advertisements, respectively), although there was a higher rate of high-fat/high-sugar food advertisements during children's viewing hours (49 vs. 39% of all food advertisements, P < 0.001). There were even more advertisements for high-fat/high-sugar foods during popular children's programmes, contributing to 65.9% of all food advertisements. Estimates of exposure indicate that children aged 5-12 years were exposed to 96 food advertisements, including 63 high-fat/high-sugar advertisements per week. Since 2002, there has been a reduction in overall food and high-fat/high-sugar food advertisements.; CONCLUSION: Despite reductions in overall levels of food advertising, children continue to experience high levels of exposure to food advertisements, which remain skewed towards unhealthy foods. Further food advertising regulation should be required to curtail the current levels of advertising of high-fat/high-sugar foods to children, to make them commensurate with recommended levels of consumption.

AB BACKGROUND: Energy drink consumption has continued to gain in popularity since the 1997 debut of Red Bull, the current leader in the energy drink market. Although energy drinks are targeted to young adult consumers, there has been little research regarding energy drink consumption patterns among college students in the United States. The purpose of this study was to determine energy drink consumption patterns among college students, prevalence and frequency of energy drink use for six situations, namely for insufficient sleep, to increase energy (in general), while studying, driving long periods of time, drinking with alcohol while partying, and to treat a hangover, and prevalence of adverse side effects and energy drink use dose effects among college energy drink users.; METHODS: Based on the responses from a 32 member college student focus group and a field test, a 19 item survey was used to assess energy drink consumption patterns of 496 randomly surveyed college students attending a state university in the Central Atlantic region of the United States.; RESULTS: Fifty one percent of participants (n = 253) reported consuming greater than one energy drink each month in an average month for the current semester (defined as energy drink user). The majority of users consumed energy drinks for insufficient sleep (67%), to increase energy (65%), and to drink with alcohol while partying (54%). The majority of users consumed one energy drink to treat most situations although using three or more was a common practice to drink with alcohol while partying (49%). Weekly jolt and crash episodes were experienced by 29% of users, 22% reported ever having headaches, and 19% heart palpitations from consuming energy drinks. There was a significant dose effect only for jolt and crash episodes.; CONCLUSION: Using energy drinks is a popular practice among college students for a variety of situations. Although for the majority of situations assessed, users consumed one energy drink with a reported frequency of 1 - 4 days per month, many users consumed three or more when combining with alcohol while partying. Further, side effects from consuming energy drinks are fairly common, and a significant dose effect was found with jolt and crash episodes. Future research should identify if college students recognize the amounts of caffeine that are present in the wide variety of caffeine-containing products that they are consuming, the amounts of caffeine that they are consuming in various situations, and the physical side effects associated with caffeine consumption.

AB This study utilizes Bronfenbrenner's ecological model (1979) to examine multiple and interactive environmental (familial, social, and cultural) predictors of adolescent alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. A stratified random sample of 401 American Indian youths was interviewed in 2001. The findings showed that family members' substance problems, peer misbehaviors, and participation in generic cultural activities positively predicted adolescent alcohol symptoms. Conversely, cultural pride/spirituality predicted fewer alcohol symptoms, and, importantly, religious affiliation moderated the effects of problematic peers and family members on adolescent alcohol symptoms. The findings suggest further study of intervention and prevention efforts regarding the benefits from consideration of the complex relationships among multiple environmental variables.

AB BACKGROUND: Bridging the Gap (BTG) is a collaborative research initiative supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Ten years ago, BTG was created to assess the impact of policies, programs, and other environmental influences on adolescent alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use and related outcomes. This multidisciplinary, multisite initiative examines these factors at multiple levels of social organization, including schools, communities, and states. More recently, the significant increases in obesity among children, adolescents, and adults led BTG to expand its efforts to include research on the role of policies, programs, and other factors on adolescent obesity and the physical inactivity and dietary habits that contribute to this growing problem. Eleven papers resulting from BTG's obesity-related research are contained in this supplement, along with two papers describing the National Cancer Institute-supported efforts to track relevant state policies.; METHODS: Bridging the Gap involves a variety of data-collection efforts built largely around the Monitoring the Future (MTF) surveys of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students. These include: surveys of administrators in the MTF schools that gather extensive information on the school food environment, physical education in schools, and other relevant information; collection of contextual information from the communities in which the MTF schools are located; tracking of relevant state policies; and gathering of a wide variety of data from archival and commercial databases. These databases are analyzed individually and in various combinations.; DISCUSSION: Bridging the Gap's extensive research has shown the importance of a range of school, community, state, and other influences in affecting adolescent substance use and related outcomes. BTG's early research on adolescent diet, physical activity, and obesity--much of which is contained in this supplement--similarly demonstrates the role of environmental factors in influencing these outcomes and in explaining observed racial/ethnic and socioeconomic-related disparities in them.; CONCLUSIONS: The growing recognition of the public health and economic consequences of childhood, adolescent, and adult obesity has led to a variety of policies, programs, and other interventions to stimulate healthy eating and physical activity, often despite the lack of evidence on their impact. BTG and others are working to build the evidence base for effective interventions to address this significant problem, but much remains to be learned.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify precursors of adolescent alcohol initiation and binge drinking.; DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.; SETTING: Self-report questionnaires.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5511 Growing Up Today Study participants aged 11 to 18 years in 1998. Main Exposures Individual, family, and social factors.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First whole drink of alcohol and binge drinking.; RESULTS: Between 1998 and 1999, 611 girls (19%) and 384 boys (17%) initiated alcohol use. Older age, later maturational stage, smoking, adults drinking in the home, underage sibling drinking, peer drinking, possession of or willingness to use alcohol promotional items, and positive attitudes toward alcohol were associated with an increased likelihood of alcohol initiation. Girls who ate family dinner at home every day were less likely to initiate alcohol use than girls who ate family dinner only on some days or never (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.87). Girls with higher social self-esteem and boys with higher athletic self-esteem were more likely to initiate alcohol use than those with lower self-esteem. Among teens who initiated alcohol use, 149 girls (24%) and 112 boys (29%) further engaged in binge drinking. Among girls, positive attitudes toward alcohol, underage sibling drinking, and possession of or willingness to use alcohol promotional items were associated with binge drinking; among boys, positive attitudes toward alcohol and older age were associated with binge drinking.; CONCLUSIONS: Eating family dinner at home every day may delay alcohol uptake among some adolescents. Alcohol promotional items appear to encourage underage alcohol initiation and binge drinking; this may warrant marketing restrictions on the alcohol industry.

AB BACKGROUND: Higher serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels, a marker of oxidative stress, are implicated in the development and progression of hypertension; however, data from non-Caucasian ethnicities are limited. Also, currently there is little data available on the association between serum GGT level and clinically relevant blood pressure (BP) categories earlier in the disease continuum, when hypertension prevention efforts may be applicable. The association between serum GGT and prehypertension was examined in a nationally representative sample of US adults.; METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional study among 5,827 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 participants aged > or =18 years without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension. The main outcome-of-interest was the presence of prehypertension (systolic BP 120-139 mmHg or diastolic BP 80-89 mmHg) (n=2,269). Higher serum GGT levels were positively associated with prehypertension, independent of smoking, waist circumference, diabetes, cholesterol levels and other confounders. The multivariable odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) comparing quartile 4 of GGT (>29 U/L) to quartile 1 (<13 U/L) was 1.84 (1.37-2.46), p<0.0001. This association persisted in separate analyses among men and women. The results were consistent in subgroup analyses by race-ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, waist circumference and diabetes. In non-parametric models, the positive association between serum GGT and prehypertension appeared to be present across the full range of GGT, without any threshold effect.; CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum GGT levels are associated with prehypertension in a nationally representative sample of US adults, free of CVD and hypertension.

AB BACKGROUND: To assess whether movie alcohol exposure is associated with alcohol use during early adolescence.; METHODS: We conducted a survey of adolescents (N = 5,581) from 27 schools in Germany. Each was asked if he/she had seen a list of 50 movie titles, randomly selected from a sample of 398 US box office hits released there. Screen alcohol use was timed for each movie, summed for movies each adolescent had seen, and adjusted to reflect exposure to all 398 movies. We assessed the association between this exposure and any alcohol use without parental knowledge (WPK) and binge drinking (>or= 5 drinks).; RESULTS: Alcohol use was depicted in 88% of the 398 movies. Median exposure to movie alcohol use was 3.44 h (interquartile range = 1.51-6.23 h). Overall 36.6% of subjects used alcohol WPK and 18.1% reported binge drinking. Movie alcohol exposure was directly associated with alcohol use WPK and binge drinking, after controlling for multiple covariates including sociodemographics, personality characteristics and social influences. Compared with quartile one, the adjusted odds of alcohol use WPK were 1.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.82], 2.12 (1.75-2.57) and 2.95 (2.35-3.70) for quartiles 2, 3 and 4, respectively; similarly, adjusted odds of binge drinking were 1.42 (0.93-2.28), 1.84 (1.27-2.67) and 2.59 (1.70-3.95).; CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an association between exposure to alcohol use in US movies and alcohol use without parental knowledge in Germany, and is the first study to link movie exposure with binge drinking. Given international distribution of US movies, depicted behaviours may influence adolescents outside the country of origin.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether perceiving portrayals of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos was associated with adverse health outcomes among African American adolescent females.; METHODS: African American female adolescents (n = 522) were recruited from community venues. Adolescents completed a survey consisting of questions on sociodemographic characteristics, rap music video viewing habits, and a scale that assessed the primary predictor variable, portrayal of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos. Adolescents also completed an interview that assessed the health outcomes and provided urine for a marijuana screen.; RESULTS: In logistic regression analyses, adolescents who perceived more portrayals of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos were more likely to engage in binge drinking (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.32-11.04, p = 0.01), test positive for marijuana (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.19-9.85, p = 0.02), have multiple sexual partners (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.01-3.71, p = 0.04), and have a negative body image (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.02-2.26, p = 0.04). This is one of the first studies quantitatively examining the relationship between cultural images of sexual stereotypes in rap music videos and a spectrum of adverse health outcomes in African American female adolescents.; CONCLUSIONS: Greater attention to this social issue may improve the health of all adolescent females.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining the relationship between physical activity levels and broad-based measures of psychological wellbeing in adolescents have been limited by not controlling for potentially confounding variables. The present study examined the relationship between adolescents' self-reported physical activity level, sedentary behaviour and psychological wellbeing; while controlling for a broad range of sociodemographic, health and developmental factors.; METHODS: The study entailed a cross-sectional school-based survey in ten British towns. Two thousand six hundred and twenty three adolescents (aged 13-16 years) reported physical activity levels, patterns of sedentary behaviour (TV/computer/video usage) and completed the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ).; RESULTS: Lower levels of self-reported physical activity and higher levels of sedentary behaviour showed graded associations with higher SDQ total difficulties scores, both for boys (P < 0.001) and girls (P < 0.02) after adjustment for age and town. Additional adjustment for social class, number of parents, predicted school examination results, body mass index, ethnicity, alcohol intake and smoking status had little effect on these findings.; CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of self-reported physical activity are independently associated with diminished psychological wellbeing among adolescents. Longitudinal studies may provide further insights into the relationship between wellbeing and activity levels in this population. Ultimately, randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of increasing physical activity on psychological wellbeing among adolescents.

AB Fatal and nonfatal injuries due to suicidal behavior among younger adolescents are of growing concern for many communities. We examined the incidence and patterns of these injuries among persons aged 10-14 years using three databases, two national and a third from Oregon. Suffocation and firearm gunshot were the leading external causes of suicide; poisoning and cutting/piercing were the leading causes of nonfatal self-harm injuries. The most common psychosocial factors associated with those treated in emergency departments for self-harm injuries were psychological conditions; drug/alcohol involvement; and adverse circumstances, including family discord, school problems, and physical/sexual abuse. Analysis of population-based data from these databases are part of the public health approach and can help direct much needed research and prevention efforts that address self-harming behavior in these younger adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine what hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection means to street-involved young IDUs (SYIDUs) and how this impacts on their health behaviours, based on social contexts in which they live.; METHODS: Thirty-nine SYIDUs with HCV infection participated in in-depth interviews. A typology was built founded on SYIDUs' street life and drug use experiences. The meanings given to hepatitis C and resulting health behaviours were examined through these experiences.; RESULTS: In Montreal, "total" experience is characterised by an exclusive social relationship with the street milieu and by intensive drug consumption. In this milieu, where most injectors are HCV-infected but asymptomatic, getting infected is considered trivial. Compared to other more immediate threats, HCV infection and its long-term consequences are lesser concerns. Efforts to inject safely are made to avoid HIV. When these SYIDUs learn they are HCV-infected, they do not make important lifestyle changes. However, since they worry about transmitting the infection to others, they notify their injection partners that they are infected. SYIDUs living a "controlled" experience preserve some stability in their lives and control their consumption. They maintain relationships within mainstream society and have beliefs reflecting these links. They view HCV infection as a serious disease and make significant efforts to avoid sharing their injection equipment and thus remain healthy. When they learn they are HCV-infected, they engage in "liver friendly" behaviours but are not ready to stop injecting. The "disengaging" experience is that of youth who start to disengage from drug injection. They leave the drug milieu and develop new relationships within mainstream society. They adopt new values regarding health. HCV infection is viewed as requiring significant changes in strategies aimed at protecting themselves and others.; CONCLUSION: This research sheds light on the fundamentally social nature of hepatitis C. SYIDUs' HCV experiences, which evolve in parallel with their street life and consumption trajectories, provide numerous occasions where they can be exposed to prevention messages.

AB The rising prevalence of obesity among children and youth worldwide has been associated with marketing of unhealthy food products and drinks directed towards these age groups. Consumer organizations and several states want to regulate such marketing by law, but commercial actors prefer self-regulation. International human rights, including the rights to food and health, provide arguments for legal regulation of commercial conduct in matters where health and nutritional status may be affected negatively. There is an increasing awareness of the fact that human rights require states to take effective measures to counteract obesity and related diseases. This may give rise to a more systematic use of human rights for protection and promotion of public health in general.

AB BACKGROUND: A number of studies using cross-sectional data have demonstrated that the availability of alcohol, measured by the number and types of alcohol outlets, is directly related to numerous measures associated with drinking and driving. The current study contributes the first observation of relationships over time between alcohol outlet densities on one hand and both automobile crashes and related injuries on the other hand.; METHOD: The study examined longitudinal data from 581 consistently defined zip code areas represented in the California Index Locations Database, a geographic information system that coordinates population and ecological data with spatial attributes for areas across the state. Six years of data were collected on features of local populations (e.g., demographics, household size) and places (e.g., retail markets) thought to be related to two measures of automobile crashes (hospital discharges related to car crash injuries geocoded to the zip code of patient residence, and police reports associated with car crashes geocoded to the zip code of crash location). Both crash measures were positively associated with two outlet types: bars, and off-premise outlets. Additionally, restaurants appear to provide a protective effect relative to the residence-based measure. Crash rates were also related to changes in population and place characteristics using random effects models with controls for spatial autocorrelation (nxt=3486 observations). Changes in population and place characteristics of adjacent (spatially lagged) areas were also considered.; RESULTS: Over time, both local and lagged population and place characteristics were related to automobile crash-related measures.; CONCLUSION: Controlling for cross-sectional differences between zip code areas, changes in numbers of licensed alcohol retail establishments, especially bars and off-premise outlets, affect rates of car crashes and related injuries.

AB AIMS: To identify how current public health policies of 12 developed countries assess alcohol-related problems, the goals and targets that are set and the strategic directives proposed.; METHODS: Policy documents on alcohol and on general public heath were obtained through repeated searches of government websites. Documents were reviewed by two independent observers.; RESULTS: All the countries studied state that alcohol causes substantial harm to individual health and family well-being, increases crime and social disruption, and results in economic loss through lost productivity. All are concerned about consumption of alcohol by young adults and by heavy and problem drinkers. Few aim to reduce total consumption. Only five of the countries set specific targets for changes in drinking behaviour. Countries vary in their commitment to intervene, particularly on taxation, drink-driving, the drinking environment and for high-risk groups. Australia and New Zealand stand out as having coordinated intervention programmes in most areas.; CONCLUSIONS: Policies differ markedly in their organization, the goals and targets that are set, the strategic approaches proposed and areas identified for intervention. Most countries could improve their policies by following the recommendations in the World Heath Organization's European Alcohol Action Plan.

AB BACKGROUND: Although binge drinking (drinking five or more drinks on an occasion) is an important public health problem, little is known about which beverage types are consumed by binge drinkers. This knowledge could guide prevention efforts because beer, wine, and liquor are taxed, marketed, and distributed differently.; METHODS: Data from 14,150 adult binge drinkers who responded to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System binge-drinking module in 2003 and 2004 were analyzed. Information pertained to the amount of alcohol consumed during a binge drinker's most recent binge episode, including beverage-specific consumption.; RESULTS: Overall, 74.4% of binge drinkers consumed beer exclusively or predominantly, and those who consumed at least some beer accounted for 80.5% of all binge alcohol consumption. By beverage type, beer accounted for 67.1%, liquor for 21.9%, and wine accounted for 10.9% of binge drinks consumed. Beer also accounted for most of the alcohol consumed by those at highest risk of causing or incurring alcohol-related harm, including people aged 18-20 years (67.0% of drinks were beer); those with three or more binge episodes per month (70.7%); those drinking eight or more drinks per binge episode (69.9%); those binging in public places (64.4%); and those who drove during or within 2 hours of binge drinking (67.1%).; CONCLUSIONS: Beer accounted for two thirds of all alcohol consumed by binge drinkers and accounted for most alcohol consumed by those at greatest risk of causing or incurring alcohol-related harm. Lower excise taxes and relatively permissive sales and marketing practices for beer as compared with other beverage types may account for some of these findings. These findings suggest that equalizing alcohol control policies at more stringent levels would be an effective way to prevent excessive drinking.

AB Relatively little is known about how youth obtain marijuana and other drugs. The Drugs, Alcohol and Violence International (DAVI) study explored youthful drug markets among samples of school students, detained youth, and school dropouts (ages 14-17 years) in the greater metropolitan areas of Philadelphia, Toronto, Montreal, and Amsterdam. Students frequently reported sharing drugs, either getting them from others or giving them to others for free. Sharing was less common among the more drug-involved detainees and dropouts. Marijuana was typically obtained either outdoors or in a house or apartment. Few youth reported getting marijuana at school. In Amsterdam, where marijuana can be purchased in small quantities in coffeeshops, this was the most common place to get marijuana, even though 18 is the legal age for purchase. Alcohol was also most likely to be obtained in stores or restaurants across all the sites, even though none were of legal age except those in Amsterdam age 16 or older. Youth most often reported purchasing marijuana in nickel, dime or other small bags, which are not standardized units. The exception again was Amsterdam, where youth most often reported quantities in grams or joints, which is how it is sold in coffeeshops. The lack of standardization of units makes economic cost estimates suspect. Even standardized units such as alcohol present problems since youth report a wide range of 'typical purchases.' Survey data can, however, more aptly describe drug market characteristics such as general location of purchase, and relationship with the seller.

AB INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Binge drinking is a major public health issue in Australia, particularly among young people. There has been a considerable focus on alcohol advertising, among both researchers and policy makers, resulting in efforts to bring about some level of regulation of unacceptable advertising practices. However - despite the existence of a Code of Practice for Responsible Promotion of Liquor Products which provides 'a framework of practices which are considered acceptable and reasonable' for licensed premises - there are few, if any, data on the nature and extent of promotions which could arguably fall under either 'acceptable' or 'unacceptable' practices.; DESIGN AND METHODS: Over an 8-week period we monitored promotions offered by licensed venues (pubs, bars and clubs) in the Wollongong central area. Seventeen venues were identified, and each venue was visited daily for 1 week. Trained research assistants took notes on all promotions/events in visited venues, including both manufacturer- and management-initiated.; RESULTS: We identified a range of different types of promotions, including low cost and free drinks. Some of the promotions identified could be seen to have a positive public health impact, such as free food and free transport. However, the majority of promotions were of a nature likely to increase the likelihood of excessive drinking.; DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: It is evident from this review that there are numerous examples of promotions which breach both the spirit and the letter of the Code. It is equally evident that the system for monitoring compliance with the Code is fundamentally inadequate.

AB INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Alcohol misuse is responsible for extensive personal harm and high societal costs. Research related specifically to women's alcohol consumption is important due to gender differences in clinical outcomes and disease progression.; DESIGN AND METHODS: This study examines longitudinal changes in the patterns of alcohol consumption associated with harm in the long term (chronic) and short term (acute) as defined by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. Results are presented for three age cohorts (18 - 23 years, 45 - 50 years and 70 - 75 years) using data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health 1996 - 2003. Initial response rates for the study were 41%, 54% and 36% for the Younger, Mid-aged and Older cohort, respectively.; RESULTS: The percentages of women that initiated usual weekly consumption in excess of 140 g of alcohol, designated as long-term risky or high risk consumption, between surveys 1 and 2 were 2.7%, 2.1% and 1.7% (Younger, Mid-aged and Older cohorts, respectively). Similarly, between surveys 1 and 2, 7.8% of younger women and 2.5% of mid-aged women initiated consumption of 50 g of alcohol on one occasion at least weekly, placing them at risk of alcohol-related harm in the short-term weekly. Examining data across the three time-points in the Younger cohort, 0.3% of women were at risk of alcohol-related harm in the long term across all three time-points, and 9.2% were at risk at one or two time-points. The percentage of younger women at risk of alcohol-related harm in the short term at least weekly was 3.4% at risk at all three time-points and 24% at risk at one or two time-points.; DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that there is a small percentage of women who maintain levels of alcohol consumption associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality over time, but a much larger proportion of women that drink at hazardous levels sporadically during the life course. Prevention efforts may need to target transient high-risk alcohol consumers differently than consistently heavy alcohol consumers. Non-response bias and attrition may have caused the prevalence of both entrenched and episodic heavy consumption to be underestimated.

AB The aim of this study was to provide a current assessment of Australian secondary students' self-reported dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. This study also examined the relationship between television viewing and students' dietary behaviour. Data are from a cross-sectional survey of 18 486 secondary students in 2005 from all Australian states except Western Australia. Participants reported their usual daily consumption (number of serves) of vegetables and fruit; their weekly consumption of unhealthy/non-core foods including fast food meals, snack foods and high-energy drinks; their engagement in moderate-vigorous physical activity over the previous week; and hours spent using electronic media for entertainment and doing homework on school days. The study found that 20% of students were meeting the daily requirement of four serves of vegetables, whereas 39% were eating the recommended three daily serves of fruit. Consumption of unhealthy/non-core foods was high, with 46% of students having fast food meals at least twice a week, 51% eating snack foods four or more times per week and 44% having high-energy drinks four or more times per week. Fourteen per cent of students engaged in recommended levels of physical activity and 29% engaged in recommended levels of sedentary behaviour. Age and gender differences occurred for most measures, and there were some socio-economic status differences. Heavier television use was associated with lower consumption of fruit and higher consumption of unhealthy/non-core foods. On the basis of the results of this study, it appears that a significant proportion of Australian secondary students fall short of current, national dietary and physical activity recommendations for teenagers. Continual monitoring of these behaviours is essential to help inform research and policy and identify where future efforts should be directed.

Response rate was 81.5%.; VARIABLES MEASURED: Intake of fruits, total vegetables, dark green/yellow vegetables, calcium-rich food, grains, soft drinks, fried food, snack food, calories, family meal frequency, and watching television during meals.; ANALYSIS: General linear modeling comparing dietary intake across 3 groups.; RESULTS: 33.5% of boys and 30.9% of girls reported watching television during family meals. Adolescents watching television were found to have lower intakes of vegetables, dark green/yellow vegetables, calcium-rich food, and grains and higher intakes of soft drinks compared to adolescents not watching television during meals. However, watching television during family meals was associated with a more healthful diet than not eating regular family meals.; CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Watching television during family meals was associated with poorer dietary quality among adolescents. Health care providers should work with families and adolescents to promote family meals, emphasizing turning the TV off at meals.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify individual and environmental factors affecting intake of calcium-rich food and beverages by early adolescent Hmong girls.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of girls, in-depth interviews with parents.; SETTING: Girl Scout and 4-H programs in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area.; PARTICIPANTS: Convenience samples of 10-13-year-old Hmong girls (n = 102) and their parents (n = 20).; ANALYSIS: Spearman correlation analysis, constant comparative method.; VARIABLES MEASURED: Individual and environmental factors for girls and reported intake of calcium-rich food and beverages.; RESULTS: Few girls observed parents drinking milk or were encouraged by parents to drink milk. Many reported low intake of milk with dinner meals and snacks. Only one third reported that calcium-rich food such as yogurt, cheese, and tofu were available at home, and intake of these food items was associated with availability. Parents accommodated child preferences and had few expectations for their child to eat certain calcium-rich food items. Parents did not commonly consume dairy products but indicated they made milk available for children. Knowledge of calcium requirements was limited, but most parents related calcium to bone health.; CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Environmental factors may limit calcium intake by Hmong girls. Education should involve parents and children and address environmental factors that affect intake.

AB OBJECTIVES: Maternal alcohol use is a leading preventable cause of neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities in children. This study examines the patterns and average volume of alcohol use among U.S. women of childbearing age in order to identify subgroups of high-risk women for selective intervention.; METHODS: A sample of 188,290 women aged 18-44 years participated in the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC)'s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey during the period of 2001-2003. Reported alcohol use patterns and average volume were examined for pregnant and nonpregnant women. Efforts were made to evaluate and characterize women who practiced various levels of binge drinking.; RESULTS: The results showed that approximately 2% of pregnant women and 13% of nonpregnant women in the United States engaged in binge drinking during the period of 2001-2003. Among the estimated average of 6.7 million women of childbearing age overall who engaged in binge drinking during the period, approximately 28.5% women also reported consuming an average of 5 drinks or more on typical drinking days, or about 21.4% women consumed at least 45 drinks on average in a month. Larger proportions of binge drinkers with high usual quantity of consumption were found among women of younger ages (18-24 years) or current smokers.; CONCLUSIONS: Future prevention efforts should include strategies that combine health messages and encourage women of childbearing age, with particular emphasis on women 18-24 years, to avoid alcohol and tobacco use, and take multivitamins and folic acid daily for better pregnancy outcomes. Other efforts must also include broad-based implementation of screening and brief intervention for alcohol misuse in primary and women's health care settings.

AB BACKGROUND: The Pacific OPIC Project (Obesity Prevention In Communities) includes whole-of-community intervention programs in four countries (Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand, Australia) aimed at reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in youth.; DEVELOPMENT OF ACTION PLANS: At each intervention site, preliminary interviews were conducted with youth to identify the potential socio-cultural barriers and facilitators to healthy eating and regular physical activity in order to attain and sustain a healthy body size. This and other information was presented at a 2-day workshop with community stakeholders, including youth. The participants then prioritised the components for a draft action plan which was later consolidated through further community consultation.; ACTION PLAN OBJECTIVES: Each action plan had two overall aims: to build community capacity and to promote healthy weight. The first three objectives in each action plan were on capacity building, social marketing messages, and evaluation. Next were a set of four to five behavioural objectives with associated strategies involving programs, events, social marketing and environmental change. Lastly, each site had one or two innovative or developmental objectives.; PROGRESS: Interventions began in all sites from 2005, with the action plans guiding implementation priorities. The initial behavioural objective for targeting in Fiji was eating regular breakfast and meals throughout the day, for Tonga it was physical activity, and for Australia and New Zealand it was increasing water consumption and decreasing consumption of sweet drinks.; CONCLUSIONS: The action plans have provided the basis for community engagement in the project, the guide to the implementation of activities and the template for the evaluation plan.

AB OBJECTIVE: In light of the high rates of child and adolescent obesity, we examined the nutritional content of food advertising seen by American children and adolescents.; METHODS: We drew samples of top-rated television shows by using ratings data to examine the nutritional content for fat, saturated fat, sugar, sodium, and fiber of food-product advertisements seen on television by both children and adolescents. Food products were examined in aggregate and by 5 separate categories that included cereal, sweets, snacks, drinks, and other food products. For 2- to 11-year-olds and 12- to 17-year-olds, respectively, a sample of 50,351 and 47,955 30-second-equivalent food-product advertisements and their related nutritional content were weighted by television ratings data to provide actual exposure measures of the nutritional content of food advertising seen by children and adolescents.; RESULTS: Study results showed that 97.8% and 89.4% of food-product advertisements viewed by children 2 to 11 years old and adolescents 12 to 17 years old, respectively, were high in fat, sugar, or sodium. On average, 46.1% and 49.1% of total calories among the products advertised came from sugar in the advertisements seen by these respective age groups. A total of 97.6% of cereal advertisements seen by children 2 to 11 years old were for high-sugar cereals. No substantial differences were found in the nutritional content of advertisements seen by black and white children 2 to 11 years old. However, a slightly higher proportion of food advertisements in general and across all food-product categories seen by black versus white adolescents were for high-sugar products.; CONCLUSION: The overwhelming majority of food-product advertisements seen on television by American children and adolescents are of poor nutritional content.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess overweight and related risk factors among urban low socio-economic status (SES) African-American adolescents in an attempt to study the underlying causes of ethnicity and gender disparities in overweight.; METHODS: Cross-sectional data collected on anthropometric measures, diet, physical activity and family characteristics from 498 students in grades 5-7 in four Chicago public schools were analysed to study the risk factors for overweight using stepwise regression analysis.; RESULTS: Only 37.2% of the students lived with two parents. Nearly 90% had a television (TV) in their bedroom, and had cable TV and a video game system at home. Overall. 21.8% (17.7% boys versus 25.1% girls) were overweight (body mass index (BMI) >/= 95th percentile); and 39.8% had a BMI >/= 85th percentile. Compared with national recommendations, they had inadequate physical activity and less than desirable eating patterns. Only 66.1% reported having at least 20 min vigorous exercise or 30 min of light exercise in >/= 5 days over the past 7 days; 62.1% spent >3 h days- 1 watching TV/playing video games/computer, while 33.1% spent >/= 5 h days- 1. Their vegetable and fruit consumption was low, and they consumed too many fried foods and soft drinks: 55.1% consumed fried food twice or more daily and 19.5% four times or more daily; 70.3% consumed soft drinks twice or more daily and 22.0% four times or more daily on average. Gender, physical activity and pocket money were significant predictors of overweight (P < 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS: Several factors in the students' behaviours, school and family environments may increase overweight risk among this population. There is a great need for health promotion programmes with a focus on healthy weight and lifestyle, and targeting urban low-SES minority communities.

AB BACKGROUND: The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was used by a city school district (approximately 11,000 students) in the upper Midwest to monitor trends for nutrition and physical activity (PA) behaviors both within and between years and to compare with national 2003 data.; METHODS: Independent random samples were obtained in 1999 (387 middle school [MS] and 931 high school [HS]), in 2001 (322 MS and 367 HS), and in 2003 (658 MS and 1026 HS). A two-sample test of proportions was used.; RESULTS: Within each survey year, a higher proportion of MS compared to HS reported positive behaviors with some exceptions: (1) an increased proportion of HS having daily physical education (PE) and (2) a reduced proportion of HS reporting media time. Within 2003, a lower proportion of district females compared to males (MS and HS) reported participation in many measured behaviors. District trends overtime indicated a reduced proportion: (1) drinking milk (MS and HS), (2) eating breakfast (HS), and (3) watching television (MS). Trends overtime indicated an increased proportion: (1) using computers for fun (MS and HS), (2) participating in moderate PA (MS), and (3) daily PE (HS). District HS compared to national (2003) indicated a higher proportion: (1) drinking milk, (2) getting moderate PA, and (3) taking daily PE. District HS compared to national indicated a lower proportion: (1) at risk of overweight, (2) overweight, and (3) watching television.; CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of district YRBS trends provides both a database for informed decisions by the school district and an assessment model for other districts.

AB Alcohol consumption among persons aged 12-20 years contributes to the three leading causes of death (unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide) in this age group in the United States and is associated with other health-risk behaviors, including high-risk sexual activity, smoking, and physical fighting. Recent studies have documented the contribution of alcohol marketing to underage drinking. In 2000, the trade association for the wine industry changed its voluntary marketing code to stop advertising in magazines in which youths aged 12-20 years were >30% of the audience. In 2003, this threshold was adopted by the trade associations for beer and liquor producers. To determine the proportion of alcohol advertisements placed in magazines with disproportionately large youth readerships (i.e., >15% of readers aged 12-20 years) and to assess the proportion of youths exposed to these advertisements, the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth (Health Policy Institute, Georgetown University, District of Columbia) evaluated the placement of alcohol advertisements in 143 national magazines for which readership composition data were available for 2001-2005; these 143 publications accounted for approximately 90% of expenditures for all alcohol advertising in national print magazines. This report summarizes the results of that study, which indicated that alcohol advertising remained common in magazines with >15% youth readership but decreased substantially in magazines with >30% youth readership. These results suggest that although voluntary industry standards have reduced youth exposure to alcohol advertising in magazines, strengthening these standards by establishing a >15% youth readership threshold would further reduce exposure. In addition, independent monitoring of youth exposure to alcohol advertising should continue, as recommended by the U.S. Congress and Surgeon General.

AB This study examined the association among knowledge of someone who has died from AIDS, cognitive functioning, and performance of protective health behaviors to reduce the risk of contracting HIV. Baseline data were analyzed from a sample of 229 injection drug users (IDUs) of heroin, a subset of the respondents from the Baltimore site of the International Neurobehavioral HIV Study. Multivariate logistic regression equations were fitted to predict risky injection drug use practices and sexual behavior based on cognitive performance scores and knowledge of someone who had died from AIDS. Among IDUs with lower cognitive reserves, knowing someone who had died from AIDS was associated with increased risk. This finding indicates that more intensive efforts may be required to reduce the risky behaviors among those IDUs with lower cognitive scores in higher risk social groups. Among IDUs with greater cognitive reserves, knowing someone who had died from AIDS was associated with decreased risk. This suggests that cognitive performance can provide protection to individuals in riskier social environments. These findings can aid in targeting HIV prevention efforts toward higher risk individuals within the IDU population.

AB BACKGROUND: The alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) genotype affects the risk for alcoholism, with elevated prevalence of a protective allele in Jews. Alcohol consumption is increasing among younger Israeli Jews, reflecting environmental influences. We investigated whether the relationship of ADH1B genotype with alcohol consumption differed between younger and older adult Israelis.; METHODS: Israeli community residents aged 22 to 65 participated in a structured interview that included questions on the maximum number of drinks on an occasion (Maxdrinks). The ADH1B genotype was determined for 68 participants and dichotomized into nonprotective (ADH1B(*)1/1) and protective (ADH1B(*)1/2 or ADH1B(*)2/2) genotypes. Using Maxdrinks as the dependent variable, Poisson's regression was used to test an age x genotype interaction.; RESULTS: The ADH1B genotype interacted significantly with age (p=0.01) in a Poisson's model with Maxdrinks as the outcome. Among participants >or=33 years, Maxdrinks was low and unrelated to the ADH1B genotype. Among participants <33 years with ADH1B(*)1/2 or ADH1B(*)2/2, Maxdrinks was also low (mean, 2.6 drinks) but among those with ADH1B(*)1/1, Maxdrinks was substantially higher (mean, 6.2 drinks).; CONCLUSION: Maximum lifetime drinking among younger adult Israelis without genetic protection exceeded thresholds for risky and unsafe drinking (>or=5 drinks). Environmental influences promoting greater drinking among younger Israelis may particularly affect those with the nonprotective, more common ADH1B genotype.

AB The need has never been greater to support healthy eating and physical activity in children and youth; the numbers of overweight and obese children have doubled and tripled, respectively, over the past 3 decades. Poor eating habits, including inadequate intake of vegetables, fruit, and milk, and eating too many high-calorie snacks, play a role in childhood obesity. Grain products provide the highest percentage (31%) of daily calories, followed by "other foods," which have limited nutritional value (22% of daily calories). Snacks account for 27% of total daily calories, which is more than the calories consumed at breakfast (18%) and lunch (24%), but not dinner (31%). For Canadians older than 4 years of age, more than 41% of daily snack calories come from other foods, such as chips, chocolate bars, soft drinks, fruit drinks, sugars, syrup, preserves, fats, and oils. Habits that protect against childhood obesity include eating more vegetables and fruit, eating meals with family, and being physically active. Children's food habits and choices are influenced by family, caregivers, friends, schools, marketing, and the media. Successful interventions for preventing childhood obesity combine family- and school-based programs, nutrition education, dietary change, physical activity, family participation, and counseling.

AB OBJECTIVE: The promotion of alcohol by retailers and media can contribute to a culture of excessive alcohol consumption, but the effect of non-advertising alcohol promotions has largely been neglected. This study sought to gather initial data on this important area.; METHOD: An observational study of alcohol point-of-sale promotions in the Wollongong CBD area, conducted in July-August 2005.; RESULTS: We identified 17 different promotions in three categories: gift with purchase; competitions; and buy some, get some free.; CONCLUSION: Given previous research demonstrating the relationship between increased alcohol consumption and both ownership of alcohol-related merchandise and reduced per unit price, it appears that point-of-sale promotions may have the potential to further increase alcohol consumption among young people.; IMPLICATIONS: Only when the extent and impact of such promotions is demonstrated will we be in a position to effectively advocate for appropriate regulations to ensure young people are not exposed to marketing strategies that further increase their exposure to alcohol-related harms.

AB Obesity is a major pediatric public health problem. Adolescents are a priority population for intervention strategies. School nurses are in key positions to design intervention strategies to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent adolescent obesity in the students they serve. To design effective programs, school nurses need to know what components their students perceive as important. This study involved the development and administration of a questionnaire to middle school students to determine their attitudes about overweight/obesity and what they felt would work for them. Adolescents are willing to exercise more, to change eating habits to include more fruits and vegetables, drink more water, and eat less junk food. They are not willing to give up soda, video/computer games, and watching television to improve their health. School nurses can use this questionnaire to collect data that will assist in the development of effective programs for their students.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe prospective transitions in smoking among young adult women who were occasional smokers, and the factors associated with these transitions, by comparing sociodemographic, lifestyle and psychosocial characteristics of those who changed from occasional smoking to daily smoking, non-daily smoking or non-smoking.; DESIGN: Longitudinal study with mailed questionnaires.; PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Women aged 18-23 years in 1996 were randomly selected from the Medicare Australia database, which provides the most complete list of people in Australia.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported smoking status at survey 1 (1996), survey 2 (2000) and survey 3 (2003), for 7510 participants who took part in all three surveys and who had complete data on smoking at survey 1.; RESULTS: At survey 1, 28% (n = 2120) of all respondents reported smoking. Among the smokers, 39% (n = 829) were occasional smokers. Of these occasional smokers, 18% changed to daily smoking at survey 2 and remained daily smokers at survey 3; 12% reported non-daily smoking at surveys 2 and 3; 36% stopped smoking and remained non-smokers; and 33% moved between daily, non-daily and non-smoking over surveys 2 and 3. Over the whole 7-year period, approximately half stopped smoking, one-quarter changed to daily smoking and the remainder reported non-daily smoking. Multivariate analysis identified that a history of daily smoking for > or = 6 months at baseline predicted reversion to daily smoking at follow-up. Being single and using illicit drugs were also associated with change to daily or non-daily smoking, whereas alcohol consumption was associated with non-daily smoking only. Compared with stopping smoking, the change to daily smoking was significantly associated with having intermediate educational qualifications. No significant associations with depression and perceived stress were observed in the multivariate analysis.; CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce the prevalence of smoking among young women need to take account of occasional smokers, who made up 39% of all smokers in this study. Targeted interventions to prevent the escalation to daily smoking and to promote cessation should allow for the social context of smoking with alcohol and other drugs, and social and environmental influences in vocational education and occupational settings.

AB OBJECTIVES: Drug overdose is the second leading cause of accidental deaths among U.S. adults aged 15-64 years. Emergency physicians have a unique opportunity to provide overdose prevention interventions, because habitual drug users are in frequent need of medical care. The authors evaluated associations between individual-level risk factors and experiencing an overdose in the past six months to determine which characteristics and behaviors may be most predictive of overdose.; METHODS: The authors used data from a sample of street-recruited habitual drug users who participated in face-to-face interviews about overdose from November 2001 to February 2004. This analysis was restricted to 772 respondents who had been injecting for at least one year and who had injected heroin within the past two months.; RESULTS: A total of 16.6% of participants had overdosed in the past six months. Characteristics and behaviors that were independently associated with an increased risk of a recent overdose were having had a prior overdose (odds ratio [OR], 28.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.10 to 57.96), using cocaine/crack in the past six months (OR, 2.07; 95% CI = 1.25 to 3.45), using alcohol in the past six months (OR, 1.90; 95% CI = 1.01 to 3.57), experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms in the past two months (OR, 2.70; 95% CI = 1.58 to 4.61), and younger age.; CONCLUSIONS: Drug users who have previously experienced a nonfatal overdose are at very high risk of experiencing future overdoses. Further longitudinal studies are needed to identify robust predictors of overdose risk over time in habitual drug users, but these data suggest that drug users who have overdosed warrant aggressive prevention efforts such as agonist maintenance treatment or provision of take-home naloxone.

AB School drug education is seen by governments as an ideal prevention strategy because it offers the potential to stop use by the next generation. Australian schools expanded drug education substantially during the 1960s in response to rising use by young people, and in 1970 the first national drug education programme was launched. In the mid-1990s the level and quality of drug education increased noticeably. Unfortunately, subsequent national initiatives have failed to capitalise on the gains made during this period. Some good quality, independent research, such as the Gatehouse Project and the School Health and Alcohol Harm Reduction Project (SHAHRP), has been conducted in Australia. However, national-level momentum is being lost, because there is little commitment to the development of evidence-based mass programmes. In this climate drug education has become vulnerable to short-term decision-making that emphasises palatable, policy-driven outcomes and focuses on strategies designed to bolster the legitimacy of these goals. So is Australia 'fair dinkum' about drug education in schools? There is a history of innovation, and past programmes have left behind pockets of expertise, but the challenge is to invest continuously in methods with evidence of success, rather than settle for cyclical programmes driven by the political and moral palliatives of the day. To do less is to fail the young people of Australia.

AB OBJECTIVE: Studies indicate greater sexual risk-taking behaviors and alcohol use in student-athletes compared with nonathletes, particularly in college samples. Although research has documented an association between drinking and risky sex, studies have not examined the role of sex motives in predicting risky sex in athletes. The purpose of the current study was to extend previous research on athletes' risk-taking behaviors by examining incoming college student-athletes and nonathletes' alcohol consumption, risky sexual behavior, and sex motives.; METHOD: Participants included 2,123 (58.9% female) incoming college students attending a northwest university, 221 of whom reported intercollegiate athletic participation during their upcoming year. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between sex motives and risky sexual behaviors using a cross-sectional design.; RESULTS: Results indicated greater weekly alcohol consumption, frequency of drinking before or during sex, and number of sexual partners in athletes compared with nonathletes. Athletes also reported greater levels of enhancement motives for sex and lower levels of intimacy motives than nonathletes, although no differences were found for coping motives. Significant interactions indicated that, for athletes, greater levels of enhancement sex motives predicted a greater number of sexual partners and more frequent drinking before or during sex, and greater levels of intimacy motives predicted less frequent drinking before or during sex.; CONCLUSIONS: Student-athletes are at risk for problematic outcomes associated with risky sex, including drinking before or during sex and having sex with multiple partners. Prevention efforts targeted at incoming college student-athletes should consider the role of sex motives.

AB OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this study were to determine (1) the extent of differential association of gender and age with being the victim of aggression by someone who has been drinking (i.e., alcohol-related victimization) for both verbal and physical forms of victimization and (2) whether drinking status/pattern interacts with gender and age in predicting verbal and physical victimization.; METHOD: A general population survey of Canadian adults ages 18-76 was conducted using random digit dialing and computer-assisted telephone interviewing. Respondents who reported verbal victimization only, physical victimization only, and any combination of verbal and physical victimization were compared with those who reported no victimization.; RESULTS: Verbal victimization was significantly more likely for women than for men, whereas physical victimization was more likely for men than for women. Younger age was more strongly associated with physical than with verbal victimization. In terms of significant interaction effects, the relationship between heavy episodic drinking (HED) and experiencing verbal victimization alone and combined verbal and physical victimization (but not for physical victimization alone) was significant for women but not for men. HED was significantly associated with experiencing combined verbal and physical victimization for younger people but not for older people.; CONCLUSIONS: Future research on alcohol-related victimization needs to take into consideration the nature of alcohol-related victimization (e.g., verbal vs physical) and potential interactions involving gender and age. The significant relationship between HED and combined verbal and physical victimization for younger persons suggests that prevention efforts aimed at decreasing heavy drinking among young people may reduce their risk of victimization.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) document and describe all outdoor alcohol advertisements surrounding schools and (2) examine the association between exposure to alcohol advertising in sixth grade and youth alcohol use, intentions, norms, and attitudes in eighth grade.; METHOD: All outdoor alcohol advertisements within 1,500 feet of 63 Chicago school sites were documented and coded for content and theme. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression analysis was used to determine the association between number of alcohol advertisements around a school in sixth grade and student alcohol behaviors, intentions, norms, and attitudes at the end of eighth grade, 2 years later. Participants included 2,586 sixth-grade students in the 2002-2003 school year. The sample was 37% black, 33% Hispanic, and 15% white. Gender was evenly distributed, and the average age was 12.2 at the end of sixth grade.; RESULTS: A total of 931 alcohol advertisements were found within 1,500 feet of the 63 school sites. Exposure to alcohol advertising around schools at the end of sixth grade was found to predict alcohol intentions at the end of eighth grade. This finding held true even for those students who were nonusers of alcohol in sixth grade.; CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to outdoor alcohol advertising around schools is associated with subsequent youth intentions to use alcohol. The association between exposure to alcohol advertising and youth alcohol-use intentions was found even among sixth-grade nonusers of alcohol, suggesting that even those who have not used alcohol are still influenced by alcohol advertising. These findings suggest that restrictions in alcohol advertising near schools may be warranted.

AB Addressing male heterosexual risk is a high priority for HIV prevention efforts in India. Particularly in urban India, which draws men for employment opportunities, these efforts are gaining momentum with a focus on understanding possible risk facilitators such as alcohol use. However, little is known about venues where such efforts might be targeted. In this paper, we explore community-based alcohol outlets or "wine shops" in Chennai, India, as potential venues. We conducted ethnographic research with wine shop staff and clients to understand alcohol use and sexual behaviors. We then surveyed 118 wine shop patrons to quantify these risk behaviors and plan an appropriate intervention. Our results show that wine shops are a venue where social and sexual networks converge. Reports and observations of regular and heavy drinking were frequent. Over 50% of patrons surveyed reported three or more sexual partners in the past 3 months, and 71% of all patrons reported a history of exchanging sex for money. Condom use history was low overall but, in the adjusted analyses, was significantly higher (OR = 20.1) among those who reported that their most recent partner was a sex worker and lower (OR = 0.28) among those who reported they drank to feel disinhibited. The data suggest that wine shops may be an appropriate location to target men for HIV prevention interventions. We discuss how these findings helped design such an intervention in Chennai.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in developed nations. In adolescent girls especially, rates of cannabis use have increased over the last decade, urging the need to characterize the potential correlates of onset of cannabis use during emerging adulthood.; METHOD: Using data from 1065 females (collected 1994-2005) who participated in both the baseline and follow-up wave of interviews of the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study, we examined the associations between correlates from the peer, parental and individual domains and new onsets of cannabis use, using logistic regression.; RESULTS: Univariate models revealed that initiation of cannabis use was associated with alcohol and cigarette use at baseline, peer attitude towards alcohol/cigarette/cannabis use, peer substance use and other aspects of impulse-disinhibited behavior. However, multivariate stepwise modeling retained only the significant influences of alcohol use at baseline and peer attitudes towards cannabis as correlates of cannabis initiation.; CONCLUSION: Having peers with favorable attitudes towards alcohol, cigarette and cannabis use is an important correlate of initiation of cannabis use in women. Prevention and intervention efforts need to take this into account when developing drug resistance training programs for adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND: Although an obvious environmental factor influencing drug use, the sources of individual differences in drug availability (DA) are unknown.; METHOD: This report is based on 1788 adult males from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry who participated in a structured telephone interview that included retrospective assessments of DA (cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and stimulants) between ages 8 and 25. We fitted a biometric dual change score (DCS) model, adapted for ordinal data, to model latent growth and estimate the genetic and environmental components of variance over time.; RESULTS: DA, despite being considered an environmental risk factor, is under both genetic and environmental control. For cigarette, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine availability, there was an overall increase in additive genetic variance and a decline in shared environmental variance over time. Non-shared environmental variance remained steady. Stimulant availability did not follow this pattern. Instead, there was an upswing in shared environmental effects with increasing age.; CONCLUSION: We have modeled the genetic and environmental architecture of changes in DA across adolescence. The rise in additive genetic variance over time coincides with acceleration in the expression of individual differences, probably brought on by an increase in personal freedom and a reduction in social constraints. Understanding the etiology of DA is likely to reveal key components, acting directly or indirectly, in the pathway(s) leading to drug initiation, abuse and dependence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the food habits and physical (in)activity patterns and to investigate the relationship with sociodemographic factors among Palestinian adolescents.; DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The Palestinian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) is a cross-sectional survey of grades 6, 8, 10 and 12. Students completed a modified version of the international HBSC questionnaire. A total of 8885 students were included in this analysis; 53% were from the West Bank and 47% from the Gaza Strip.; RESULTS: Adolescents in the West Bank consume more fruit, meat, chicken, sweets and soft drinks, but less vegetables than adolescents in Gaza (P<0.01). Girls reported more daily consumption of fruit, vegetables and sweets than boys (P<0.001), and less consumption of soft drinks, milk, meat and chicken (P<0.01). Boys were physically more active than girls (P<0.01), whereas girls reported doing more homework (P<0.001). Both boys and girls reported less physical activity with increasing age (P<0.001). Consumption of fruit and milk was positively associated with both parents' education, while consumption of meat, chicken and soft drinks was positively associated with mother's education only. Having breakfast on schooldays was positively associated with the father's education. Physical activity and television viewing were associated with the mother's education (P<0.01). The parents' level of education had no effect on vegetable consumption and dieting status.; CONCLUSION: This study indicated that there are problems with Palestinian adolescents' eating, dieting and physical activity. Regional, gender and parental socio-economic status differences should be taken into account in developing interventions. More detailed studies are needed with more elaborate instruments about food habits and physical activity of adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Voltarol for injection (a diclofenac sodium formulation employing polyethylene glycol and benzyl alcohol [PG-BA] as excipients) is marketed in Europe but not in North America. A suspension, PG-BA diclofenac sodium, requires preparation for each patient and slow IV infusion to minimize venous irritation. Dyloject, a novel diclofenac formulation, employs hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) to solubilize diclofenac in a small volume. We compared the efficacy and safety of an IV HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium bolus, a 30-minute PG-BA diclofenac sodium infusion, and placebo in post-molar extraction pain.; METHODS: A total of 155 adult patients were randomized to receive HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium 75 mg, PG-BA diclofenac sodium 75 mg, or placebo. Primary endpoints were superiority of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium to placebo and noninferiority of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium to PG-BA diclofenac sodium with respect to total pain relief over 4 hours (TOTPAR4) on a 0 to 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints included categorical TOTPAR4, VAS and categorical TOTPAR up to 8 hours, other measures of pain intensity and relief, patient global evaluation, and time to rescue medication.; RESULTS: HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium had efficacy superior to both placebo and PG-BA diclofenac sodium. At 15 minutes, more patients given HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium than PG-BA diclofenac sodium reported 30% reduction in pain intensity (52% vs. 21%, P = .0022). Both diclofenac products had a 6-hour duration of effect and were well tolerated. Patient global evaluations of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium were high, superior to placebo, and similar to PG-BA diclofenac sodium. The adverse event (AE) incidence was similar for HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium and PG-BA diclofenac sodium, except that in the current trial and in integrated safety results from the present and prior studies, phlebitis was more common with PG-BA diclofenac sodium. No cardiac or renal AEs or gastrointestinal bleeding were reported or observed.; CONCLUSIONS: IV bolus HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium produced analgesia more quickly than, and with equal duration as, the 30-minute PG-BA diclofenac sodium infusion. Pooled data on thrombophlebitis from the present investigation and our prior studies of the novel formulation indicate this adverse effect is less frequent and less severe with HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium than with PG-BA diclofenac sodium.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate whether adolescent readers attend to responsibility or moderation messages (e.g., "drink responsibly") included in magazine advertisements for alcoholic beverages and to assess the association between attention and the ability to accurately recall the content of these messages.; METHODS: An integrated head-eye tracking system (ASL Eye-TRAC 6000) was used to measure the eye movements, including fixations and fixation duration, of a group of 63 adolescents (ages 12-14 years) as they viewed six print advertisements for alcoholic beverages. Immediately after the eye-tracking sessions, participants completed a masked-recall exercise.; RESULTS: Overall, the responsibility or moderation messages were the least frequently viewed textual or visual areas of the advertisements. Participants spent an average of only .35 seconds, or 7% of the total viewing time, fixating on each responsibility message. Beverage bottles, product logos, and cartoon illustrations were the most frequently viewed elements of the advertisements. Among those participants who fixated at least once on an advertisement's warning message, only a relatively small percentage were able to recall its general concept or restate it verbatim in the masked recall test.; CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary responsibility or moderation messages failed to capture the attention of teenagers who participated in this study and need to be typographically modified to be more effective.

AB BACKGROUND: Heavy alcohol consumption rates are higher in the young adult military enlisted population than among civilians of the same age. The literature on alcohol availability, both generally and specifically with respect to work-related drinking, establishes clear links between ease of access, alcohol consumption rates and alcohol-related problems.; METHODS: In this paper, a qualitative analysis of 50 semi-structured interviews with U.S. Navy personnel was combined with quantitative findings from a mail survey of 713 young enlisted men and women in order to shed light on alcohol availability and its correlates in the home port environments of young adult enlisted personnel. The interviews were analyzed by two anthropologists seeking recurring themes or topics related to alcohol availability. These qualitative data were contextualized by descriptive statistics of the survey responses regarding ease of obtaining alcohol on and around naval bases, and from friends in and out of the Navy.; RESULTS: Findings associated with social and physical availability of alcohol include low prices in Navy Exchange base stores, frequent barracks parties, drink promotions in bars surrounding bases, and multiple opportunities for underage drinking despite age limits on alcohol purchases and official efforts to deglamorize alcohol use in the Navy. Both qualitative and qualitative findings suggest that respondents found alcohol and opportunities to drink overwhelmingly available in both on-base and off-base settings, and from friends both in and out of the Navy.; CONCLUSION: There is qualitative and quantitative evidence for extensive physical and social availability of alcohol in and around bases for young adults in the military. Policy implications include raising the presently tax-free alcohol prices in base stores and enforcing existing policies regarding underage drinking, particularly the provision of alcohol by people of legal drinking age, and by bars in and around bases. Cooperative preventive efforts with surrounding communities also offer promising ways for bases to reduce alcohol availability for young adult servicemembers.

AB BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARVT) is an important behavioral determinant of the success of ARVT. Nonadherence may lead to virological failure, and increases the risk of development of drug resistance. Understanding the prevalence of nonadherence and associated factors is important to inform secondary HIV prevention efforts.; METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used data from a cross-sectional interview study of persons with HIV conducted in 18 U.S. states from 2000-2004. We calculated the proportion of nonadherent respondents (took <95% of prescribed doses in the past 48 hours), and the proportion of doses missed. We used multivariate logistic regression to describe factors associated with nonadherence. Nine hundred and fifty-eight (16%) of 5,887 respondents reported nonadherence. Nonadherence was significantly (p<0.05) associated with black race and Hispanic ethnicity; age <40 years; alcohol or crack use in the prior 12 months; being prescribed >or=4 medications; living in a shelter or on the street; and feeling "blue" >or=14 of the past 30 days. We found weaker associations with having both male-male sex and injection drug use risks for HIV acquisition; being prescribed ARVT for >or=21 months; and being prescribed a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen not boosted with ritonavir. The median proportion of doses missed was 50%. The most common reasons for missing doses were forgetting and side effects.; CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Self-reported recent nonadherence was high in our study. Our data support increased emphasis on adherence in clinical settings, and additional research on how providers and patients can overcome barriers to adherence.

AB AIMS: Genetically influenced aspects of adolescent behaviour can play a role in alcohol use and peer affiliation. We explored the correlations between friends' alcohol use and adolescent own use with a genetically sensitive design.; DESIGN: Genetic and environmental factors were estimated on adolescent reports of their friends' alcohol use and their own use and problem use of alcohol. The correlations between the genetic and environmental factors that influence friends' alcohol use and adolescent own alcohol use and problem use were also estimated.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 862 twin pairs aged 11-17 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET).; MEASUREMENTS: Data on adolescent own alcohol use and problem use and the alcohol use of their three best friends were obtained using self-report questionnaires.; FINDINGS: A significant genetic influence was found on adolescent friends' alcohol use (about 30%). Significant correlations of 0.60 and 0.70 were found between the genetic influences on friends' alcohol use and adolescents' own use and problem use of alcohol. Common environmental influences were almost completely correlated for friends' alcohol use and adolescents' own alcohol use and problem use (0.91 and 0.94).; CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable overlap in the common environmental and genetic factors that contribute to the relationship between adolescents' own alcohol use and that of their friends. These findings contribute to understanding of the mechanisms by which friends' alcohol use influences adolescent drinking behaviour.

AB AIMS AND DESIGN: This study investigated equity of access to treatment and barriers to treatment for illicit drug use, using Andersen's behavioural model of health service utilization.; SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 492 drug users who had received treatment and 193 who had not.; MEASUREMENTS: Participants were interviewed to gather data relating to 19 predisposing, need and enabling variables.; FINDINGS: Never-treated participants exhibited less need for treatment than those who had received treatment. They experienced less negative emotion, used their main drug less often, had fewer drug-related health problems and fewer drug-using friends, were less likely to have blood-borne virus infections and were more likely to be using drugs for 'fun'. They also had more negative attitudes towards drug treatment staff, were less likely to believe that appropriate treatment was available and less likely to believe that professional help was necessary to get off drugs. Prevalence of physical and mental health problems was high in both groups.; CONCLUSIONS: The study documented significant unmet treatment need and identified several sources of inequity and barriers to treatment that would be amenable to policy and service development. Drug user organizations and peer educators and motivational interventions in primary care settings should be utilized to market the nature and benefits of treatment effectively, and to address the causes of drug users' negative attitudes towards treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study adapts Andersen's Behavioral Model to determine if health sector market conditions affect vulnerable subgroups' use of alcohol, drug, and mental health services (ADM) differently than the general population, focusing specifically on community-level predisposing and enabling characteristics.; DATA SOURCES: Wave 2 data (2000-2001) from the Health Care for Communities study, supplemented with cases from wave 1 (1997-1998), were merged with area characteristics taken from Census, Area Resource File (ARF), and other data sources.; STUDY DESIGN: The study used four-level hierarchical logistic regression to examine access to ADM care from any provider and specialty ADM access. Interactions between community-level predisposing and enabling vulnerability characteristics with individual race/ethnicity, age, income category, and insurance type were explored.; PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nonwhites, the poor, uninsured, and elderly had lower likelihoods of service use, but interactions between race/ethnicity, income, age and insurance status with community-level vulnerability factors were not statistically significant for any service use. For ADM specialty care, those with Medicare, Medicaid, private fully managed, and private partially managed insurance, the likelihood of utilization was higher in areas with higher HMO penetration. However, for those with other insurance or no insurance plan, the likelihood of utilization was lower in areas with higher HMO penetration.; CONCLUSIONS: Community-level enabling factors explain part of the effect of disadvantaged status but, with the exception of the effect of HMO penetration on the relationship between insurance and specialty care use, do not modify any of the residual individual-level effects of disadvantage. Interventions targeting both structural and individual levels may be necessary to address the problem of health disparities. More research with longitudinal data is necessary to sort out the causal direction of social context and ADM access outcomes, and whether policy interventions to change health sector market conditions can shift ADM treatment utilization.

AB BACKGROUND: Intravenous drug users (IDUs) are at increased risk of infective endocarditis (IE).; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Episodes of IE in IDUs were retrospectively analyzed in this multicenter study. Cases were collected between 1986 and 1999. Only definite diagnosis according to the Duke criteria were analyzed.; RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-three cases, including 100 cases in HIV-positive patients, were observed in IDUs. Any right-sided involvement was detected in 167 out of 263 cases (63.5%) and any left-sided involvement in 115 out of 263 cases (43.7%). The tricuspid valve (TV) alone was affected in 135 cases (51.3%), the mitral valve alone in 32 patients (12.1%), the aortic valve alone in 41 cases (15.6%) and the pulmonic valve alone in 3 cases. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 156 cases (59.3%) and Streptococcus spp. in 33 cases (12.5%). No major differences were observed between HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients. Any TV valve involvement was significantly associated with female rather than male gender (p = 0.02). There was a significant association between S. aureus etiology and TV involvement (p < 0.0001). The mortality rate was 16%. On multivariate analysis, only left-side IE (p = 0.0006; OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.0-13.5) and age greater than 35 years (p = 0.0068; OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.4-9.0) were independently associated with mortality.; CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis in IDUs is significantly associated with right-side localization (63.5% for any rightsided heart involvement vs 43.7% for any left-sided heart involvement; OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.55-3.23; p < 0.001). S. aureus is the microorganism most frequently isolated and is significantly associated with TV involvement. Any left-side involvement and age greater than 35 years are independently associated with mortality. HIV infection does not appear to have a significant effect on mortality.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the drinking and driving habits reported in people aged 21-34 years.; DESIGN: Random digit dialing survey.; SETTING: Seattle and Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon.; PARTICIPANTS: 917 individuals aged 21-34 years, who had a valid driver's license, who had consumed at least one alcoholic drink in the last year and who lived in Seattle, Spokane or Portland.; OUTCOME MEASURES: Driving after drinking, use of a designated driver and serving as a designated driver.; RESULTS: 62% drank alcohol at least weekly, and 31% binged at least once per month in the last year. 21% drove after drinking too much in the last month. Two-thirds of individuals reported being a designated driver at least once in the last year, and in most instances, this had been decided before the group went out for the evening. Over three-quarters of individuals reported that they drank less than they usually do the last time they were a designated driver. When using a designated driver, almost half of the individuals reported drinking more on that occasion than usual, with approximately half of those having at least three more drinks than usual.; CONCLUSIONS: These results point to the need for interventions to combat the problem of drunk driving and prevent its associated morbidity and mortality. Rigorous evaluation of the effect of designated driver and safe ride home programs are needed.

AB OBJECTIVES: Examine sources of alcohol over time in a large, ethnically diverse adolescent population from a poor, urban environment.; METHODS: Surveys were administered at four time points (6th-8th grades) assessing demographic characteristics, past year alcohol use and sources of alcohol to youth in Chicago, Illinois 2002-2005. Growth curve analysis was used to examine alcohol access trends among all alcohol using youth and consistent alcohol users. Interactions by race and gender were tested.; RESULTS: Social sources of alcohol were the most prevalent source over time. Parents were the primary source of alcohol, but their prominence significantly decreased over time. Taking alcohol from home, and getting alcohol from other adults, individuals under age 21, and commercial sources significantly increased as sources of alcohol over time. Males were significantly more likely than females to get alcohol from commercial sources and friends' parents.; CONCLUSIONS: Greater attention for reducing social access to alcohol, particularly among parents, is needed for alcohol prevention efforts prior to and during middle school.

AB Malt liquor (ML) is a cheap, high alcohol content beverage that is marketed to appeal to young adults. Findings from the few published studies of ML use suggest that it may be associated with excessive drinking, alcohol problems, and the use of illicit drugs. The authors conducted separate hierarchical multiple regressions to examine the role of ML use and psychosocial variables (e.g., personality, ML motives) in alcohol-related problems and marijuana use. Demographic characteristics served as controls. The sample consisted of 639 (456 men, 183 women) young adults (M = 22.9 years, SD = 4.2) who regularly (> or =40 oz/week) consumed ML. ML use significantly and positively predicted alcohol problems, ML-specific problems, and marijuana use, above and beyond their associations with typical alcohol use. Marijuana was the illicit drug of choice, and 46% reported concurrent use of marijuana and ML. Those who concurrently used ML and marijuana began drinking at a younger age and reported more substance use (particularly marijuana) and more alcohol-related problems than did non-concurrent users. These results suggest that ML use may represent a risk for alcohol problems and marijuana use.

AB PURPOSE: To determine whether early adolescents who are exposed to alcohol marketing are subsequently more likely to drink. Recent studies suggest that exposure to alcohol ads has a limited influence on drinking in mid-adolescence. Early adolescents may be more vulnerable to alcohol advertising effects.; METHODS: Two in-school surveys of 1786 South Dakota youth measured exposure to television beer advertisements, alcohol ads in magazines, in-store beer displays and beer concessions, radio-listening time, and ownership of beer promotional items during 6th grade, and drinking intentions and behavior at 7th grade. Multivariate regression equations predicted the two drinking outcomes using the advertising exposure variables and controlling for psychosocial factors and prior drinking.; RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, the joint effect of exposure to advertising from all six sources at grade 6 was strongly predictive of grade 7 drinking and grade 7 intentions to drink. Youth in the 75th percentile of alcohol marketing exposure had a predicted probability of drinking that was 50% greater than that of youth in the 25th percentile.; CONCLUSIONS: Although causal effects are uncertain, policy makers should consider limiting a variety of marketing practices that could contribute to drinking in early adolescence.

AB In the last years an extremely rapid massive diffusion of the cell phones is occurred. Currently in Italy, as in many other countries, almost all the youngsters and a lot of adults possess a cell phones. This device is enormously useful, but its use can determine negative effects on the user's attention, i.e. during vehicle driving. Numerous epidemiological studies show that cell phone use in driving determines a relative risk of causing a road accident around 4 (equivalent to driving with 0.8 g/l blood alcohol concentration), for both hands-held and hands-free devices. This risk doesn't seem well perceived from the Italian drivers: as our surveys show, the 2.5% of them use a cellular hands-held while driving. This situation appears to evolve toward more critical conditions, given the quick diffusion of ever more technologically advanced instruments, such as video-cell phones, mostly capable of capturing the attention, or TV-cell phones, with which the distracting occasions could be more frequent and prolonged. The use of the cell phone seems to imply an important risk for pedestrians: the first results of the monitoring results that we are producing on this matter in Rome show that the 5.5% of the pedestrians cross the road while talking with a hands-held cell phones, in the most of cases ignoring the traffic conditions at all. All this facts show the urgency to promote specific actions of prevention, in absence of which it is reasonable to foresee a consistent growth in the number of road traffic accidents. In our opinion it is necessary to capillarily inform the public of the signalled risks, possibly also in the advertising spaces of the producers and managers of the cellular telephony, apart obvious repressive actions on the use of the cell phones during the guide of a vehicle.

AB BACKGROUND: Craniometric variation in humans reflects different genetic and environmental influences. Long-term climatic adaptation is less likely to show an impact on size and shape variation in a small local area than at the global level.; AIM: The aim of this work was to assess the contribution of the particular environmental factors to body height and craniofacial variability in a small geographic area of Croatia.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 632 subjects, aged 18-21, participated in the survey. Body height, head length, head breadth, head height, head circumference, cephalic index, morphological face height, face breadth, and facial index were analysed regarding geographic, climatic and dietary conditions in different regions of the country, and correlated with the specific climatic variables (cumulative multiyear sunshine duration, cumulative multiyear average precipitation, multiyear average air temperatures) and calcium concentrations in drinking water. Significant differences between groups classified according to geographic, climatic or dietary affiliation, and the impact of the environmental predictors on the variation in the investigated traits were assessed using multiple forward stepwise regression analyses.; RESULTS: Higher body height measures in both sexes were significantly correlated with Mediterranean diet type. Mediterranean diet type also contributed to higher head length and head circumference measures in females. Cephalic index values correlated to geographic regions in both sexes, showing an increase from southern to eastern Croatia. In the same direction, head length significantly decreased in males and head breadth increased in females. Mediterranean climate was associated with higher and narrower faces in females. The analysis of the particular climatic variables did not reveal a significant influence on body height in either sex. Concurrently, climatic features influenced all craniofacial traits in females and only head length and facial index in males. Mediterranean climate, characterized by higher average sunshine duration, higher average precipitation and higher average air temperatures, was associated with longer, higher and narrower skulls, higher head circumference, lower cephalic index, and higher and narrower faces (lower facial index). Calcium concentrations in drinking water did not correlate significantly with any dependent variable.; CONCLUSION: A significant effect of environmental factors on body height and craniofacial variability was found in Croatian young adult population. This effect was more pronounced in females, revealing sex-specific craniofacial differentiation. However, the impact of environment was low and may explain only 1.0-7.32% variation of the investigated traits.

AB OBJECTIVE: To understand to the degree to which a broad variety of victimizations, including child maltreatment, conventional crime, peer, and sexual victimizations, persist for children from 1 year to the next.; DESIGN: A national sample of 1467 children aged 2-17 recruited through random digit dialing and assessed via telephone interviews (with caretakers and youth themselves) about a comprehensive range of victimization experiences in the previous year, and then re-assessed (72.3% of baseline sample) after a 1-year interval.; RESULTS: The risk for re-victimization in Year 2 was high for children victimized in Year 1, with risk ratios ranging from 2.2 for physical assault to 6.9 for sexual victimization. Victimization of any one type left substantial vulnerability even for different types of subsequent re-victimization (e.g., property crime victimization was associated with higher risk of sexual victimization the next year). Children with four or more types of victimization in Year 1 ("poly-victims") were at particularly high risk of persisting poly-victimization. Persisting poly-victimization was more likely for children who scored high on anger/aggression and who had recent life adversities. Desistence from poly-victimization was associated with having more good friends. Onset of poly-victimization in Year 2, in contrast to persistence from Year 1, was associated with violent or maltreating families, family problems such as alcohol abuse, imprisonment, unemployment and family disruption. Having more older siblings acted as both a risk factor and a protective factor for different groups of youth.; CONCLUSION: Children previously victimized in 1 year are at higher risk of continued victimization, and the poly-victims are at particular risk. These findings suggest the potential merit of identifying these high-risk children and making them priority targets for prevention efforts.

AB Research indicates that cannabis continues to be a popular illegal drug internationally. Furthermore, adolescent rates of use appear to be significant. Whilst the non-acute effect of cannabis use on adult cognition has been extensively researched, there has been less examination of adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the non-acute relationship between cannabis and cognitive function in a sample of adolescents with a continuum of cannabis use, taking into account additional predictor variables (psychiatric functioning, general functioning, demographics and other drug use). Seventy adolescents were recruited from clinical and community sources as well as through newspaper advertisements. After 12 hours abstinence from cannabis, adolescents completed a two-hour interview covering: demographics; alcohol and drug use history; drug use in the past 28 days; depression; further psychiatric functioning (including ADHD and Conduct Disorder); and cognitive functioning as measured by computerised tasks (CANTAB) and traditional pen and paper tests. Adolescents who were regular cannabis users (more than once a week) had a significantly poorer performance on four measures of cognitive function reflecting attention, spatial working memory and learning. Cannabis use remained an independent predictor of performance on the working memory and strategy measures after additional predictor variables were included in a multivariate regression analysis. The results suggest that aspects of adolescent cognitive function are independently related to the frequency of cannabis use beyond acute intoxication.

AB OBJECTIVE: To improve an early intervention (EI) triggered by the Adolescents' Substance Use Measurement (ADSUME) as a method to prevent substance abuse among adolescents. We assessed how ADSUME and EI work in practice and how EI could be improved.; DESIGN AND SAMPLE: School health nurses (n=10) tested ADSUME and EI on 14- to 18-year-old adolescents (n=228). Six months later, these nurses and their professional partners were invited to assess EI in focus group interviews.; METHODS: Four focus group interviews involving a total of 24 nurses and partners were implemented. Interview data were analyzed with qualitative content analysis.; RESULTS: ADSUME concretized assessment, activated profound dialogue, and proved to be an important part of EI. It was important to assess the adolescent's resources in addition to the ADSUME score. EI worked well in confidential dialogues after the adolescent and the PHN reached a consensus on the level of concern about the adolescent's substance use. The recommended EI enabled individual brief intervention in all four stages of substance use, from abstinence or experimental use to hazardous use.; CONCLUSIONS: EI was improved practically, and the contents of the intervention were reformulated. It is important to integrate EI with the preventive efforts of the school.

AB BACKGROUND: Identifying cannabis users who are most at risk of driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) has important implications for drug treatment and prevention efforts. This paper examined correlates of DUIC among a purposive sample of recent cannabis users.; METHODS: Interviews were carried out among a cross-sectional sample of 320 Australian cannabis users. Past-year prevalence of DUIC (without using alcohol or other drugs) was regressed against a range of potential predictor variables.; RESULTS: Use of multiple drugs, believing that DUIC does not increase accident risk and cannabis dependence all predicted likelihood of DUIC. There was an interaction between age of first cannabis use and gender, whereby earlier onset cannabis use predicted DUIC but only among women.; CONCLUSIONS: The correlates of drug driving reflected cannabis users' beliefs about the dangers of cannabis use as well as their patterns of drug consumption. The emergence of cannabis dependence and age of onset as predictors of DUIC suggests a clearly defined role for treatment and prevention efforts in reducing the potential harms associated with DUIC.

AB We examined data from a community sample of rural stimulant users (n = 691) in three diverse states to identify gender and racial/ethnic differences in HIV risk behaviors. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted with six risk behaviors as dependent variables: injecting drugs, trading sex to obtain money or drugs, trading money or drugs to obtain sex, inconsistent condom use, multiple sex partners, and using drugs with sex. Controlling for state, income, age, heavy drinking, and type of stimulant used, men had lower odds than women for trading sex to obtain money or drugs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =0.4, confidence interval [CI] = 0.28-0.59; p < .0001), greater odds than women for trading money or drugs to obtain sex (AOR = 44.4, CI = 20.30-97.09; p < .0001), greater odds than women of injecting drugs (adjusted odds ratio (AOR =1.6, CI = 1.11-2.42; p = .01), and lower odds than women of using condoms inconsistently (AOR = 0.6, CI = 0.35-0.92; p = .02); African Americans had lower odds than Whites of injecting drugs (AOR = .08, CI = 0.04-0.16; p < .0001), greater odds than Whites for trading sex to obtain money or drugs (AOR = 1.7, CI = 1.01-2.85; p = .04) and for trading money or drugs to obtain sex (AOR = 2.9, CI = 1.53-5.59; p = .001), and greater odds than Whites of using drugs with sex (AOR = 3.9, CI = 1.47-10.09; p = .006). These findings indicate HIV prevention efforts should be tailored to address gender and racial/ethnic differences in risk behaviors among rural stimulant users.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the community popular opinion leader (C-POL) intervention employed in the NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial, including its theoretical, conceptual, and empirical basis, intervention procedures and methods, core elements, and how its content was culturally tailored to address the needs of varied populations.; DESIGN: The programme is designed to identify, recruit, train, and intensively engage C-POLs of a target population to convey HIV risk reduction messages to people in their communities, with the intention of reducing high-risk behavior at a population level.; METHODS: Based on the diffusion of innovation theory, the intervention identified, trained, and engaged C-POL within a high-risk community population to advocate, recommend, and endorse the importance of safer behavior to other members of the same population. Nine core elements of the intervention are discussed. Data collected during rapid ethnography were used to adapt the content of the intervention for food market owners and workers in China, male patrons of wine shops and at-risk women congregating nearby in India, young people in social gathering venues in Peruvian barrios, dormitory students in Russia, and people congregating in commercial areas of growth points in Zimbabwe.; RESULTS: The C-POL intervention model taps into community strengths, altruism, and people's desire to do something to help fight against AIDS. With few exceptions, C-POLs participated enthusiastically in the training sessions and reported having conversations in the community.; CONCLUSION: Rapid ethnography can be used to tailor an intervention to diverse settings while maintaining fidelity to the core elements of the intervention.

AB That childhood obesity is an alarming public health problem is clear and widely appreciated. What is altogether unclear is what our society should do about it. Some people think the solution lies in using tort law to sue McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and other corporations. We reject that notion. Others believe that government should order specific changes in the behavior of food companies and school officials--and yet, there is little reason for confidence that these "command and control" strategies will make a difference. Instead, we propose "performance-based regulation" of the food industry. This is analogous to the approach our country is now taking with respect to elementary and secondary education (most prominently in the No Child Left Behind legislation). Schools are not told how to achieve better educational results, but better outcomes are demanded of them. This strategy has also been used in the environmental context to reduce harmful power plant emissions, and it has been briefly proposed as a way of regulating cigarette companies. In this Article, we propose that large firms selling food and drink that is high in sugar or fat will be assigned the responsibility of reducing obesity rates in a specific pool of children. A firm's share of the overall responsibility will be based on its share of the "bad' food market, and the children assigned to it will be organized by geographically proximate schools where obesity rates are currently above the plan's nationwide target rate of 8 percent (the actual childhood obesity rate today is approximately 16 percent). Firms that fail to achieve their goals will be subject to serious financial penalties.

AB This article describes the application and refinement of community-based prevention marketing (CBPM), an example of community-based participatory research that blends social marketing theories and techniques and community organization principles to guide voluntary health behavior change. The Florida Prevention Research Center has worked with a community coalition in Sarasota County, Florida to define locally important health problems and issues and to develop responsive health-promotion interventions. The CBPM framework has evolved as academic and community-based researchers have gained experience applying it. Community boards can use marketing principles to design evidence-based strategies for addressing local public health concerns. Based on 6 years of experience with the "Believe in All Your Possibilities" program, lessons learned that have led to revision and improvement of the CBPM framework are described.

AB International trade, population migration, changes in living conditions (i.e., consumption transition, nutritional transition), and changes in production, marketing, and availability of consumer goods (i.e., production transition) have brought about continuous and rapid changes in the human environment. Such changes have improved the health and economic status of many people in developing countries. At the same time, a parallel phenomenon is occurring: the rapid emergence and expansion of modifiable risk behaviors. These behaviors adversely affect the national health of developing countries and that of future generations because of their impact on maternal, child, and adolescent health. Furthermore, these behaviors are increasing at a faster rate than interventions to curb their growth are being implemented. We discuss the current status of five modifiable risk behaviors--alcohol consumption, tobacco use, overweight and obesity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, and physical inactivity--to emphasize the need for global advocacy and local action to enhance policy formulation and diffusion of interventions necessary to moderate the spread of these behaviors.

AB PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between truancy and the onset of drug use.; METHODS: Discrete time survival analysis was used to assess the effect of truancy on initiation of drug use after adjusting for several potential confounders from age 11 to 15 years, using data from the Denver Youth Survey, a longitudinal sample of youth who grew up in socially disorganized neighborhoods of Denver, CO.; RESULTS: In this population, truancy was a significant predictor of initiation of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. The robust effect of truancy persisted after controlling for potential confounders, including school performance, school isolation, association with delinquent peers, personal delinquent values, parental monitoring, and family attachment.; CONCLUSIONS: Although this study cannot point to a causal relationship, we argue that the effect may be at least in part due to the unsupervised, unmonitored time with peers that truancy affords a young person. Truancy prevention is a field of research that needs much more attention. Keeping youth in school every day is likely to have many beneficial effects, and effective truancy prevention efforts may also help to prevent or delay the onset of drug use among adolescents.

AB In contrast to many phenotypes that have been studied using twin designs, substance use shows considerable evidence of environmental influence. Accordingly, specifying the relevant environments and understanding the nature of their effects is an important research priority. Twin studies also have demonstrated that the importance of genetic and environmental influences varies across development for a variety of behavioral outcomes, including substance use. Here, we report analyses exploring moderating effects associated with parenting and peer characteristics on adolescent smoking and drinking, measured at ages 14 and 17. We find significant evidence of moderating effects associated with two dimensions of parenting (parental monitoring and time spent in activities with parents) on adolescent smoking, measured at two time points across development, but no moderating effects on adolescent drinking. Genetic influences on smoking increased, and common environmental effects decreased, as adolescents reported less parental monitoring and spending more time with their parents. Conversely, we find evidence that adolescent drinking is more strongly influenced by peer characteristics. The importance of genetic predispositions was increased among adolescents who reported more friends who used alcohol. These analyses illustrate the importance of incorporating measured aspects of the environment into genetically informative twin models to begin to understand how specific environments are related to various outcomes. Furthermore, they illustrate the importance of using a developmental perspective to understand how specific influences may vary across different ages, and across different phenotypes.

AB School discipline referrals (SDRs) may be useful in the early detection and monitoring of disruptive behavior problems to inform prevention efforts in the school setting, yet little is known about the nature and validity of SDRs in the early grades. For this descriptive study, SDR data were collected on a sample of first grade students who were at risk for developing disruptive behavior problems (n = 186) and a universal sample (n = 531) from 20 schools. Most SDRs were given for physical aggression and the predominant consequence was time out. As expected, boys and at-risk students were more likely to receive an SDR and to have more SDRs than were girls and the universal sample. A large difference between schools regarding the delivery of SDRs was found. A zero-inflated Poisson model clustered by school tested the prediction of school-level variables. Students in schools that had a systematic way of tracking SDRs were more likely to receive one. Also, schools with more low-income students and larger class sizes gave fewer SDRs. SDRs predicted teacher ratings, and to a lesser extent, parent ratings of disruptive behavior at the end of first grade. Practitioners and researchers must examine school-level influences whenever first grade discipline referrals are used to measure problem behavior for the purpose of planning and evaluating interventions.

AB BACKGROUND: Bacteraemia is still a major cause of case fatality in all age groups. Our aim was to identify the major underlying conditions constituting risk factors for case fatality in bacteraemia patients.; METHODS: The study involved 149 patients (79 male and 70 female) with bacteraemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (41 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Str. pneumoniae) (42 patients), beta-hemolytic streptococcae (beta-hml str.) (23 patients) and Eschericia coli (E. coli) (43 patients). Underlying diseases, alcohol and tobacco consumption and body mass index (BMI) were registered. Laboratory findings and clinical data were registered on admission and 6 consecutive days and on day 10-14. Case fatality was studied within 30 days after positive blood culture. Associations between underlying conditions and case fatality were studied in univariate analysis and in a multivariate model.; RESULTS: Nineteen patients (12.8%) died of bacteraemia. We found obesity (p = 0.002, RR 9.8; 95% CI 2.3 to 41.3), smoking (p < 0.001, RR 16.9; 95% CI 2.1 to 133.5), alcohol abuse (p = 0.008, RR 3.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 11.28), COPD (p = 0.01, RR 8.4; 95% CI 1.9 to 37.1) and rheumatoid arthritis (p = 0.045, RR 5.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 28.8) to be significantly associated with case fatality in bacteraemia in univariate model. The median BMI was significantly higher among those who died compared to survivors (33 vs. 26, p = 0.003). Obesity and smoking also remained independent risk factors for case fatality when their effect was studied together in a multivariate model adjusted with the effect of alcohol abuse, age (continuos variable), sex and causative organism.; CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that obesity and smoking are prominent risk factors for case fatality in bacteraemic patients. Identification of risk factors underlying fatal outcome in bacteraemia may allow targeting of preventive efforts to individuals likely to derive greatest potential benefit.

AB AIMS: To examine the genetic and environmental contributions to the initiation of use and progression to more serious use of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana during adolescence, and to examine the relationship between initiation and progression of substance use.; DESIGN: The study used a twin-based design and a new theoretical model, the causal-common-contingent (CCC) model. This allows modelling of the relationship between initiation of use and progression to heavier use as a two-stage model and the examination of genetic and environmental influences on both stages, while taking into account their relationship.; PARTICIPANTS: The participants consisted of 1214 twin pairs (69% response rate) aged 11-19 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET).; MEASUREMENTS: Data on adolescent initiation and progression to more serious use of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana were obtained using self-report questionnaires.; FINDINGS: Initiation of alcohol and progression to heavier alcohol use had separate but related underlying aetiologies. For cigarette and marijuana use the relation between initiation and progression to heavier use was stronger, suggesting greater overlap in aetiologies. For all three substances, environmental influences that make twins more similar (common environment) tended to be greater for initiation, while genetic influences were stronger for heavier use.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for policy decisions aimed at an adolescent and early adult age group. Specifically, these findings suggest that it may be more efficacious to focus alcohol interventions on risk factors for the development of heavier use rather than initiation of use. In contrast, interventions aimed at reducing the initiation of cigarettes and marijuana use may be more appropriate.

AB Alcohol consumption typically takes place in a time-out situation, which can be spent by engaging in several leisure time activities. Usually, conversation is the dominant pastime in a bar, but this may take place during other activities, like watching TV or playing games. These activities may inhibit drinking because of the physical difficulties of drinking and being active at the same time. Findings of an observational study on drinking in young adults (N=238) in a bar lab will be discussed. In the present study, we followed the ad-lib drinking of peer groups (7-9 persons) during 1-h periods. The results suggest that (1) selection of activities is not related to initial drinking level or personality characteristics; (2) active pastime is related to slower drinking than passive pastime (in males); (3) male problem drinkers appear to compensate for the "lost" amount of drinking after an active phase; and (4) involvement in active pastime is not related to total alcohol consumption. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB AIM: This paper describes adolescents' exposure to alcohol advertising in stores and to alcohol-branded promotional items and their association with self-reported drinking.; METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered in non-tracked required courses to sixth, seventh, and eighth graders (n = 2125) in three California middle schools. Logistic regressions compared the odds of ever (vs. never) drinking and current (vs. ever) drinking after controlling for psychosocial and other risk factors for adolescent alcohol use.; RESULTS: Two-thirds of middle school students reported at least weekly visits to liquor, convenience, or small grocery stores where alcohol advertising is widespread. Such exposure was associated with higher odds of ever drinking, but was not associated with current drinking. One-fifth of students reported owning at least one alcohol promotional item. These students were three times more likely to have ever tried drinking and 1.5 times more likely to report current drinking than students without such items.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clear evidence of an association of adolescent drinking with weekly exposure to alcohol advertising in stores and with ownership of alcohol promotional items. Given their potential influence on adolescent drinking behaviour, retail ads, and promotional items for alcohol deserve further study.

AB BACKGROUND: Alcohol advertising is a powerful factor of incitation to consumption. We analyzed the alcohol advertising, especially that youth-focused, in written mass media in Spain during the period 2002-2006.; METHODS: Annual cross-sectional study of advertisements in 41 widely difused written mass media (average readers: 10,1 millions).; RESULTS: Media admitting alcohol publicity were 29% in the whole. (2,9 millions of readers on average, 29% of total readers). Alcohol advertising constituted the 3,8% of global publicity and the 8,6% of the publicity in media admitting alcohol publicity. In this period only 4% of the media (2,4% of total readers) inserted antidrug campaigns. In brief, three out of 10 total readers and one out of 12 people older than 15 years suffered the impact of tobacco advertising. Young people were included in 33% of alcohol advertisements and 3 out of 6 of youth-oriented magazines permitted a such publicity.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol publicity remains high in written mass media in Spain. By contrast few people received informative antidrug campaigns. Advertising was preferentially directed to young people.

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of knowledge relating to UK 'Sensible Drinking' guidelines, definitions of binge drinking and attitude to drink labelling initiatives amongst female school leavers enrolling at university.; METHODS: Non-standardized questionnaires were administered and completed by researchers during the process of matriculation (response rate 94%; n = 180).; RESULTS: The survey revealed that recommended daily guidelines for women were not recalled by 54% of participants; 52% could not quote the unit content of their favoured alcoholic drink, whereas only 14% reported the use of the UK unit system to guide drinking. Personal quantitative definitions of binge drinking varied by a factor of 18.; CONCLUSION: A rewording of the UK Sensible Drinking message to one recognizing the needs of different population groups and their particular language of consumption measure is timely.

AB Shooting galleries (SGs) are illicit off-street spaces close to drug markets used for drug injection. Supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) are low threshold health services where injecting drug users (IDUs) can inject pre-obtained drugs under supervision. This study describes SG use in Kings Cross, Sydney before and after the opening of the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), Australia's first SIF. Operational and environmental characteristics of SGs, reasons for SG use, and willingness to use MSIC were also examined. An exploratory survey of SG users (n = 31), interviews with SG users (n = 17), and drug workers (n = 8), and counts of used needles routinely collected from SGs (6 months before and after MSIC) and visits to the MSIC (6 months after MSIC) were triangulated. We found five SGs operated during the study period. Key operational characteristics were 24-h operation, AUS $10 entry fee, 30-min time limit, and dual use for sex work. Key reasons for SG use were to avoid police, a preference not to inject in public, and assistance from SG operators in case of overdose. SG users reported high levels of willingness to use the MSIC. The number of used needles collected from SGs decreased by 69% (41,819 vs. 12,935) in the 6 months after MSIC opened, while MSIC visits increased incrementally. We conclude that injections were transferred from SGs to the MSIC, but SGs continued to accommodate injections and harm reduction outreach should be maintained.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examines relationships between multiple aspects of the home food environment and obesity-promoting characteristics of 12- to 13-year-old adolescents' diets, specifically frequency of consumption of high-energy fluids, sweet snacks, savory snacks, and take-out foods.; RESEARCH METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including 347 adolescents 12 to 13 years of age and their parents. Data were collected via self-completed surveys. The adolescents' diets were assessed using a Food Frequency Questionnaire derived from existing age-appropriate National Nutrition Survey data. An extensive range of domains within the home food environment were assessed. Bivariate linear regression analyses were run split by gender. Forced entry multiple linear regression analyses (adjusting for all variables significant in bivariate analyses as well as for maternal education) were also performed, stratified by the sex of the child.; RESULTS: The influence of mothers, either as models for eating behaviors or as the providers of food, was pervasive. Mothers' intake of high-energy fluids (p = 0.003), sweet snacks (p = 0.010), savory snacks (p = 0.008), and take-out food (p = 0.007) was positively associated with boys' intake of all these foods. In addition, mothers' intake of high-energy fluids was positively associated with daughters' consumption of these drinks (p = 0.025). Furthermore, availability of unhealthy foods at home was positively associated with girls' sweet snack (p = 0.001), girls' savory snack (p < 0.001), boys' savory snack (p = 0.002), and, in the bivariate analyses, girls' high-energy fluid consumption (p = 0.002).; DISCUSSION: This study of home food environment influences on adolescent diet highlights the pervasive influence of mothers in determining adolescents' obesity-promoting eating, providing direction for obesity prevention strategies and future research.

AB OBJECTIVE: Prescription drug diversion involves the unlawful channeling of regulated pharmaceuticals from legal sources to the illicit marketplace, and can occur along all points in the drug delivery process, from the original manufacturing site to the wholesale distributor, the physician's office, the retail pharmacy, or the patient. However, empirical data on diversion are limited.; METHOD: In an attempt to develop a better understanding of how specific drug-using populations are diverting prescription opioids and other medications, or obtaining controlled drugs that have already been diverted, qualitative interviews and focus group data were collected on four separate populations of prescription drug abusers in Miami, Florida--club drug users, street-based illicit drug users, methadone maintenance patients, and HIV positive individuals who abuse and/or divert drugs.; RESULTS: Sources of abused prescription drugs cited by focus group participants were extremely diverse, including their physicians and pharmacists; parents and relatives; "doctor shopping"; leftover supplies following an illness or injury; personal visits to Mexico, South America and the Caribbean; prescriptions intended for the treatment of mental illness; direct sales on the street and in nightclubs; pharmacy and hospital theft; through friends or acquaintances; under-the-door apartment flyers advertising telephone numbers to call; and "stealing from grandma's medicine cabinet."; CONCLUSION: While doctor shoppers, physicians and the Internet receive much of the attention regarding diversion, the data reported in this paper suggest that there are numerous active street markets involving patients, Medicaid recipients and pharmacies as well. In addition, there are other data which suggest that the contributions of residential burglaries, pharmacy robberies and thefts, and "sneak thefts" to the diversion problem may be understated.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine the hazard exposures, work experiences, and workplace safety training of adolescents employed in retail and service jobs in the United States.; METHODS: This was a cross-sectional telephone survey among working adolescents, 14 to 18 years old, in the continental United States. Data were collected in 2003. Survey items measured self-reported hazard exposures, training, and supervision experiences of working adolescents.; RESULTS: Teens reported working an average of 16.2 hours per week during the school year, including working an average of 2.9 times per week after 7 PM on school nights and 2.6 nights per week after 9 PM. Thirty-seven percent of those under age 16 reported working after 7 PM on a school night, indicating employer violation of federal law. Teens typically perform multiple kinds of tasks in a given job. Higher proportions of females than males are involved in cash handling (84% vs 61%), whereas males are more likely than females to be involved in physically challenging tasks, such as lifting heavy objects (57% vs 22%) or working at heights (35% vs 17%). Despite federal regulations prohibiting teens under 18 from using certain types of dangerous equipment (eg, slicers, dough mixers, box crushers, paper balers) or serving or selling alcohol in places where it is consumed, 52% of males and 43% of females reported having performed > or = 1 prohibited task. Although more males reported receiving safety training, they were also more likely to report working without supervision than their female counterparts.; CONCLUSIONS: Teens are exposed to multiple hazards, use dangerous equipment despite federal prohibitions, and work long hours during the school week. They also lack consistent training and adult supervision on the job. It is important for adolescent medicine practitioners to become involved in prevention efforts through both anticipatory guidance and policy advocacy.

AB The American Academy of Pediatrics continues to believe that adolescents should not be drug tested without their knowledge and consent. Recent US Supreme Court decisions and market forces have resulted in recommendations for drug testing of adolescents at school and products for parents to use to test adolescents at home. The American Academy of Pediatrics has strong reservations about testing adolescents at school or at home and believes that more research is needed on both safety and efficacy before school-based testing programs are implemented. The American Academy of Pediatrics also believes that more adolescent-specific substance abuse treatment resources are needed to ensure that testing leads to early rehabilitation rather than to punitive measures only.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare overweight and obesity, eating habits and life style among adolescents from different economic levels.; METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken with 588 adolescents from a public and a private school in Campina Grande, PB. They belonged to economic levels A(1), A(2) and B(1)(292) and C, D and E (296), according to the Brazilian Criteria of Economic Classification of the Brazilian Association of Research Iistitutes. Height and body weight were measured and Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated; >or= p85 = overweight and >or= p95 = obesity. A questionnaire for assessment of leisure time, physical activity, time spent watching TV and eating habits was administered.; RESULTS: Overweight and obesity were more common in the higher economic level than in the lower economic one; 31.4% versus 18.1% ; p < 0.001. Leisure time for physical activity was more present in adolescents with A(1), A(2) e B(1) economic status. Watching TVdisclosed no difference between the two economic levels surveyed. Daily consumption of softs drinks, sweets and salty snacks were more common in the higher economic level but this was not associated with obesity. A low consumption of fruits was observed in all economic levels.; CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity are frequent among adolescents of Campina Grande, PB, as well as time spent watching TV and unhealthy eating habits, especially among those of the higher economic level.. The amount of time spent on leisure for physical activities was low, especially in the lower economic level.

AB Compulsive buying disorder is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled preoccupations, urges, or behaviors regarding shopping and spending that lead to subjective distress or impaired functioning. Compulsive buying disorder is estimated to have a lifetime prevalence of 5.8% in the United States general adult population. In clinical settings, most individuals with compulsive buying disorder are women (approximately 80%). This gender difference may be artifactual. Compulsive buying disorder is typically chronic or intermittent, with an age of onset in the late teens or early 20s. Comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, and other disorders of impulse control are common, as are Axis II disorders. The disorder occurs worldwide, mainly in developed countries with market-based economies, and it tends to run in families with mood disorders and substance abuse. There is no standard treatment for compulsive buying disorder, but group cognitive-behavioral models seem promising, and psychopharmacologic treatments are being actively studied. Other treatment options include simplicity circles, 12-step programs, financial counseling, bibliotherapy, marital therapy, and financial counseling. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature of sexual activity and risk-taking behaviors among Asian-American youth.; DESIGN: Literature review of sexual activity, alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use among Asian-American adolescents.; RESULTS: Asian-Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the United States. Asian-American adolescents report lower involvement with sexual activity than all other racial/ethnic peer groups. Once initiated, however, Asian-American adolescents have sexual behavior patterns comparable to other adolescent groups. In general, Asian-Americans have low rates of alcohol and tobacco usage and the males have higher use rates than the females. Degree of acculturation in the United States appears to be associated with risk-taking behavior. Asian-American adolescents also initiate smoking later than other groups. Although drug use among Asian-American adolescents is historically low, there appears to be variability on the level of illicit drug use among certain Asian-American adolescent subgroups.; CONCLUSION: Clinicians should focus prevention efforts and education on the Asian-American groups associated with higher risk-taking behaviors, particularly males and those who are more acculturated. Furthermore, to benefit Asian-American youth, anti-smoking education should continue through high school and early adulthood.

AB In several national surveys a younger age of substance usage has been associated with a higher likelihood of the development of dependence. Some studies have suggested that age at first use is primarily an environmentally driven variable, whereas others suggest that it may be partially mediated by a general vulnerability to exhibit problem behaviors. Although Native Americans, overall, have the highest prevalence of substance dependence of any US ethnic group, the relationship of age of first marijuana use on the development of dependence in Native American populations is relatively unknown. Demographic information and DSM-III-R diagnoses were obtained from 525 Southwest California Indian adults residing on contiguous reservations. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between age of first use and marijuana use disorders. Early marijuana use was found to be strongly associated with abuse and dependence in this population, even in the presence of several other risk factors including externalizing diagnoses. These data suggest that effective environmental prevention efforts at reducing early marijuana use may be an important strategy to lower the prevalence of use disorders in this high risk population.

AB We enrolled more than 3500 same-sex twinsfrom 5 consecutive Finnish birth cohorts into a longitudinal study as each cohort reached age 16. Twins completed the Psychopathic Deviate (Pd) Scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory at baseline, Sensation Seeking Scale items as each cohort reached age 17, and later, at average ages 18.5 and 25, the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI). Using raw maximum likelihood estimation, we fit a Cholesky model to the 4 variables assessed at 4 ages across the 4 twin types; we estimated genetic and environmental influences on the stability of alcohol problems across development and the genetic and environmental contributions to predictive correlations between adolescent personality and later alcohol-related behavior problems. With one exception, the phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations were very similar for males and females. The exception was that the lagged associations of Pd and RAPI reflect a higher genetic correlation among males than females and a higher environmental correlation among females than males. Our analyses suggest that developmental changes underlying variation in alcohol problems from late adolescence to early adulthood differ for males and females. In males, the main change is decreased variation due to shared environmental effects; the magnitude of genetic effects is stable over time, and the high genetic correlation, .95, suggests that the same genetic influences are important at both ages. Among females, in contrast, genetic influences decline in magnitude from age 18 to 25, and at least part of the genetic effect evident at age 25 differs from the genetic effect evident at age 18.

AB To obtain a better understanding of how genetic and environmental processes are involved in the stability and change in problem behavior from early adolescence into adulthood, studies with genetically informative samples are important. The present study used parent-reported data on internalizing and externalizing problem behavior of adoptees at mean ages 12.4, 15.5 and 26.3. In this adoption study adopted biologically related sibling pairs shared on average 50% of their genes and were brought up in the same family environment, whereas adopted biologically unrelated sibling pairs only shared their family environment. The resemblance between these adopted biologically related (N = 106) and unrelated sibling pairs (N=230) was compared and examined over time. We aimed to investigate (1) to what extent are internalizing and externalizing problem behavior stable from early adolescence into adulthood, and (2) whether the same or different genetic and environmental factors affect these problem behaviors at the 3 assessments. Our results show that both internalizing (rs ranging from .34 to .58) and externalizing behavior (rs ranging from .47 to .69) were rather stable over time. For internalizing and externalizing problem behavior it was found that both genetic and shared environmental influences could be modeled by an underlying common factor, which explained variance in problem behavior from early adolescence into adulthood and accounted for stability over time. The nonshared environmental influences were best modeled by a Cholesky decomposition for internalizing behavior, whereas a time-specific influence of the nonshared environment was included in the final model of externalizing behavior.

AB BACKGROUND: To examine the extent and nature of alcohol imagery on New Zealand (NZ) television, a content analysis of 98 hours of prime-time television programs and advertising was carried out over 7 consecutive days' viewing in June/July 2004. The main outcome measures were number of scenes in programs, trailers and advertisements depicting alcohol imagery; the extent of critical versus neutral and promotional imagery; and the mean number of scenes with alcohol per hour, and characteristics of scenes in which alcohol featured.; RESULTS: There were 648 separate depictions of alcohol imagery across the week, with an average of one scene every nine minutes. Scenes depicting uncritical imagery outnumbered scenes showing possible adverse health consequences of drinking by 12 to 1.; CONCLUSION: The evidence points to a large amount of alcohol imagery incidental to storylines in programming on NZ television. Alcohol is also used in many advertisements to market non-alcohol goods and services. More attention needs to be paid to the extent of alcohol imagery on television from the industry, the government and public health practitioners. Health education with young people could raise critical awareness of the way alcohol imagery is presented on television.

AB Countless barriers come between people who are struggling with substance abuse and those charged with providing substance abuse treatment. The check-up, a form of motivational enhancement therapy, is a harm reduction intervention that offers a manner of supporting individuals by lowering specific barriers to reaching those who are untreated. The check-up was originally developed to reach problem drinkers who were neither seeking treatment nor self-initiating change. The intervention, marketed as an opportunity to take stock of one's experiences, involves an assessment and personalized feedback delivered with a counseling style termed motivational interviewing. Check-ups can be offered in care settings to individuals who, as a result of screening, manifest risk factors for specific disorders such as alcoholism. They can also be free-standing and publicized widely to the general public. This paper will discuss illustrations of in-person, computerized, in-school, and telephone applications of the free-standing type of check-up with reference to alcohol consumers, adult and adolescent marijuana smokers, and gay/bisexual males at risk for sexual transmission of HIV. The paper's major focus is to highlight how unique features of each application have the potential of reducing barriers to reaching specific at-risk populations. Also considered are key policy issues such as how check-up services can be funded, which venues are appropriate for the delivery of check-up interventions, pertinent competency criteria in evaluating staff who deliver this intervention, how marketing can be designed to reach contemplators in untreated at-risk populations, and how a check-up's success ought to be defined.

AB Early-onset or frequent substance use during adolescence increases the risk of developing mental health problems, as well as a range of other adverse outcomes (eg, alcohol or drug dependence, educational underachievement, health problems, social difficulties) during late adolescence and early adulthood. Increases in rates of risky drinking among young people are particularly concerning, suggesting that an effective, evidence-based alcohol policy and preventive framework needs to be developed. Restricting the supply of licit and illicit substances to adolescents, delaying the age that licit substances can be legally purchased, reducing positive media portrayals of substance use, and banning targeted promotions, should be universal, public prevention priorities. Mass-media campaigns need to deliver coherent and credible evidence-based messages to young people, utilising a broad array of dissemination strategies. Clear policy and guidelines for parents regarding appropriate alcohol use for adolescents also need to be developed. Prevention programs should target children and adolescents in families with parents who use drugs, young people who have been suspended from school, or those with mental health problems. Preventive screening and targeted brief interventions can be effectively delivered in a variety of settings by a range of health professionals.

AB Considerable research has focused on patterns of substance use initiation among adolescents and for users of selected drugs; however, few data are available for methamphetamine (MA) users. This study describes substance initiation patterns for 352 MA users and assesses predictors of age of MA initiation and its sequencing. Subjects were randomly selected from treatment admissions in a large California county and interviewed using an extensive natural history protocol. Average age of MA initiation was 19 years. Nearly all (95%) had used alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco (average initiation age 13); inhalants, hallucinogens, and crack were also commonly used earlier in the drug sequence than MA. Earlier age of MA initiation was related to race/ethnicity (being non-African-American), younger age of first use of any substance, more types of early criminal behavior, and initiating MA use for sensation-seeking reasons. Following initiation of alcohol, marijuana, and/or tobacco, 27% initiated MA before other illicit drugs, 18% initiated another illicit drug before MA, and 56% initiated two or more other illicit drugs before MA. Later MA order in the initiation sequence was related to ethnicity (being African-American) and initiating MA to substitute for another drug. Results may support targeted prevention efforts and development of more effective interventions.

Using snowball sampling techniques, 813 African American active IDUs were recruited for semi-structured interviewing and HIV counseling, testing and partner notification. Logistic regression examined the relationship between level of education attained (three categories: less than high school; equivalent to high school; and greater than high school) and HIV risk behaviors (12 unsafe sex and drug-related practices) and HIV serostatus (positive or negative). Compared with the reference category (less than high school education), those with education equal to high school were less likely to share water, p = 0.044, OR = 0.70 (95%CI: 0.50-0.99). Compared with the reference category, those with education greater than high school were less likely to receive money for sex, p = 0.048, OR = 0.62 (95%CI: 0.38-0.99); share needles with person having HIV or AIDS, p = 0.015, OR = 0.58 (95%CI: 0.37-0.90); and test positive for HIV, p = 0.027, OR = 0.58 (95%CI: 0.36-0.94). The significant associations found between educational attainment and certain HIV risk behaviors and HIV serostatus have implications for tailoring HIV prevention efforts for less educated African American IDUs.

We calculated weighted prevalence rates of lifetime and past-year psychiatric disorders across different sociodemographic, ethnic, and immigration groups.; RESULTS: Lifetime psychiatric disorder prevalence estimates were 28.1% for men and 30.2% for women. Puerto Ricans had the highest overall prevalence rate among the Latino ethnic groups assessed. Increased rates of psychiatric disorders were observed among US-born, English-language-proficient, and third-generation Latinos.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide important information about potential correlates of psychiatric problems among Latinos that can inform clinical practice and guide program development. Stressors associated with cultural transmutation may exert particular pressure on Latino men. Continued attention to environmental influences, especially among third-generation Latinos, is an important area for substance abuse program development.

A sample of 2,051 children (age 14-39 years) of 1,045 twins was used to estimate the genetic and environmental influences on marital conflict and determine whether genetic or environmental selection processes underlie the observed association between marital conflict and conduct problems. Results indicate that genetic and nonshared environmental factors influence the risk of marital conflict. Furthermore, genetic influences mediated the association between marital conflict frequency and conduct problems. These results highlight the need for quasiexperimental designs in investigations of intergenerational associations.

The identified items were coded against 28 measures constructed to assess the content of the items against the five sections of the ABAC. Two thirds of the magazines contained at least one alcohol advertisement or promotion with a total of 142 unique items identified: 80 were brand advertisements and 62 were other types of promotional items (i.e. sales promotions, event sponsorships, cross promotions with other marketers and advertorials). It was found that 52% of items appeared to contravene at least one section of the ABAC. The two major apparent breaches related to section B--the items having a strong appeal to adolescents (34%) and to section C--promoting positive social, sexual and psychological expectancies of consumption (28%). It was also found that promotional items appeared to breach the ABAC as often as did advertisements. It is concluded that the self-regulating system appears not to be working for the alcoholic beverages industry in Australia and that increased government surveillance and regulation should be considered, giving particular emphasis to the inclusion of promotional items other than brand advertising.

AB Suicide is a serious health problem as it is currently the third leading cause of death for teenagers between the ages of 15 and 24 years. Depression, which is also a serious problem for adolescents, is the most significant biological and psychological risk factor for teen suicide. Alcohol use remains extremely widespread among today's teenagers and is related to both suicidality and depression. Suicidality refers to the occurrence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior. The consensus in empirical research is that mental disorders and substance abuse are the most important risk factors in both attempted and completed adolescent suicide. Therefore, it is incumbent upon researchers to identify the factors that can lead to their prevention among today's youth. This review compiles the existing literature on suicidality, depression, and alcohol use among adolescents spanning over the past 15 years. Both Problem Behavior Theory and Stress-coping Theory can explain the relationships among suicidality, depression and alcohol use. The prevention of suicidality is critical, especially during the early school years, when it is associated with depression and alcohol use. Suicidality, depression and alcohol use are three phenomenon that noticeably increase in adolescence marking this time period as an ideal opportunity for prevention efforts to commence. Future empirical work is needed that will further assess the impact of adolescent depression and alcohol use on suicidality. In sum, this review of empirical research highlights critical results and limitations, as well as indicates a need for continued efforts in preventing suicidality, depression, and alcohol use among adolescents.

AB Adolescent suicide is an escalating crisis that needs to be addressed by clinicians and researchers. Alcohol use has consistently been implicated in adolescent suicide and it is generally assumed that alcohol use leads to an increased risk in suicidality, suicide attempts and completed suicides. It can lead to adolescent suicidality through alcohol myopia, disinhibition, and impaired judgment. Multiple genetically related intermediate phenotypes might contribute to the risk of alcohol misuse and suicidal behavior in adolescents. Genetic variations that enhance the risk for mood and anxiety symptoms or susceptibility to stress might increase risk through different mechanisms. Comorbid disorders such as depression are frequently exhibited in adolescents who misuse alcohol, therefore any adolescent who appears to be at risk for alcoholism or depression should always be screened for all other psychiatric disorders and for suicidality; some signs suicidal adolescents may exhibit include withdrawal, personality change, and a loss of interest in pleasurable activities. While assessment is important, prevention is crucial in any attempt to decrease the incidence of adolescent suicide. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established a set of seven guidelines that can be implemented from kindergarten through high school in order to establish alcohol prevention efforts in schools. Through beginning prevention efforts at a young age, it is hopeful that both alcohol misuse and adolescent suicide can be reduced.

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe how nutrition behaviours and physical activity are associated with body mass index (BMI) among New Zealand children and to determine if these relationships vary by ethnicity.; METHODS: Data were collected during the 2002 National Children's Nutrition Survey. 3250 children provided information about their eating and activity behaviours and anthropometric measurements.; RESULTS: Approximately 31% of New Zealand children aged 5 to 14 years were overweight/obese, with the highest prevalences of overweight/obesity among Pacific children (62%) and Maori children (41%). Higher prevalences of obesity were also observed among females and children experiencing socioeconomic deprivation. Television use, buying school food from the dairy/takeaway shops, skipping breakfast, consumption of fruit drinks/soft drinks, and low physical activity were associated with BMI in analyses controlling for demographic characteristics among the total population. Buying school food from the dairy/takeaway (p=0.04) and skipping breakfast (p=0.007) retained significance when all nutrition behaviours and physical activity were analysed simultaneously. Significant interactions between ethnicity and bringing school food from home and buying school food from school were observed in relation to BMI. In most cases, the relationships were most significant for Pacific children.; CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to address childhood obesity among all New Zealand children should primarily include efforts to increase breakfast consumption and decrease food purchases away from home. Given the high rates of obesity between Pacific and Maori children, targeted interventions are warranted and should include strategies to improve the school food environment.

AB Increase in extramarital sex among youths, gender-based violence, lack of contraceptive knowledge among newly married couples and lack of knowledge of protection against diseases like STIs/HIV are the information and service needs of young people that need to be addressed urgently in order to make them future knowledgeable, responsible, and non-violent partners. In addressing these needs the gatekeepers, including parents, formal and informal community leaders and teachers, play a critical role, by facilitating/hindering access to appropriate and correct information about sexual and reproductive health to young people. The study was conducted in a district of Uttaranchal, India. The specific objective was to understand the social context and gatekeepers' views on family planning and sexual and reproductive health needs of young men. Thirty-two in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted with parents, formal and informal community leaders, teachers, and selected development officials. The findings indicate that gatekeepers are worried about rapid changes in the aspiration, expectation, and behavior of young men. Most of them were seriously concerned about the increasing drinking habit, use of drugs, and changing values of sexuality leading to various risk behaviors among young men. They felt that many of these changes are consequences of wider societal changes, rising aspirations, explosion of electronic media, and globalization of a new youth culture where extramarital sex, alcohol consumption, and violence are expressions of different facets of masculinity and symbols of the affluent class. Overall, there was a feeling that TV/films and their peers now influence more the socialization of young people and parents are losing control in guidance and mentoring of their children.

AB There is an observed increasing trend of substance use among the adolescents and young adults. One of the important aetiologies is "modeling" especially from popular artists portraying their use to the viewing public over the electronic media. Indigenous films on video tapes acted in English or "Yoruba" (a popular Nigerian language) were randomly selected from various retail outlets in Lagos for viewing. The settings were the Ikorodu and Ipaja suburbs of Lagos. The viewing audience in each center was made up of a researcher and two adolescent secondary school students. They were to make notes on each film with scenes of substance use, type, and nature of use. A total of 479 video tapes were studied over a 6 month period, of which 268 (55.9%) contained scenes portraying the use of one or more substances. Two hundred forty-seven (51.6%, N = 479) depicted the use of only one type of substance and the rest, 21 (4.3%, N = 479), portrayed the use of multiple substances. The commonest substance portrayed to be used was alcohol, 197 (41.1%, N = 479), followed by tobacco, 81 (16.9%, N = 479). Cannabis was shown to be used in only 3 (0.6%, N = 479); Cocaine and Heroin in 8 (1.6%, N = 479) of the films. There was no statistically significant difference on substance use portrayal between the home movies acted in English and Yoruba (chi2 = 32.8; df = 7 at p > or = 0.05). A significant number of films on video tapes in Nigeria portrayed substance use which could act as triggers or reinforcement for substance use among the viewing audience, especially adolescents and young adults. The need to censor video tapes on substance use portrayal was advocated.

These prevention efforts aimed at youth include programming in the non-school hours. To examine the relationship between these efforts and youth substance abuse, students indicating participation in one or more prevention activities were compared to non-participant students. Results revealed that participating middle school students were less likely to have reported use of tobacco than their non-participating peers. Also, participation in prevention activities in the non-school hours was related to a lower likelihood of alcohol use among high school students.

AB Over the past decade, the misuse and abuse of opioid medications in the United States has risen dramatically. Although data show a substantial variation in the nonmedical use of individual opioids, relatively little is known about risk factors for the nonmedical use of specific opioid products. This study compared the prevalence and correlates of the nonmedical use of oral immediate-release hydromorphone (marketed under the brand name of Dilaudid), versus that of hydrocodone combination products using a nationally representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized United States population aged 12 years or older. Data were from the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. An estimated 31.3 million individuals reported lifetime nonmedical use of an opioid analgesic. Of these, 2.9 percent reported lifetime nonmedical use of Dilaudid, and 51.9 percent reported lifetime nonmedical use of hydrocodone combination products exclusive of nonmedical Dilaudid use. Nonmedical Dilaudid users were likely to be older, Caucasian, and to have reported a higher lifetime prevalence of heroin, cocaine and injection drug use, as well as nonmedical use of other opioids. Nonmedical Dilaudid users were at higher risk for engaging in more serious substance abuse-related behaviors than those who reported lifetime nonmedical use of hydrocodone combination products.

AB INTRODUCTION: The crash risk of teens is high, with fatal crash rates of teen drivers higher than any other age group. New approaches to reduce teen traffic fatalities are clearly needed.; METHOD: A possible approach to reduce the incidence of teen driver crashes and fatalities is through the use of vehicle-based intelligent driver support systems. To be most effective, the system should address the behaviors associated with an overwhelming number of teen fatal crashes: speed, low seatbelt use, and alcohol impairment. In-vehicle technology also offers an opportunity to address the issue of inexperience through enforcement of certain Graduated Driver's License provisions.; RESULTS: To fully understand the capability of such technologies, there should be a concerted effort to further their development, and human factors testing should take place to understand their effects on the driver.; IMPACT: If successfully implemented, a Teen Driver Support System (TDSS), such as the one described here, could significantly decrease the number of teens killed in traffic crashes.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify developmental trajectories of problem drinking from adolescence into young adulthood and to determine if alcohol use initiation experiences and family history of alcoholism, as well as their interactions, would predict trajectory group membership.; METHOD: Five waves of data were collected from respondents who were 12 years old at the time of recruitment to the Rutgers Health and Human Development Project and followed until age 31 (n = 438). A standardized measure of problem drinking (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index) was used to develop trajectories with growth-mixture modeling. Differences across groups in first- use experience (age of onset, pleasantness of the experience, and feeling intoxicated), a family history of alcoholism, and gender were analyzed with chi-square and analysis of variance tests, and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds of group membership.; RESULTS: Three trajectory groups of drinkers were identified: no or low problem (66.2%), adolescence-limited problem (ALP; 21.6%), and escalating problem (EP; 12.1%) drinkers. Age at drinking onset, feeling drunk during the first alcohol experience, and family history of alcoholism were associated with significantly greater odds of being in a problem trajectory group relative to the no or low problem trajectory. Early experiences did not differentiate the ALP and EP trajectories. None of the interactions was significantly associated with membership in any of the groups.; CONCLUSIONS: The levels and patterns of problem drinking during early to mid-adolescence point to a need for secondary prevention efforts that target problematic users in addition to the current emphasis on primary prevention of alcohol consumption. Prevention-based research may benefit from special focus on the meaning and consequences of self-perception of drunkenness when alcohol is first used.

AB OBJECTIVE: Study the incidence of drug abuse in persons with unnatural deaths such as traffic accidents, homicide with gunshot wounds, etc.; MATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred and fifty three cases with a mean age of 34 years (range 10 to 76) were studied. The decedents were mostly male (92%), with a variety of occupations including laborers (76.9%), traders (15.4%), and student (7.7%). The causes of death were mainly traffic injuries (33%), gunshot wounds (26%) and others (stab wound, poisoning, asphyxia etc 41%). The manner of death was accidents in 40% and homicides in 28%.; RESULTS: Nine percent were positive for methamphetamine or amphetamine derivatives. Tests for Heroin, 6-MAM, morphine, or cocaine were also performed but not detected. The drug positive cases were mostly males (85%) with the most common age range of 21-30 years (35.4%) and 61% with only primary education. Homicide by gunshot wounds was the most common cause of death at 69.2%, followed by hanging (15.4%), electrocution (7.7%), and poisoning (7.7%). The concentration of methamphetamine in urine was between 501-61,147 ng/ml, which cannot be correlated with intoxication. There were no deaths from overdose. Three Benzodiazepine, one toluene, and one meperidine cases were also found in cases of methamphetamine abuse. Alcohol was found mostly in the persons with unnatural deaths (53.6%) from traffic accidents.; CONCLUSION: This information helps us understand the marketing strategies, and the trading routes. All data will be used for planning to eradicate these drugs from Thailand in line with government strategies.

AB Existing research indicates the rate of smoking among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youths exceeds the general population's, possibly due to stress, habitual substance abuse, socializing in smoky venues, and tobacco marketing. The study's overall aim was to conduct qualitative research regarding tobacco use and avoidance by LGBT youths. This report focuses on identifying priority subpopulations and corresponding risk and resiliency factors. Purposive and maximum variation sampling were used to select 30 LGBT youths and 30 interactors for face-to-face interviews. Almost a third of participants said that all LGBT youths are at risk for smoking. Other respondents specified a range of high-risk groups, encompassing many subpopulations. Contributing factors for smoking included personal characteristics, interpersonal issues, environmental conditions, and structural issues. More than a third of young smokers were not acquainted with LGBT nonsmokers and could not imagine how they avoid using tobacco. Half of the interactors and four youths ascribed favorable qualities to nonsmokers--such as self-esteem, will power, and concern for personal health, appearance, and well-being. In conclusion, smoking is a pervasive problem among LGBT youths. The findings corroborate prior explanations and implicate new ones. Some risks (e.g., limited opportunities to socialize with LGBT peers outside of smoking venues, the desire to appear more masculine, and sexuality-related stress) and resiliency factors (e.g., positive sexual identity) are unique to LGBT populations, reinforcing the need for culturally specific approaches to prevention and cessation. Highlighting the positive attributes of nonsmokers and nonsmoking might prove useful in prevention campaigns.

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate knowledge of betel quid (BQ) vendors in relation to traditional chewing and smoking habits in Northern Thailand.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interviews of vendors selling BQ and other traditional chewing and smoking items were conducted. Questions related to side effects of BQC were included, as well as questions focusing on why traditional chewing and smoking habits were on the decline.; RESULTS: Nineteen stalls in 10 markets were visited and 18 vendors were interviewed (16 women, 2 men, average age 55.0 years, range 28-75 years). Vendors had been present for an average of 21.8 years (range 2-60 years). The number of customers buying BQ regularly was 2-3 per day. More elderly women than men bought BQ. Side effects of BQ on the oral mucosa were largely unknown to vendors. Most respondants thought BQ to be good for teeth. Reasons why young people have given up the BQ habit were black teeth. Miang (fermented tea leaves) and khi yo (traditional cigar) were rarely sold and were considered vanishing habits.; CONCLUSIONS: BQ vendors had poor knowledge of the side effects of BQC. BQ vendors unanimously considered traditional habits such as chewing of BQ, miang and smoking of traditional cigars to be on the decline. Nowadays, most of these items are bought to be offered during ceremonies. Generally, traditional habits seem to be replaced by 'modern' lifestyle habits such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. With these changes, general and oral disease patterns will eventually occur.

AB AIM: To estimate the direct and indirect costs of morbidity and mortality attributable to alcohol consumption in Germany from a societal perspective in 2002.; METHODS: Using the concept of attributable risks and the prevalence-based approach, age- and gender-specific alcohol-attributable fractions for morbidity and mortality were calculated for alcoholic disorder, neoplasms, endocrinological, nervous, circulatory, digestive, skin and perinatal disorders, and injuries and poisonings. The literature provided data on alcohol consumption in Germany by age, gender and dose amount, and relative risks. Direct costs were calculated based on routine resource utilisation and expenditure statistics. Indirect costs were calculated based on the human capital approach using a discount rate of 5%.; RESULTS: Alcohol consumption accounted for 5.5% of all deaths and 970,000 years of potential life lost. Total costs were euro24,398 million, amounting to 1.16% of Germany's GDP, or euro296 per person. Direct medical and non-medical costs were euro8441 million. Indirect costs were euro15,957 million (69% mortality and 31% morbidity costs). In contrast, protective health effects of alcohol consumption saved euro4839 million.; CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality and associated costs demands more preventive efforts.

AB Scotland has recently embarked on a new phase of policy and infrastructure development for improving population health and reducing health inequalities that broadly conforms to the Ottawa Charter and WHO's strategic framework for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. The new phase is characterised by an integrated, cross-government approach to improving health with strengthened political and Scottish Executive leadership and investment since devolution. A comprehensive policy framework for improving young people's health and reducing inequalities has been developed across education, health, environment and social justice. It builds on an earlier phase of relative stability and continuity in the health promotion infrastructure with policy focused on CVD and cancer prevention and tackling the behavioural risk factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity) as well as sexual health and mental health and wellbeing. These national strategies are currently being implemented across Scotland. They combine promotion, prevention, treatment and protection goals and target both population-level and high-risk groups. Crosscutting government objectives and headline targets for addressing poverty, disadvantage and health inequalities now supplement the NHS health improvement targets on smoking, alcohol, physical activity, teenage pregnancy and child immunization. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development (anticipatory care) and health system reform to maximize their impact on reducing health inequalities. Efforts to tackle the social determinants of health and reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government with Community Planning Partnerships as the main vehicle. National level mechanisms for integrated funding, planning and performance reporting to deliver shared priority outcomes have yet to be developed. The development of health improvement strategies has been founded upon a rich source of population health data to monitor changes and improvements, epidemiological studies and evaluation work. The key issues have been to find ways of intervening to accelerate the rate of improvement and to stem the growing health inequalities. A further challenge is to ensure that the lessons from reviews and evaluations of past programmes and strategies are not lost, but help to guide improvements in the complex delivery system and to inform future policy direction. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development and health system reform. Efforts to reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government.

AB A landmark in health promotion in Thailand came in 2001 with the launching of the Universal Health Coverage Scheme at the cost of approximately USD 2 billion a year. Another important event was the establishment of the Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth) as a health promotion funding mechanism that draws upon a 2 percent surcharge levied on alcohol and tobacco excise tax, approximately USD 50-60 million a year. The most significant institutional development is the promulgation of the National Health Act in 2007. The Act embraces the principle of human rights and key principles of the Ottawa Charter in 2005. It is a result of five years of extensive public dialogues on important health issues that enhanced public awareness and nation wide networking on health promotion. ThaiHealth regards itself as a catalyst for health promotion. The organisation collaborates with all sectors of the society, from the national to the grassroots level, and is the most notable organisation for health promotion in Thailand. ThaiHealth funds programs on health risks/issues such as alcohol, tobacco, accidents, exercise, as well as area or setting based programs, for example, school, work place, community, and programs that target specific population groups such as the youth, the elderly, Muslim community. The open grants program invites proposals from all kinds of organizations/groups interested in launching health promotion initiatives. The endeavour has started to bear fruit. Smoking and alcohol consumption rates have dropped and more people have become health conscious and do more exercise. However, much remains to be done as some population groups especially the youth have become susceptible to various kinds of health risks. This remarkable start must be sustained and reinforced by the continuation and expansion of knowledge generation and dissemination, relentless policy advocacy and creative public campaign, with a strong health promotion network as the most critical success factor.

AB This article focuses on the erosion of alcohol management policies and the implications for local prevention efforts. It draws lessons from three large-scale multi-year multi-site programs in Canada, e.g., local addiction prevention projects, heart health programs, and tobacco control experiences. It explores five themes: getting alcohol on the agenda and implementing effective local responses to alcohol problems; assessing conceptual frameworks in order to identify the essential components of an effective prevention strategy; developing a system of local prevention initiatives that give priority to long-lasting structural changes; generating accurate information on alcohol-related damage in order to set priorities; and developing a prevention action plan in order to support local initiatives.

AB This short report describes an ongoing project whose aim was to explore how respondents from local institutions in a Swedish municipality describe their efforts in preventing alcohol consumption and related problems. Data were collected in focus group interviews, conducted during 2003 with key informants, comprising middle-ranking civil servants from different administrative sectors such as school, social welfare, and the public health office, in four Swedish municipalities: one city district, one town, and two small municipalities. We identified low knowledge of evidence-based methods for prevention of alcohol consumption-related problems and a lack of consistent focus on strategies known to be effective. The main target group for preventive efforts was identified as young people and the most common setting mentioned was the schools. Further, the key informants appeared to regard a wide range of activities as being community* alcohol and drug use prevention. Generally these activities also lacked specification. Increased knowledge of alcohol and drug use prevention methods that are effective at the local level is needed within Swedish municipalities, as is greater understanding of how to implement those methods.

AB This study examines the prevalence of public injecting and willingness to use drug consumption rooms (DCRs) among UK needle exchange programme (NEP) attendees. Three hundred and one injecting drug users (IDUs) were surveyed using a brief questionnaire across five NEPs in London and Leeds between April and June 2005. Injection in a public place in the past week was reported by 55% of the sample and 84% reported willingness to use a DCR if it was available. Public injecting was positively associated with insecure housing (AOR=2.1, CI 1.2-3.5, p=0.009), unsafe needle and syringe disposal in the past month (AOR=3.6, CI 1.9-6.9, p<0.001) and willingness to use DCR (AOR=2.7, CI 1.3-5.4, p=0.006). Public injecting was negatively associated with being aged more than 30 years (AOR=0.4, CI 0.3-0.7, p=0.003) and living in close proximity (within 0.5 miles/0.8 km) of the usual place of drug purchase (AOR=0.6, CI 0.3-0.9, p=0.02). Our findings suggest that recent public injecting is prevalent among UK NEP attendees and the majority would be willing to use DCRs if available. It is also probable that if such services were located close to key drug markets they would engage vulnerable IDU sub-populations such as young people and the insecurely housed and reduce their levels of public injecting and unsafe needle/syringe disposal. Targeted pilot implementation of DCRs in the UK is recommended.

AB Insulin resistance caused by obesity and lack of physical activity plays a major role for the development of type 2 diabetes. If the reduced insulin action cannot be compensated by overproduction of insulin, glucose regulation disorder is developing. In addition, other trigger factors such as television viewing, sleep, alcohol or smoking are discussed. During the past years an intensification of pharmacological therapy was believed to be the major goal for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, now the value of nonpharmacological treatment improves. While in the past only nutrition was in the view of lifestyle research, recently a number of studies on the value of physical activity were published. In this paper an overview of recent studies showing the therapeutic potential of nonpharmacological therapies will be given. It will also be shown that these measures will not only optimize hyperglycaemia but also all other cardiovascular risk factors.

AB The physiological changes of adolescence may promote risk-taking behaviors, including binge drinking. Approximately 40% of alcoholics were already drinking heavily in late adolescence. Most cases of alcoholism are established by the age of 30 years with the peak prevalence at 18-23 years of age. Therefore the key time frame for the development, and prevention, of alcoholism lies in adolescence and young adulthood. Severe childhood stressors have been associated with increased vulnerability to addiction, however, not all stress-exposed children go on to develop alcoholism. Origins of resilience can be both genetic (variation in alcohol-metabolizing genes, increased susceptibility to alcohol's sedative effects) and environmental (lack of alcohol availability, positive peer and parental support). Genetic vulnerability is likely to be conferred by multiple genes of small to modest effects, possibly only apparent in gene-environment interactions. For example, it has been shown that childhood maltreatment interacts with a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene variant to predict antisocial behavior that is often associated with alcoholism, and an interaction between early life stress and a serotonin transporter promoter variant predicts alcohol abuse in nonhuman primates and depression in humans. In addition, a common Met158 variant in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene can confer both risk and resilience to alcoholism in different drinking environments. It is likely that a complex mix of gene(s)-environment(s) interactions underlie addiction vulnerability and development. Risk-resilience factors can best be determined in longitudinal studies, preferably starting during pregnancy. This kind of research is important for planning future measures to prevent harmful drinking in adolescence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence and determinants of blood-borne virus (BBV) transmission in ethnic Vietnamese injecting drug users (IDUs).; METHODS: The study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, in 2003. It was a cross-sectional design with participants recruited from street-based illicit drug markets predominately using a snowball technique. One hundred and twenty-seven participants completed a questionnaire that asked about illicit drug use and participants' blood samples were tested for HIV, HCV and HBV.; RESULTS: One hundred and three (81.1%) ethnic Vietnamese IDU study participants were HCV positive and three (2.4%) were HIV positive. More than 60% had evidence of being infected with HBV (either in the past, acute infection or chronic infection). Almost 60% had injected daily over the past 12 months. Fifty-nine participants had recently travelled to Vietnam; 24 (41%) had injected drugs in Vietnam; and three (12.5%) reported sharing injecting equipment in Vietnam.; CONCLUSION: The prevalence of BBVs was higher in this study's IDU population compared with IDUs in Australia generally, despite the fact that the injecting risk behaviours were similar to IDUs more generally.; IMPLICATIONS: Culturally sensitive drug treatment and education programs need to be developed in Australia for both ethnic Vietnamese IDUs and their families to reduce this group's risk of contracting a BBV.

AB Despite the huge number of drugs on the market and recent advances in pharmacotherapy, only a few substances are available for the prevention of gastrointestinal tumors--most of which are not approved for this indication or not validated in appropriately designed randomized trials. General recommendations include lifestyle modifications such as avoidance of smoking, only moderate consumption of alcohol, regular physical exercise and a nutrition rich in fresh fruits and vegetables with limited meat. A global eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori would be desirable to prevent gastric carcinoma, but this does not seem feasible from the socio-economic point of view. Therefore, at least patients at high risk should be screened and this pathogen eradicated, preferentially in their youth. Hepatitis B vaccination of newborns to prevent the development of hepatocellular carcinoma has already been established in Germany; a specific antiviral therapy should be offered to all patients with hepatitis B or C infections, taking into consideration the risks associated with this treatment. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to prevent gastrointestinal malignancies cannot generally be recommended and should be restricted to patients at high risk and to clinical studies. However, the appropriate substance, dose and duration of NSAID therapy are still being debated.

Additionally, interactions between student and class level were found. The higher the mean class age the greater the difference in RSOD between boys and girls, and the lower the impact on RSOD of the relative age position in a class.; CONCLUSIONS: In early and mid-adolescence, prevention efforts should try to impede the modelling of alcohol use of older classmates, whereas in late adolescence gender-specific motives for RSOD should be taken into account.

AB OBJECTIVE: To calculate the prevalence of substance abuse and mental illness among suicide victims of different racial/ethnic groups and to identify race/ethnicity trends in mental health and substance abuse that may be used to improve suicide prevention.; METHODS: Data are from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), a state-based data integration system that, for 2004, includes data from 13 US states. The NVDRS integrates medical examiner, toxicology, death certificate, and law enforcement data.; RESULTS: Within participating states, for data year 2004, 6865 suicide incidents in which race/ethnicity are known were identified. This included 5797 (84.4%) non-Hispanic whites, 501 (7.3%) non-Hispanic blacks, 257 (3.7%) Hispanics, and 310 (4.5%) persons from other racial/ethnic groups. At the time of the suicide event, non-Hispanic blacks had lower blood alcohol contents than other groups. Non-Hispanic whites had less cocaine but more antidepressants and opiates. There were no differences in the levels of amphetamines or marijuana by race/ethnicity. Hispanics were less likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness or to have received treatment, although family reports of depression were comparable to non-Hispanic whites and other racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic whites were more likely to be diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder and non-Hispanic blacks with schizophrenia. Comorbid substance abuse and mental health problems were more likely among non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, while Hispanics were more likely to have a substance abuse problem without comorbid mental health problems.; CONCLUSION: The results support earlier research documenting differences in race/ethnicity, substance abuse, and mental health problems as they relate to completed suicide. The data suggest that suicide prevention efforts must address not only substance abuse and mental health problems in general, but the unique personal, family, and social characteristics of different racial/ethnic groups.

AB High rates of Internet use among young adults make online intervention with this population particularly attractive. However, low adherence rates limit the exposure to and the potential effectiveness of these programs. This study identifies strategies for increasing adherence by examining the rates of participation for a 5-week beta (pilot) version and final version of the RealU Web site, an online intervention for college smokers. Three modifications from the beta to the RealU Web site were (a) changing format from a smoking cessation Web site to an online college life magazine, (b) providing proactive peer e-mail support, and (c) adopting a more linear site structure. Participants were recruited via Internet health screening and received US$10 for completing weekly study activities. Enrollment among eligible smokers was higher for the beta compared with the RealU intervention (47/69, 68.1% vs. 517/1618, 32.0%, p<.001), but participants did not differ in terms of age, gender, or past 30-day cigarette or alcohol use. Participation fell sharply during the beta test (53% in week 1 to 26% by week 5) compared with the RealU average of 95% (range 89% to 98%). Participation during each study's final week was much higher in the RealU (93% week 20) compared with the beta (26% week 5, p<.001). After 5 weeks, self-reported 30-day abstinence was higher for RealU intervention participants (16.0%) compared with the beta participants (4.3%, p=.03). The modifications from the beta to RealU Web site described above resulted in high rates of sustained participation over 20 weeks.

AB Advertising is a pervasive influence on children and adolescents. Young people view more than 40,000 ads per year on television alone and increasingly are being exposed to advertising on the Internet, in magazines, and in schools. This exposure may contribute significantly to childhood and adolescent obesity, poor nutrition, and cigarette and alcohol use. Media education has been shown to be effective in mitigating some of the negative effects of advertising on children and adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND: Drug use and abuse may hamper learning capabilities and the development of technical skills in medical students and, therefore, the quality of care offered to patients. The aim of this investigation was to estimate the prevalence of psychoactive drug use among medical students of public universities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and to identify characteristics associated with substance use.; METHOD: This was a cross-sectional investigation designed to include all medical students of four universities. The final sample included 1,054 students. Patterns of licit and illicit drug use (at least once in lifetime drug use, drug use in the last 30 days (LTD) and CAGE) before and during medical school were assessed by a multiple-choice, self-administered anonymous questionnaire.; RESULTS: Alcohol abuse was more prevalent among male students from higher income families. Alcohol LTD use was more prevalent among male students with college-educated parents. Tobacco, cannabis and inhalant lifetime use was more prevalent among males and tranquillizer use among females. Tobacco, cannabis and tranquillizer lifetime use was more prevalent among students with divorced or dead parents. Inhalant lifetime use was more prevalent among students from higher income families. Students who had college-educated, divorced or dead parents or evidenced tobacco, cocaine or inhalant lifetime use were more prevalent among cannabis users. Male students from higher income families had higher prevalence of cocaine lifetime use.; CONCLUSION: Substance use in this group of medical students is not widespread compared to rates reported for developed countries. Preventive efforts should focus on alcohol and cannabis use by medical students.

AB PURPOSE: To determine (1) the prevalence of use, (2) risk and protective factors for use of inhalants in Florida youth.; METHODS: The Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey 2004 is a comprehensive assessment of youth substance abuse attitudes and practices obtained by sampling youth from sixty-five counties.; RESULTS: The sample consisted of 60,345 students from 6th to 12th grade; ages 10 to 19 + years (mean 14.5 years +/- 4), 53% were female with 59% White, 19% African-American, 16% Hispanic, 5% Native American, 2% Asian and 7% other. Lifetime use was highest among 14 year olds (16.5%), and current use among 13 year olds (16.7%). Females had significantly (p < .000) higher rates than males for lifetime (14.2% vs. 12.7%) and current use (5.1% vs. 4.1%). Native Americans had the highest rates of lifetime use (17%) followed by Whites (15%), mixed/other (15%), Hispanics (14%), Asians (13%), and Blacks (9%). The younger the age of first use of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana, the higher the lifetime and current prevalence of use of inhalants. Inhalant users were more likely to be depressed, acknowledge deviant behavior and skipping school, have lower grades, have siblings and friends who used illegal substances and parents with a history of antisocial behavior (p < .000).; CONCLUSION: Inhalant use may be a marker for adolescents with a high-risk profile for subsequent illegal drug use. Prevention efforts should be directed to these students at an early age.

AB BACKGROUND: Twelve percent of Americans are diagnosed and treated for mental illness annually. The relationship between mental illness and intentional injuries such as assault and suicide has previously been described. However, unintentional injury among mentally ill adults has not been characterized. The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between mental illness diagnosis and unintentional injury. We hypothesized that diagnosed mental illness is an independent risk factor for unintentional injury and it increases the risk of recidivism.; METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, trauma registry data, medical records, and outpatient mental health care data from the San Francisco Department of Public Health Billing Information System (BIS) were used to identify patients admitted with unintentional injury at a Level I urban trauma center in 2003 and 2004. Data collected included mechanism of injury, patient outcome and disposition, mental health diagnoses, substance abuse history, presence of homelessness, number of repeat injury events, and outpatient mental health treatment history. The incidence of unintentional injury requiring admission to a trauma center and the risk of intentional injury recidivism in subjects with a mental illness diagnosis were compared with those in subjects without a mental illness diagnosis. The risk of recidivism in those who had received publicly funded outpatient treatment before their injury was also evaluated.; RESULTS: Of the 1,709 patients admitted for unintentional injury, 20% had a diagnosis of mental illness. Individuals with mental illness had twice the rate of unintentional injury requiring admission (2.2-2.4 people in 1,000 vs. 1.0-1.1 in 1,000) and 4.5 times the odds of injury recidivism (odds ratio [OR] = 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.3-6.1) as those who did not have a mental illness diagnosis. Mental illness was a more robust predictor of injury recidivism than substance abuse (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 2.3-4.3) or homelessness (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.4). Compared with the nonmentally ill group, subjects with mental illness had a longer hospital stay and were less likely to be discharged home. Also, their injuries were more likely the result of falling or being hit by cars, and less likely the result of motor vehicle collisions than subjects without mental illness.; CONCLUSIONS: Mental illness is an independent risk factor for unintentional injury and injury recidivism. Individuals with mental illness also have a different pattern of injury and hospitalization. They tended to suffer from different mechanisms of injury, stayed in the hospital longer, and were more likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Recognition of mental illness as a risk factor for injury may prompt re-examination of resource allocation for mental health and injury prevention and highlights the mentally ill as a prime target population for unintentional injury prevention efforts.

AB This study examined the demographic and psychosocial correlates of alcohol-related physical fighting and other physical fighting to determine if the predictors for aggressive behaviors are similar or different when alcohol is involved. Analyses were based on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health which is a nationally representative school based sample of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 (N=18,924). The current analyses were restricted to current drinkers who could be grouped into three categories of involvement in physical fights (n=8866): no fighting; fighting not related to alcohol use; fighting related to alcohol use. Regression models were computed using a backward-elimination procedure. Overall, 38% of adolescent drinkers reported fighting, including 12% who reported alcohol-related fighting and 26% who reported other physical fighting. Non-Hispanic African-American adolescents were most likely to report other physical fighting (37.1%) but they were least likely to report alcohol-related fighting (8.2%). The correlates of alcohol-related fighting differed by age and race/ethnicity. Moreover, since the correlates of alcohol-related fighting pertain mostly to the frequency and quantity of alcohol use and to having alcohol-related problems, prevention efforts that seek to reduce alcohol use or delay alcohol use initiation may also reduce alcohol-related fighting.

AB Public health agencies have recommended incorporating HIV prevention counseling into the medical care of persons living with HIV/AIDS. Injection drug users (IDUs) especially need HIV risk-reduction counseling because of their high risk for HIV transmission through both sexual and injection behaviors. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of, and patient factors associated with, the delivery of HIV prevention messages to HIV-seropositive IDUs in primary care settings. A majority of participants reported having an HIV prevention discussion with their provider during their most recent primary care visit. Factors significantly associated with report of such discussion were being Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black; high school education or less; and better perception of engagement with provider. Medical providers should provide prevention messages to all HIV-seropositive IDUs, regardless of demographic factors. Effective HIV prevention interventions in primary care settings, including interventions to improve patient-provider communication, are needed for HIV-seropositive IDUs.

AB BACKGROUND: In several national surveys, a younger age of onset of first drink and/or regular drinking has been associated with a higher likelihood of the development of alcohol dependence. Some studies have suggested that age at first drink is primarily an environmentally driven variable whereas others suggest that it may be partially mediated by a general vulnerability to exhibit problem behaviors. Although Native Americans, overall, have the highest prevalence of alcohol dependence of any U.S. ethnic group, the relationship of age of onset of intoxication with alcohol dependence in Native American populations is relatively unknown.; METHODS: Demographic information and DSM-III-R diagnoses were obtained from 525 Southwest California (SWC) Indian adults residing on contiguous reservations. Survival analyses and Cox and logistic regression were used to investigate the relationship between age of onset of first intoxication and the development of alcohol dependence. Heritability of the age of onset of first intoxication was also determined using SOLAR.; RESULTS: Age at first intoxication was not found to be heritable in this population. Early onset of intoxication, however, was found to be significantly associated with both a shorter time to onset of alcohol dependence and increased prevalence in this population, even on taking into account several other risk factors including externalizing diagnoses.; CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that effective environmental prevention efforts at reducing underage drinking may be an important strategy to lower the prevalence of alcohol dependence in this high-risk population.

AB This study sought to develop a set of easily obtainable, relevant measures of a community's condition that could be used to guide its suicide prevention efforts. Existing data were gathered across 159 Georgia counties for nine potential social indicators (rates of net migration, divorce, unemployment, violent crimes reported, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs [DUI] crashes, high school dropouts, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF], percentage of population aged 65 or older, and percentage of population who are white males) that had been chosen by the communities. Data on the social indicators from 1995 through 1999 were averaged and analyzed to determine their correlation with aggregated 5-year county suicide rates. Results of multivariate modeling procedures showed number of DUI crashes and percentage of the population aged 65 or older to be significant correlates of the suicide rate, controlling for other potential indicators. These preliminary data may provide a useful model of a county's 5-year suicide rate among counties reporting 20 or more suicides. Research with additional indicators and in other states will help determine the generalizability of these findings to other communities.

AB OBJECTIVE: This prospective study examines the association of educational status in 1984 and the risk for past-year Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) in 1994, 10 years later.; METHOD: A sample of 8,661 respondents was drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience in Youth. Measures included baseline heavy episodic drinking, alcohol-dependence symptoms, early problem behaviors (antisocial behaviors, illicit substance use, family history of alcoholism, and age at onset of alcohol use), demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age, marital status), and 1994 assessment for past-year DSM-IV AUDs.; RESULTS: Findings from this 10-year prospective study indicate that education beyond high school had a protective effect for alcohol dependence, and dropping out of high school resulted in an elevated long-term risk for alcohol dependence. These associations remained significant when other early behavioral problems were included in the models.; CONCLUSIONS: The risk of alcohol dependence and, consequently, the need for appropriately tailored prevention efforts is greater among high school dropouts and college nonattenders than among college students, although much of the current literature has focused on the latter.

AB PURPOSE: To support efforts to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), population-based data are needed on the prevalence of alcohol use at any time during gestation, particularly among women who were recent and at-risk drinkers.; METHODS: We used National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experiences in Youth (NLSY) files to estimate the prevalence of any drinking during pregnancy and to evaluate alcohol history risk factors among 6676 births reported by women with prepregnancy drinking data. Prevalence estimates were obtained for 2-year intervals for all 1982-1995 births and for subsets with prepregnancy recent and at-risk drinking.; RESULTS: Among all births, drinking during pregnancy declined from 38.3% in 1982-1983 to 23.0% in 1994-1995 (p < 0.0001). Drinking during pregnancy also declined over time among recent and at-risk drinkers (p < 0.0001), but the 1994-1995 prevalences were still high (39.3% and 29.0%, respectively). Adjusted logistic models confirmed both the decrease in risk for the later birth years and the persistent heightened risk for births among recent and at-risk drinkers.; CONCLUSIONS: In addition to ongoing universal prevention strategies that have helped reduce the prevalence of drinking during pregnancy, selective and indicated prevention approaches are needed to encourage abstinence during pregnancy among recent and at-risk drinkers.

AB AIMS: To determine the incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and identify risk factors for seroconversion.; DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Participants were recruited through direct approaches, street-based outreach, methadone and sexual health clinics and needle and syringe programmes.; SETTING: Urban, regional and rural settings in New South Wales, Australia.; PARTICIPANTS: Injecting drug users (IDUs) (n = 584) were screened and tested for exposure to HCV. Between 1999 and 2002 antibody HCV negative IDUs (n = 368) were enrolled and followed-up every 3-6 months until seroconversion or study completion.; MEASUREMENTS: Interviewer-administered baseline and follow-up questionnaires consisted of 131 items and included demographics, drug use and risk behaviour. Approximately 10 cc of whole blood was drawn at each visit. Specimens were stored at -70C and serology performed using one or two third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and polymerase chain reaction testing.; FINDINGS: Sixty-eight seroconversions were observed and incidence was 30.8 per 100 person-years, with incidence in IDUs injecting < 1 year, 133 per 100 person-years. Independent predictors of seroconversion were female gender, duration of injecting, injecting cocaine, shared use of filters and recruitment strategy.; CONCLUSIONS: Women, new initiates and IDUs recruited via outreach appear to be at increased risk of infection. Results confirm the significance of cocaine injection as a risk factor and provide the first evidence outside North America of the link between shared use of drug preparation equipment and incident HCV infection. Prevention efforts should attempt to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug sharing and, in particular, the role of potentially contaminated syringes in HCV infection.

AB Three hundred and six sexually experienced adolescents participated in a study on sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence and associated risk factors. The prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoea (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and syphilis was 4.5%, 9%, 8% and 4% for females and 4.7%, 5.7%, 0% and 2.8% for males. HIV-seropositivity was found in 15.2% of females and 5.8% of males. Structured face-to-face interviews were used to obtain information about social background, sexual experience and genital symptoms. Four focus-group discussions were used in order to validate the interview data. Females were more likely to be infected by the four treatable STIs and HIV, despite risky behavior being more common among males. Unemployment, little formal education, the presence of bacterial STIs and post-coital bleeding or a bad smell from the vagina was highly associated with the risk for HIV in females. The higher prevalence of STIs, including HIV, among adolescent girls cannot be explained by sexual behavior only, as boys reported more risk behavior and were still less affected by STIs. Biological and social factors are definitely of importance.

AB Nyanza Province, Kenya is characterized by poor water quality and high diarrhoea prevalence. To address these problems, nurses in a maternal and child health clinic in Homa Bay, Kenya were trained in household water chlorination with a locally available, social marketed product, and in six steps of proper hand washing. They were asked to communicate this information to their clients. Interviews immediately following the training by nurses were conducted on 220 clients, of whom 168 (76%) reported being taught both procedures during their clinic visit. After 2 weeks, free chlorine residuals were present in stored drinking water in 67 out of 98 (68%) clients' homes and, 1 year later, in 36 out of 51 (71%) clients' homes. After 2 weeks, all six hand-washing steps were correctly demonstrated by 41 (44%) out of 93 clients, and by 17 out of 51 (34%) 1 year later. This brief, practical intervention shows promise for vulnerable populations.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report on a new modelling approach developed for the assessing cost-effectiveness in obesity (ACE-Obesity) project and the likely population health benefit and strength of evidence for 13 potential obesity prevention interventions in children and adolescents in Australia.; METHODS: We used the best available evidence, including evidence from non-traditional epidemiological study designs, to determine the health benefits as body mass index (BMI) units saved and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved. We developed new methods to model the impact of behaviours on BMI post-intervention where this was not measured and the impacts on DALYs over the child's lifetime (on the assumption that changes in BMI were maintained into adulthood). A working group of stakeholders provided input into decisions on the selection of interventions, the assumptions for modelling and the strength of the evidence.; RESULTS: The likely health benefit varied considerably, as did the strength of the evidence from which that health benefit was calculated. The greatest health benefit is likely to be achieved by the 'Reduction of TV advertising of high fat and/or high sugar foods and drinks to children', 'Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding' and the 'multi-faceted school-based programme with an active physical education component' interventions.; CONCLUSIONS: The use of consistent methods and common health outcome measures enables valid comparison of the potential impact of interventions, but comparisons must take into account the strength of the evidence used. Other considerations, including cost-effectiveness and acceptability to stakeholders, will be presented in future ACE-Obesity papers. Information gaps identified include the need for new and more effective initiatives for the prevention of overweight and obesity and for better evaluations of public health interventions.

AB A major factor attributed to the problem and consequences of underage alcohol use is binge drinking. The objective of this study was to examine binge drinking and other alcohol-related problem behaviour among high-risk male and female adolescents who were from alternative schools and programs because of learning and/or behaviour problems. Self-report data were collected from a purposive sample of 917 adolescents in Israel who ranged from 12 to 18 years. Binge drinking during the last 30 days prior to the survey was reported by 33% of males and 23% of females (p<.001). Results of other alcohol-related behaviour showed gender status not related to being in a car when the driver had been drinking (12%) or having driven a car or motorcycle after drinking (5%). Multiple regression analysis showed binge drinking related to what a youth does with time; a decline in relations with family members; selling drugs; and, having been in a serious fight during the last 12 months. Country of origin, i.e. born in Israel or the Former Soviet Union, was not found linked to binge drinking. Further research of binge drinking and alcohol-related problem behaviour among high-risk youth is important so that it can be applied to immediate and longstanding prevention efforts.

AB Adolescent suicide is today a public health problem among the leading cause of mortality among adolescents and young adults. There seems to be many reasons for this increase (which has different trends in different populations), but associations have been found with increased substance abuse, television and video violence, socio-economic status and easy access to firearms. Gender differences have also been observed with crime, suicide and substance abuse higher among males, while eating disorder, depression and suicidal behavior more prevalent among females. This paper will review prevalence and incidence of adolescent suicidal behavior, socio-demographic and psychological risk factors, associated cognitive factors and socio-economic factors. Risk factors include previous suicide attempts, a history of others in the family who have been suicidal, mental illness, alcohol and drug use, and other self-destructive behaviors as well as consideration being given to hopelessness, hostility, negative self-concept and isolation. At the individual difference level, factors such as trait depression, anger and hostility, perfectionism and social sensitivity would seem critical variables, as would age, gender and intellectual functioning. Sociological and family-related factors may also be implicated including dysfunctional family organizations, a history of physical or psychological abuse (sexual abuse) and limited extent of social support networks. A frequently reported precipitating event of suicidal behavior is family adversity including rejection, separation and interpersonal conflict. At a socio-economic level it would seem essential to provide comprehensive document about the social and economic conditions from which the adolescent comes.

AB BACKGROUND: Following the marketing ban of ephedra-containing supplements in April 2004, many manufacturers substituted the herb Citrus aurantium for ephedra and marketed the products as "ephedra-free" supplements. Extracts of C. aurantium contain synephrine, a sympathomimetic alkaloid.; OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of consumption of dietary supplements containing C. aurantium in California during 2004.; METHODS: We used the 2004 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey to determine the prevalence of consumption of dietary supplements containing C. aurantium in California during 2004.; RESULTS: Two percent (n = 70) of the 4140 survey respondents reported taking a dietary supplement containing C. aurantium in the previous year. Reasons stated included energy enhancement, weight loss, and appetite suppression. Compared with nonusers, users were more likely to report being single, aged 18-34 years, and Hispanic; consuming 3 or more alcoholic drinks on days that they imbibed; and having a heavier body mass index. Among the 5 users who reported experiencing an adverse event that they attributed to the supplement, 3 indicated that the severity was mild.; CONCLUSIONS: Given that supplements containing ephedra were banned in April 2004, the results from this study may serve as a baseline estimate against which future studies of the use of C. aurantium products may be compared.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in youth exposure to alcohol advertising on television across different demographic groups.; METHODS: We used television ratings data on alcohol advertisements to examine trends in exposure between September 1998 and February 2002. Further, we explored the differences in exposure across demographic groups by examining group-level alcohol ad exposure across specific networks, program types, and times of day.; RESULTS: We found that boys were more exposed than girls and African-Americans are more exposed than whites. Moreover, the race differential appeared to be increasing over time, whereas the gender differential appeared to increase with age. Differences in viewing patterns across race and gender contributed to the observed differences in exposure to alcohol advertising on television.; CONCLUSIONS: These results provide guidance in identifying comparative vulnerabilities in exposure to alcohol advertising on television, and can aid in the development of strategies to inoculate youth against those vulnerabilities.

AB Young adult men and women (N=53) who regularly consume malt liquor (i.e., 40 oz/week) participated in 10 semi-structured focus groups. Group transcripts were analyzed using a multilevel process that focused on recurring themes across multiple groups. Commonly identified themes encompassed positive and negative qualities of malt liquor as well as contexts in which malt liquor was consumed. Some of the themes were corroborated by quantitative data on drinking behavior and other variables. The focus groups were designed to explore the unique characteristics of malt liquor (low price, high alcohol content, large volume packaging) that enhance consumption patterns and increase risk for excessive alcohol use. The combination of qualitative and quantitative data provides a unique and useful perspective for identifying issues for future research on malt liquor consumption.

AB In the United States, more underage youth drink alcohol than smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Excessive alcohol consumption leads to many adverse health and social consequences and results in approximately 4,500 deaths among underage youth each year. Recent studies have emphasized the contribution of alcohol marketing to underage drinking and have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of alcohol advertising appears in media for which the audience composition is youth-oriented (i.e., composed disproportionately of persons aged 12-20 years). To determine the proportion of radio advertisements that occurred on radio programs with audiences composed disproportionately of underage youth and the proportion of total youth exposure to alcohol advertising that occurs as a result of such advertising, researchers at the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth (Health Policy Institute, Georgetown University, District of Columbia) evaluated the placement of individual radio advertisements for the most advertised U.S. alcohol brands and the composition of audiences in the largest 104 markets in the United States. This report summarizes the results of that study, which indicate that alcohol advertising is common on radio programs which have disproportionately large youth audiences and that this advertising accounts for a substantial proportion of all alcohol radio advertising heard by underage youth. These results further indicate that 1) the current voluntary standards limiting alcohol marketing to youth should be enforced and ultimately strengthened, and 2) ongoing monitoring of youth exposure to alcohol advertising should continue.

AB OBJECTIVES: Prenatal exposure to alcohol interferes with fetal development and is the leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The purpose of this study was to identify current knowledge, diagnosis, prevention, and intervention practices related to fetal alcohol syndrome and related conditions by members of the American Academy of Pediatrics.; METHODS: This study was developed collaboratively by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Questionnaires were mailed to a 3% random sample (n = 1600) of American Academy of Pediatrics members in the United States. General pediatricians, pediatric subspecialists, and pediatric residents were included.; RESULTS: Participation rate was 55% (n = 879). Respondents almost universally knew the teratology and clinical presentation of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. However, they were less likely to report comfort with routine pediatric care of these children. Whereas 62% felt prepared to identify and 50% felt prepared to diagnose, only 34% felt prepared to manage and coordinate the treatment of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Even fewer (n = 114 [13%]) reported that they routinely counsel adolescent patients about the risks of drinking and pregnancy.; CONCLUSIONS: The survey confirms that pediatricians are knowledgeable about fetal alcohol syndrome but do not feel adequately trained to integrate the management of this diagnosis or prevention efforts into everyday practice. Furthermore, the respondents were not active in routine anticipatory guidance with adolescents for prevention of alcohol-affected pregnancies. The development, dissemination, and implementation of best practice tools for prevention, diagnosis, and referral of fetal alcohol syndrome that are specific for general and subspecialist pediatricians are recommended.

AB Certain types of athletic involvement may confer risk for substance use by college students. This study investigated whether motivational factors play a role in the relationship between athletic involvement and substance use. Intercollegiate athletes (n=98) and exercisers (n=120) were surveyed about substance use and motivation for athletic involvement. Athletes and exercisers who were extrinsically motivated had significantly higher rates of alcohol use than their intrinsically motivated counterparts. Results suggest that college students who are extrinsically motivated for involvement in physical activity/athletics--particularly those involved in team sports--may be in need of targeted prevention efforts.

AB Dietary patterns have been identified in adults, but less is known about children and adolescents. For the first time, we have investigated lifestyle patterns combining diet and physical activity in 12-year-old French preadolescents and examined their association with sociodemographic factors. Physical activity, sedentary activities and dietary habits were assessed by questionnaires given to 2724 students in 2001. Family income tax and parents' educational level, as indicators of socio-economic status, and the size of the residence commune were obtained from parents. After adjusting for socio-economic status, physical activity was positively associated with a consumption of fruit/vegetables/fruit juice on more than four occasions in the previous 24 h (P<0.001). Sedentary activities were positively associated with the consumption of French fries or potato chips (P<0.001), with sweetened drink as the most usual drink (P<0.001) and with nibbling while watching television (P<0.001), and inversely associated with a high consumption of fruit/vegetables/fruit juice (P=0.04). Multiple correspondence analysis identified two independent axes and specific combinations of behaviour: one axis characterised by sedentary activity, sweetened drink as the most usual drink, the consumption of French fries or potato chips and nibbling while watching television; a second one associating physical activity and the consumption of fruit/vegetables/fruit juice. Both socio-economic proxies were associated with the former axis (P<0.001). The size of the residence commune was associated with the latter (P<0.1). Combinations of diet and physical activity habits were identified in adolescents, indicating that prevention programmes targeting both behaviours may have an enhanced outcome.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate the aggregation of health behaviors among fourth graders in northern Taiwan.; METHODS: This study conducted an analysis of data collected from the 2001 Child and Adolescent Behaviors in Long-term Evolution (CABLE) project, which included a sample of 2075 fourth grade students. Factor analysis and cluster analysis were used to investigate the aggregation patterns.; RESULTS: After factor analysis, we found that the 18 health behaviors could be grouped under five factors. These five factors were named: healthy behavior, rule-breaking behavior, substance use behavior, violent behavior, and pleasure-seeking behavior, according to the characteristics of the various health behaviors grouped under each of them. Each study subject was assigned points for each of these five factors and then cluster analysis was used to divide the subjects into four different clusters. The names of these clusters and the percentage of subjects within them were as follows: healthy group (43.47%), violent group (29.11%), pleasure-seeking group (22.55%), and rebellious group (4.87%).; CONCLUSIONS: A total of 56.53% of the study sample were grouped under unhealthy groups (violent group, pleasure-seeking group and rebellious group), which indicates that already more than half of the students had lifestyles that put their health at risk. It was suggested that health and educational organizations need to place importance on behavioral problems in children and adopt early prevention measures.

AB HIV/AIDS is a health crisis for African Americans. African American women are exposed to HIV primarily through sexual behavior, which is an increased risk for women who use drugs. The study design was a mixed method consisting of an ethnography with ongoing participant observation and in-depth interviews and a questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire component was to explore drug use, sexual behavior, health history, and perceptions. The questionnaire was administered at months 6 and 18. Data for this report were derived from the first questionnaire with 30 respondents. The majority of respondents (82.7%) used polysubstances consisting of cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol. Between 33% and 50% exchanged sex for drugs or money, with less than half ever using condoms. About 37% perceived that they had no risk of acquiring HIV, whereas 52% perceived a 25% chance. The pattern of HIV testing in which 33% of the women were tested 10 times or more was unexpected because of the low perception of risk. The principal conclusion was that there is great need to intervene with prevention efforts targeting rural women who use drugs in an attempt to curb increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections including HIV.

AB We undertook a retrospective medical chart review of HIV-infected adolescents referred to a Southern US urban comprehensive adolescent HIV clinic between 1992 and 2003 to describe the psychosocial profile of adolescents infected with HIV via high-risk behaviours.Ninety-one adolescents (59 females, 32 males, 95% African-American, median age 17 years) were identified. Common reasons for initial HIV testing included routine prenatal screening (20%), clinical symptoms suggestive of HIV (20%), and recognized risk-related behaviours (20%). Findings included a history of unstable housing in the previous year (27%), running away (29%), knowing someone with HIV (36%), parental substance abuse (reported by youth, 46%), parental abandonment/neglect (30%), high substance use rates (marijuana 33%, tobacco 27%), current/prior STDs (60%), and involvement with the juvenile justice system or incarceration (41%). Sexual abuse/assault was reported by 41%. Previous depression was reported in 15% with approximately half reporting prior hospitalization. An additional 12% of the cohort had current clinical depressive symptoms. We conclude that infections with HIV via high-risk behaviours during adolescence occur in youth with multiple psychosocial stressors. Targeted prevention efforts to reduce these underlying stressors may decrease new adolescent infection. HIV-infected youth are best served in a comprehensive care environment with immediate access to medical care, social work, and psychology/psychiatry services.

AB College student alcohol abuse remains a significant public health problem, and there is a need for theory-driven and empirically based models to guide prevention efforts. Behavioral theories of choice assume that the decision to consume alcohol is influenced by the relative value of alcohol versus other available activities. In the present study, a sample of college student drinkers (N=108; 56% female, 44% male) who had previously completed a mandatory alcohol intervention completed a measure of alcohol-related and alcohol-free activity participation and enjoyment. The goals of the study were to examine the influence of drinking quantity and contextual variables on activity enjoyment and to identify enjoyable alcohol-free activities that take place on evenings when students might otherwise be drinking. Overall, students found alcohol-related activities more enjoyable than alcohol-free activities, and drinking quantity was positively related to enjoyment. However, alcohol-free activities such as watching movies, going to the theater or museums, going to bars or parties, hanging out with friends, eating at restaurants, and engaging in creative activity were generally as enjoyable as drinking. Alcohol-free activities that included peers or dates were more enjoyable than solitary activities. Men were less likely to engage in alcohol-free activities that included peers and reported less enjoyment related to alcohol-free activities than did women. Further research is required to identify procedures for increasing participation in alcohol-free activities and to determine whether increased alcohol-free activity participation results in decreased alcohol consumption.

AB The purpose of this article was to review population-based interventions for preventing childhood obesity carried out in school settings published between 1999 and 2004. A total of 11 such interventions were found from USA and UK. The grade of the interventions was from kindergarten, primary grades, middle school to high school. Most of these interventions targeted both physical activity and nutrition behaviours although there were some interventions that focused on only one dimension such as TV watching or restricting drinking of carbonated drinks or increasing physical education time in the school. Most of the interventions were based on some behavioural theory and the most popular theory was social cognitive theory. Most of the interventions focused on individual level behaviour change approaches. Most of the interventions focused on short-term changes right after the intervention. On the whole, interventions resulted in modest changes in behaviours and mixed results with indicators of obesity. TV watching seems to be most modifiable behaviour, followed by physical activity and nutrition behaviours. The outcome measures such as lowered BMI (body mass index), triceps skin-fold thickness and waist circumference have not been measured by all studies. Recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of school-based childhood obesity interventions are presented.

AB CONTEXT: Previous research has found that exposure to violence in the home, community, and electronic media are associated with children's and adolescents' normative expectations concerning the use of violence and with other indicators of the violent behaviors by youth.; OBJECTIVE: Our purpose with this study was to examine the relationships between the frequency that high school students reported watching wrestling on television and engaging in date fighting, weapon carrying, and other fighting behaviors.; DESIGN: The initial analysis consisted of a cross-sectional study of a simple random sample of high school students, which was followed by a longitudinal analysis of these students over a 6- to 7-month period.; SETTING: The setting was all public high schools in 1 city/county system.; PARTICIPANTS: We used a simple random sample (N = 2228) of students.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variables included the frequency of date fighting during the previous 12 months and alcohol or other drug involvement associated with the last date fight.; RESULTS: There were significant correlations between frequency of watching wrestling on television during the previous 2 weeks and engaging in date fighting, fighting in general, and weapon carrying for both males and females, although the relationships were stronger among females than among males. The frequency of watching wrestling was highest among students reporting date fighting when either the victim or perpetrator had been drinking alcohol or using illegal drugs. When analyzed using logistic regression, the strongest relationships were observed between the frequency of watching wrestling and date-fight perpetration among females in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. These findings persisted after adjusting for multiple other factors.; CONCLUSIONS: For males and females, the frequency of watching wrestling was highest among students who fought with their dates when alcohol or other drugs were involved. The association between watching wrestling and date fighting was stronger among females than males. The relationship between watching wrestling on television and being the perpetrator of dating violence was also stronger among females and remained consistent over a 6- to 7-month time period.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether use and early-onset use of cigarettes, alcohol and cannabis contributed an increase in risk for initiation of subsequent psychoactive substances in women (N = 3729, mean age = 21.7).; METHODS: Drugs were ordered in ascending order of initiation: cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis and other illicit drugs, with early-onset use of each drug used as a time-varying covariate to predict initiation of subsequent drugs. Interactions of use and early-onset use, with age of initiation of subsequent drugs, were evaluated using discrete-time Cox survival analyses.; RESULTS: The association between each substance and the early-onset of subsequent drug use was strong (ORs 1.54-19.9). Women who initiated cigarette, alcohol or cannabis use at an early age were at elevated risk for early experimentation with each subsequent drug class. Furthermore, early-onset of more than one substance contributed greater risk for initiation of subsequent drugs.; CONCLUSION: Prevention efforts should target risk factors that contribute to early initiation of cigarette and alcohol use and may subsequently correlate with hard drug involvement.

AB OBJECTIVES: To explore how time spent watching television (TV) is associated with the dietary behaviours of New Zealand children and young adolescents.; DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: In homes or schools of New Zealand school students.; PARTICIPANTS: In total, 3275 children aged 5 to 14 years.; RESULTS: The odds of being overweight or obese increased with duration of TV viewing for children and adolescents when controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status and physical activity. Children and adolescents who watched the most TV were significantly more likely to be higher consumers of foods most commonly advertised on TV: soft drinks and fruit drinks, some sweets and snacks, and some fast foods. Both children and adolescents watching two or more hours of TV a day were more than twice as likely to drink soft drinks five times a week or more (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively), eat hamburgers at least once a week (both P = 0.02), and eat French fries at least once a week (both P < 0.01).; CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that longer duration of TV watching (thus, more frequent exposure to advertising) influences the frequency of consumption of soft drinks, some sweets and snacks, and some fast foods among children and young adolescents. Efforts to curtail the amount of time children spend watching TV may result in better dietary habits and weight control for children and adolescents. Future studies examining the impact of advertising on children's diets through interventions and international comparisons of legislation would provide more definitive evidence of the role of advertising in child and adolescent obesity.

Logistic regression analyses determined correlation of variables to HIV infection.; RESULTS: Of 448 women, 10% (45) were HIV infected, which was associated with ever injecting drugs (AOR = 20.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.69-53.07), street-based sex work (AOR = 4.52; 95% CI, 1.84-11.12), exchanging sex for drugs (AOR = 4.74; 95% CI, 1.84-12.18), and more sexually transmitted infection treatments in the preceding 3 months (AOR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.14-5.17).; CONCLUSIONS: Although injection drug use is the strongest correlate to HIV infection, sexual risk behaviors are independently related and should receive focus in prevention efforts targeted to this population.

AB PURPOSE: To prospectively examine the link between positive and negative drinking expectancies and hazardous alcohol use, and to explore the reciprocal associations between expectancies and hazardous use among female college athletes.; METHOD: Participants were part of a larger (n = 189), ongoing longitudinal study on female athletes' socialization experiences and health behaviors from an all-women's college in the Northeastern United States. The sample for the present study were 85 college-aged (17-22 years) female students (Mean age = 19.6) who indicated alcohol use in the past year and provided data at both time points (baseline and one year later). Respondents completed self-report questionnaires on their age, hazardous alcohol use, and expectations about the effects of drinking.; RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed that positive drinking expectancies predicted increased odds of hazardous alcohol use at baseline and one year later (even after controlling for baseline hazardous use). Positive expectancies accounted for a higher proportion of variance in predicting increased odds of hazardous alcohol use at both time points than did negative expectancies. Bivariate correlational analyses examining the bi-directional associations between expectancies and hazardous alcohol use also revealed some indication that positive expectancies were associated with hazardous alcohol use rather than vice-versa. No such relations emerged for negative expectancies.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings shed light on the utility of positive expectancies in predicting concurrent and subsequent hazardous alcohol use among female student-athletes. Future research directions and potential implications for prevention efforts are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine HIV-risk behaviors among a sample of psychiatric inpatient adolescents with and without comorbid SUD.  METHOD: 239 adolescents (60.7% female; mean age=15.3) were interviewed while hospitalized in a psychiatric inpatient treatment facility. Adolescents with and without substance use disorder (SUD) were compared on a number of HIV-risk behaviors and the association between HIV-risk behaviors and other types of mental health problems were examined.  RESULTS: Compared to those without SUD, adolescents with SUD, after controlling for age, gender, and other psychiatric disorders, were at an increased risk for being currently sexually active (AOR=2.01, CI=1.00-4.04, p<.05) and for having used alcohol or drugs prior to last sexual intercourse (AOR=5.48, CI=1.91-15.72, p<.01). HIV-risk behaviors were more evident among adolescents with externalizing disorders and those with higher levels of self-reported distress.  CONCULSION: Adolescents in psychiatric settings, especially those with substance use disorders and/or externalizing problems, are an important population for whom prevention efforts are needed to reduce the risk of HIV infection.

AB OBJECTIVE: Very few studies specifically have examined the health status of 20-year-olds. The purpose of the present study is to examine the changes in health status and behaviour among young Swiss adults between 1993 and 2003.; METHODS: The present study used data from the Swiss Federal Surveys of Adolescents, conducted in 1993 and 2003 among 20-year-olds in Switzerland. The study sample included military recruits and a representative community cohort. More than 20,000 subjects participated in each survey.; RESULTS: Young adults in 2003 reported fewer traffic- and sports-related accidents, but more work-related and other accidents versus young adults in 1993. A greater percentage of men were overweight or obese in 2003. Also in 2003, a greater percentage of males and females regularly used alcohol, cigarettes and cannabis. In particular, the number that smoked cigarettes daily increased by almost 30% and daily cannabis users increased more than two-fold. Young adults reported higher rates of inter-personal violence and theft in 2003. Compared to 1993, in 2003 young adults were more likely to report a sense of coherence; they also had fewer thoughts of suicide, but a greater sense that life is meaningless.; CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first Swiss data comparing the health status of 20-year-olds a decade apart. The findings suggest a significant increase in substance use. Health prevention efforts among young adults ages 18-24 should focus on substance use. In addition, developing strategies to decrease interpersonal violence, delinquent behaviour, and obesity should be a major public health priority.

AB AIMS: To investigate the prospective influence of social influence and social bonding variables on the development of alcohol outcome expectancies among adolescents with and without drinking experience.; DESIGN: Longitudinal data from students in the control schools of a field trial designed to evaluate a school-based drug prevention program.; SETTING: A total of 19 middle schools in South Dakota, USA.; MEASUREMENTS: An alcohol outcome expectancy scale administered to 1410 students in grades 8 and 9. After using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to develop an expectancies measure, multiple-group (grade 8 drinkers versus grade 8 non-drinkers) path analysis was used to model 9th grade alcohol expectancies. Grade 8 social influence and bonding variables were used as predictors, controlling for grade 8 expectancies.; FINDINGS: At the bivariate level, peer and adult influences and social bonding variables were related consistently to alcohol outcome expectancies among drinkers and non-drinkers. A bivariate relationship between alcohol advertising and alcohol expectancies was found among drinkers only. In the multivariate model, greater alcohol use by important adults predicted independently increased alcohol positivity among drinkers; greater perceived approval of alcohol use by parents and peers predicted diminished perceived potency of alcohol among non-drinkers. Advertisement exposure and social bonding variables were not independent predictors of alcohol expectancies in the multivariate model.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that attempts to alter adolescents' alcohol expectancies are likely to fail unless they address the influence of immediate social models on these beliefs.

AB The aims of the study were to examine the relationship between multiple victimisation and drug use, and the role of drug use and other intra-personal, peer, parental and environmental factors in predicting multiple victimisation among adolescents in South Africa. A cross-sectional design was employed. The participants comprised 1474 male and female adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years, from Durban and Cape Town. They completed questionnaire measures assessing demographic characteristics; self, peer and parental drug use; self and peer delinquency; parental child-centredness and rules; and community drug availability and exposure to violence on television. A measure of multiple victimisation assessed whether or not the respondents had experienced two or more different types of violence in their lifetime. There was a significant association between frequency of tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use and multiple victimisation. Significant predictors of multiple victimisation in multiple logistic regression analyses were variables within intra-personal, peer, parental and environmental domains. Victimisation prevention programmes in South Africa should be comprehensive and target adolescents' drug use as well as their other psychosocial risk factors.

AB The progression to alcohol dependence unfolds across multiple stages, including the decision to initiate use, the development of regular patterns of use, and (for some individuals) the subsequent development of problems associated with alcohol use. Using data from two population-based, longitudinal twin studies, FinnTwin16 (FT16) and FinnTwin12 (FT12), we applied multiple stage genetic models (Heath et al., Twin Res. 5 (2002) 113) to better understand the extent to which genetic and environmental influences impact the initiation of alcohol use, frequency of use in adolescence and young adulthood, and alcohol problems in young adulthood. Shared environmental factors played a large role in initiation, and a more moderate role on frequency of use, and it was largely the same influences acting across these stages of use. However, there was no significant evidence of shared environmental influences on alcohol problems in early adulthood. Problems were largely influenced by genetic factors that overlapped with genetic influences on frequency of use. Unique environmental factors were largely specific to each stage, with some overlap between alcohol problems and frequency of use at age 25.

AB Are genetic and environmental risks for adolescent substance use specific to individual substances or general across substance classes? We examined this question in 645 monozygotic twin pairs, 702 dizygotic twin pairs, 429 biological sibling pairs, and 96 adoptive (biologically unrelated) sibling pairs ascertained from community-based samples, and ranging in age from 12 to 18 years. Substance use patterns and symptoms were assessed using structured psychiatric interviews. Biometrical model fitting was carried out using age- and sex-specific thresholds for (a) repeated use and (b) problem use, defined as one or more DSM-IV symptoms of abuse or dependence. We hypothesized that problem use would be more heritable than use in adolescence, and that both genetic and environmental risks underlying tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use and problem use would be significantly correlated. Results of univariate analyses suggested significant heritable factors for use and problem use for all substances with the exception of alcohol use. Shared environmental factors were important in all cases and special twin environmental factors were significant for tobacco use, tobacco problem use, and alcohol use. Multivariate analyses yielded significant genetic correlations between each of the substances (for both levels studied), and significant shared environmental correlations among use variables only. Our results suggest that tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana problem use are mediated by common genetic influences, but shared environmental influences may be more substance-specific for problem use.

AB The cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) subfamily (mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is responsible for metabolizing approximately half of currently marketed drugs, but with considerable interindividual variability in expression and function. To investigate factors contributing to this variability, rates of midazolam (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 protein content were determined using a set of 54 human liver microsomes (HLMs). Genetic factors investigated included CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes, CYP3A4 mRNA alternative splicing, and CYP3A4 transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites. Demographic and environmental factors investigated included age, gender, and histories of smoking and alcohol consumption. MDZ 1'-hydroxylation rates varied from 0.025 to 3.106 nmol/min/mg protein, with significant correlation to CYP3A4 protein content (r(s) = 0.92, P < 0.001) but less robust correlation to CYP3A5 protein content (r(s) = 0.60, P < 0.001). We identified eight CYP3A4 SNPs (five novel) and nine CYP3A5 SNPs (one novel), as well as seven CYP3A4 and two CYP3A5 haplotypes (all novel). No influence of genotype or haplotype on MDZ 1'-hydroxylation rate was observed, although CYP3A5*3A (g.6986a>g; g.31611c>t) carriers had lower CYP3A5 protein content compared with noncarriers (P = 0.004). No alternative splicing of CYP3A4 mRNA was found. Likewise, only a single transcriptional start site and polyadenylation site for CYP3A4 mRNA were identified. Subjects with a history of alcohol consumption had 2.2-fold higher median MDZ 1'-hydroxylation (P = 0.017), whereas no influence of age, gender, or smoking was evident. In conclusion, the investigated genetic factors did not contribute substantially to the large interindividual variability in midazolam hydroxylation, although alcohol consumption has a discernable but modest influence.

AB Obesity is considered a major Public Health issue in most developed countries nowadays for its wide spread across population groups, as well as its contribution to the development of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Available population data in Spain from the SEEDO'2000 study show a prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2)) of 14,5% in adults aged 25-60 years, estimates based on individual measurement of body weight and height. Obesity rates are higher among women aged 45 years and older, low social class, living in semi-urban places. Geographical distribution of the problem shows a trend for higher rates towards the South- SouthEast of the country, i.e. Andalucia, Murcia and the Canary Islands. Population data for Spanish children and young people based on the enKid study--cross-sectional study on a random national sample of the population aged 2-24 years--estimate a prevalence of obesity of 13.9% for the whole group. Geographical distribution draws a similar pattern to that described for adults. Higher peaks of the problem are identified between 9-13 years among boys from a low socioeconomical background. The analysis of determinants of obesity in Spanish children and young people show that overweight and obesity is related to absence of breastfeeding, low consumption of fruit and vegetables; high consumption of cakes and buns, soft drinks and butchery products, low physical activity levels and a positive association with time spent watching TV. The joint consensus document produced by the Spanish Association of Pediatrics (AEP), Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) and Spanish Society for the Study of Obesity (SEEDO) considers a global strategy for the prevention of obesity from early stages in life. The important role of the family and the school setting as well as the responsibility of the Health Administration and Pediatric care in the prevention of obesity is highlighted in the document.

AB The authors used social marketing to design and test advertisement components aimed at increasing students' interest in attending an alcohol program focused on reaching students who drink heavily, although the authors offered no such program. Participants were undergraduate students in introductory psychology courses (N = 551). Questionnaires included measures assessing demographic information, alcohol use and negative consequences, and interest in attending an alcohol program in response to exposure to 1 of 12 systematically varied advertisements. The authors found that approximately 20% of participants across all ad types indicated some level of interest in attending the alcohol program. Students who use alcohol reported more interest in attending when an informational message was used. Of the participants offered food, 41.9% indicated the food offered in the advertisement impacted their interest in attending. Results suggest market segmentation plays a role in developing effective advertisements to recruit different groups of students based on their reported drinking behavior.

AB There has been increasing interest in the developmental origins of substance use disorders (SUDs) in children and adolescents. Because of its early onset, high prevalence and known risk for SUD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a model developmental disorder to evaluate in context to SUDs. A selected review of the literature was undertaken examining ADHD as an antecedent disorder to subsequent SUD. ADHD and its co-occurring comorbid psychopathology increase the risk for cigarette smoking and SUD and is associated with greater SUD severity and chronicity. The treatment of ADHD appears to decrease the risk for cigarette smoking and SUD. ADHD is an important antecedent disorder in children and adolescents worthy of further targeted preventive efforts to diminish the risk for cigarette smoking and SUD.

AB OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to examine the prevalence, correlates, and consequences associated with simultaneous polydrug use and concurrent polydrug use of alcohol and prescription drugs. For purposes of this investigation, simultaneous polydrug use referred to the co-ingestion of different drugs at the same time, and concurrent polydrug use referred to the use of different drugs on separate occasions within the past 12 months.; METHOD: Undergraduate students attending a large public midwestern university in the United States were randomly selected to self-administer a Web survey. The sample consisted of 4,580 undergraduate students, with a mean (SD) age of 19.9 (2.0) years; the sample consisted of 50% women, and the racial breakdown was 65% white, 13% Asian, 7% black, 5% Hispanic, and 10% other race/ethnicity. The survey assessed simultaneous polydrug use and concurrent polydrug use of alcohol and four classes of prescription drugs: (1) pain medication, (2) stimulant medication, (3) sedative medication, and (4) sleeping medication.; RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence for polydrug use involving alcohol and abusable prescription drugs was 12.1% (including 6.9% simultaneous polydrug use). The majority of polydrug use involving alcohol and each class of prescription drugs was simultaneous polydrug use, with the exception of sleeping medication. Simultaneous polydrug use was more prevalent among undergraduate students who were male, were white, and reported early initiation of alcohol use. Simultaneous polydrug use was associated with more alcohol-related and other drug use-related problems than concurrent polydrug use.; CONCLUSIONS: Based on the high prevalence and increased risk for consequences associated with simultaneous polydrug use of alcohol and prescription drugs, collegiate prevention efforts aimed at reducing substance abuse should clearly focus on co-ingestion of alcohol and prescription drugs.

The questionnaire has thirty-nine questions referring to family structure, eating and drinking habits, preferences, life style parameters such as physical activity and television viewing.; RESULTS: The survey revealed a family unit of two children and their parents was the most common. Only a 12% of the children surveyed lived with their grandparents. Furthermore, the findings revealed a low family presence during the three main meals on the working days, which increased on weekends, 26% on breakfast, 44% on lunch and 11% on dinner. A 24% had breakfast alone and the 46% ate what they wanted. About the afternoon snack, the 25% alone and the 55% what they wanted. A 60% never or practically never participated in decision making, when buying food. A 70% reported they did other activities while eating. Concretely, a 40, 39 and 59% of the children reported they had breakfast, lunch and dinner while watching television. The consumption frequency of trinkets, soft drinks and television viewing were lower for the children from private compared to public schools.; CONCLUSIONS: This study show that food choice at shopping was mainly done by the parents, however, children had an important role in making decisions of what food they eat and the activities they do while eating. Therefore, pharmacists could have a potential role to intervene in the nutritional education to parents and children.

Universal, selective, and indicated prevention strategies are described for several populations including elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and medical settings. This paper primarily reviews individually focused alcohol prevention efforts in the United States (US), where harm reduction has been less well received in comparison to many European countries, Canada, and Australia. Zero-tolerance approaches continue to be the norm in individually focused prevention efforts in the US, especially amongst adolescents, despite research suggesting that harm reduction approaches can be effective. Moreover, existing evidence supports that harm reduction approaches show considerable promise in universal prevention and have become best practices in selective and indicated prevention contexts.

AB PURPOSE: To determine how the association between cigarette smoking and other risky behaviors, such as substance use, violence, and risky sexual practices, has changed between 1991 and 2003.; METHODS: Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) from 1991 to 2003 were analyzed. For each cohort, logistic regression models controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and school grade were used to describe the associations between smoking and other risky behaviors. Changes in the odds ratios over time were confirmed with a trend analysis.; RESULTS: The strength of the relationship between smoking and other risky behaviors increased for lifetime number of sexual partners (1991 odds ratio [OR] 1.49; 2003 OR 1.61 (p < .001)), sexual partners in the past 3 months (1991 OR 1.77; 2001 OR 2.05 (p < .001)), and never wearing a bicycle helmet 1991 OR 1.40; 1997 OR 5.94 (p < .001). Increases were also seen for binge drinking, and physical fighting. The association between cigarette smoking and marijuana use decreased slightly.; CONCLUSIONS: Future prevention efforts and tobacco intervention programs should recognize that current adolescent smokers are even more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, risky alcohol-related behaviors, and to not use a seatbelt or bicycle helmet than were adolescents in the early nineties.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate possible associations between social background, other aspects of childhood environment and induced abortion among young women.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: Norwegian girls (N = 2,198), comprising a representative sample, were followed up through three data collections from they were in their teens in 1992 till they were young adult women (20 - 27 years) seven years later. A questionnaire was used to collect the data and the analyses were conducted by Cox regression. The response rate for the first data collection was 97%. The cumulative response rate over all three data collections was 69 %.; RESULTS: In young adulthood we uncovered a steady reduction of induced abortion rates with increasing educational level. Women who had grown up in Northern Norway had higher rates than other women. There was a lower risk for induced abortion when parents were well educated and had fairly good jobs. Further, there were associations to parental divorce, weak parental monitoring and parental alcohol abuse.; INTERPRETATION: A host of socioeconomic factors are associated with abortion risk. We need more thorough knowledge about these factors. We can, however, conclude that preventive efforts in this area should be targeted towards groups with risk factors.

AB Although HIV information is widely available in this country, little is known about how commonly used HIV prevention activities reach persons at highest risk for HIV. In this paper, we describe the extent to which HIV prevention strategies reach a sample of high-risk persons and whether such exposure correlates with having been tested for HIV. Data are from the 2000 HIV Testing Survey, an anonymous interview study of men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users (IDU), and high-risk heterosexuals (HRH), recruited from appropriate venues in seven states and New York City. We report the proportion of persons exposed to three types of interventions: information (media messages, brochures), counseling or skills-building (group counseling, role play, calling an AIDS hotline), and prevention supplies (provision of condoms, bleach kits), stratified by HIV testing status (ever, never). Exposure to information interventions was high among 2491 respondents (85%-96%) and did not differ by testing status. Use of counseling or skills-building interventions varied by testing status for IDU (8% untested versus 41% tested, p < 0.01) and HRH (14% versus 20%, p = 0.03) but not MSM (15% versus 23%, p = 0.08). Among tested IDU, those receiving bleach kits were more likely to report consistent bleach use when injecting with nonsterile needles (25% versus 9%, p = 0.003). Exposure to HIV prevention information is high but exposure to counseling or skills-building interventions is less common and more prevalent among those previously tested. Prevention initiatives should focus on counseling and testing, skills-building, and prevention supplies.

AB OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of drinking, binge drinking (4 or more drinks), and alcohol abuse and dependence and to identify predictors of heavier drinking among women of child-bearing age (18-44 years).; METHODS: Subjects are part of a national multistage random sample from the 2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).; RESULTS: Binge drinking, abuse, and dependence are higher in younger (<30 years) pregnant and nonpregnant women. Among pregnant women, binge drinking is highest among Whites; alcohol abuse and dependence rates are relatively low and similar in all racial/ethnic groups. Among nonpregnant women, Whites and mixed race women have the highest rates of binge drinking. Alcohol abuse and dependence are highest among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, followed by Native American/Alaska Native women. Women who are White, younger (21-29 years), single, or cohabiting and with a higher income (> 40,000 US dollars) are at a higher risk for heavier drinking.; CONCLUSIONS: Drinking and heavier drinking remain at high levels among women of child-bearing age. Prevention efforts must be comprehensive and should target pregnant women who are drinking and those who could become pregnant and are drinking at high-risk levels.

AB OBJECTIVES: The RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center (RTI-UNC EPC) systematically reviewed the evidence on (a) the effectiveness of community- and population-based interventions to prevent tobacco use and to increase consumer demand for and implementation of effective cessation interventions; (b) the impacts of smokeless tobacco marketing on smoking, use of those products, and population harm; and (c) the directions for future research.; DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Applied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane libraries, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Psychological Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts from January 1980 through June 10, 2005. We included English-language randomized controlled trials, other trials, and observational studies, with sample size and follow-up restrictions. We used 13 Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews, 5 prior systematic reviews, and 2 meta-analyses as the foundation for this report.; REVIEW METHODS: Trained reviewers abstracted detailed data from included articles into evidence tables and completed quality assessments; other senior reviewers confirmed accuracy and resolved disagreements.; RESULTS: We identified 1,288 unique abstracts; 642 did not meet inclusion criteria, 156 overlapped with prior reviews, and 2 were not published articles. Of 488 full-text articles retrieved and reviewed, we excluded 298 for several reasons, marked 88 as background, and retained 102. Evidence (consistent with previous reviews) showed that (a) school-based prevention interventions have short-term (but not long-term) effects on adolescents; (b) multicomponent approaches, including telephone counseling, increase the number of users who attempt to quit; (c) self-help strategies alone are ineffective, but counseling and pharmacotherapy used either alone or in combination can improve success rates of quit attempts; and (d) provider training and academic detailing improve provider delivery of cessation treatments, but evidence is insufficient to show that these approaches yield higher quit rates. New evidence was insufficient to address the following: (a) effectiveness of population-based prevention interventions; (b) effectiveness of provider-based interventions to reduce tobacco initiation; (c) effectiveness of community- and provider-based interventions to increase use of proven cessation strategies; (d) effectiveness of marketing campaigns to switch tobacco users from smoking to smokeless tobacco products; and (e) effectiveness of interventions in populations with comorbidities and risk behaviors (e.g., depression, substance and alcohol abuse). No evidence was available on the way in which smokeless tobacco product marketing affects population harm.; CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base has notable gaps and numerous study deficiencies. We found little information to address some of the issues that previous authoritative reviews had not covered, some information to substantiate earlier conclusions and recommendations from those reviews, and no evidence that would overturn any previous recommendations.

AB This study investigates the effects of alcohol advertising on adolescent alcohol consumption. The theory of an industry response function and evidence from prior studies indicate the importance of maximizing the variance in advertising measures. Monitoring the Future (MTF) and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) data are augmented with alcohol advertising, originating on the market level, for five media. The large sample of the MTF allows estimation of race and gender-specific models. The longitudinal nature of the NLSY97 allows controls for unobserved heterogeneity with state-level and individual fixed effects. Price and advertising effects are generally larger for females relative to males. Controls for individual heterogeneity yield larger advertising effects, implying that the MTF results may understate the effects of alcohol advertising. Results from the NLSY97 suggest that a 28% reduction in alcohol advertising would reduce adolescent monthly alcohol participation from 25% to between 24 and 21%. For binge participation, the reduction would be from 12% to between 11 and 8%. The past month price-participation elasticity is estimated at -0.26, consistent with prior studies. The results show that reduction of alcohol advertising can produce a modest decline in adolescent alcohol consumption, though effects may vary by race and gender.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between behavioural factors, body adiposity and muscle mass.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 1415 Italian individuals (705 men and 710 women) aged 40-74 years from a population-based survey carried out in the town of Bollate (Milan). Analysis of covariance was used to refine and improve the precision of the comparisons.; RESULTS: Men: Smoking and sedentary behaviour were related to larger waist circumference (WC) and smaller hip circumference (HC). Increased WC was also associated with high-fat diet and moderate-to-heavy drinking (compared to light drinkers). Those more educated (completed high school) were leaner and ex-smokers had higher body mass index (BMI) than non-smokers. Women: BMI was inversely related with education, the more educated having also lower muscle mass. The light drinkers were leaner and moderate-to-heavy drinkers had less muscle mass than abstainers. Moderate-to-heavy drinkers had larger WC than light drinkers. A strong negative trend was found in the relationship between dietary fibre and WC. Overall adiposity (BMI) and, more weakly, HC and peripheral subcutaneous fat increased with more TV watching, whereas BMI lowered, together with WC and muscle mass (as measured by the mid-arm circumference), with more walking/cycling.; CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable habits such as smoking (men) and moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinking are associated with a pattern that is particularly deleterious to health: increased intra-abdominal fat and less muscle mass. Prevention strategies should be simultaneously aimed at promoting physical activities and reducing sedentary behaviours. A low-fat, fibre-rich diet seems to be closely related to a healthy distribution of body fat.

AB This study used a three-wave panel design (N = 119 complete cases for all waves) to test for social influence and selection in the relation of college students' heavy drinking and that of their social networks. Evidence emerged for both social influence and selection, leading the authors to probe more specialized issues related to each. Results regarding social influence revealed, further, that greater presence in the network of individuals that the focal respondent considered "drinking buddies" was predictive of one's own later drinking, controlling for potential confounds. Network demographic characteristics associated with a "risky" (i.e., heavy-drinking) network also were documented. An additional finding, important for selection, was that wave-to-wave change in average network drinking appeared to result primarily from network members with different drinking levels being added to and dropped from the network. Findings are discussed in the context of the recent renaissance in social-network research.

AB Alcohol use occurs in the context of multiple goals that college students develop, pursue, and modify in their transition to adulthood. Consequently, the assessment of goal constructs provides a valuable tool for understanding the developmental context of college drinking. Conceptualizing student alcohol misuse in terms of its effects on valued goals has a number of advantages for understanding personality risk and protective factors, clarifying the contributions of social and environmental influences, and developing motivation-based interventions.

AB Intrauterine growth retardation and preterm birth are more frequent in African-American women and women of lower socio-economic status, but the reasons for these disparities are not fully understood. The physical and social environments in which these women live may contribute to these disparities. We conducted a multilevel study to explore whether conditions of mothers' neighbourhood of residence contribute to adverse birth outcomes independent of individual-level determinants. We analysed data from 105 111 births in 1015 census tracts in Louisiana during 1997-98, merging it with data from other existing sources on neighbourhood socio-economic status, neighbourhood physical deterioration, and neighbourhood density of retail outlets selling tobacco, alcohol and foods. After controlling for individual-level sociodemographic factors, tract-level median household income was positively associated with both birthweight-for-gestational-age and gestational age at birth. Neighbourhood physical deterioration was associated with these birth outcomes in ecological analyses but only inconsistently associated with them after controlling for individual-level factors. Neither gestational age nor birthweight-for-gestational-age was associated with the neighbourhood density of alcohol outlets, tobacco outlets, fast-food restaurants or grocery supermarkets. We conclude that measures of neighbourhood economic conditions are associated with both fetal growth and the length of gestation independent of individual-level factors, but that readily available measures of neighbourhood retail outlets are not. Additional studies are needed to better understand the nature of environmental influences on birth outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Sports sponsorship is a significant marketing tool. As such, it can promote products that pose risks to health (eg, high fat and high sugar foods) or it can promote health-supporting products (eg, sporting equipment and services). However, there is a lack of data on the proportion of sponsorship associated with "unhealthy" and "healthy" products and no methodology for systematically assessing it. This research aimed to explore this proportion with an Internet survey of sports sponsorship in the New Zealand setting.; METHODS: A search methodology was developed to identify Internet-based evidence of sports sponsorship at the national level and at the regional and club level in one specific region (Wellington). The top eight sports for 5-17-year-olds were selected and products and services of sponsors were classified in terms of potential public health impact (using a conservative approach).; RESULTS: Sponsorship of these popular sports was common at the national, regional and club levels (640 sponsors listed on 107 websites overall). Sports sponsorship associated with sponsors' products classified as "unhealthy" (eg, food high in fat and sugar, gambling and alcohol) were over twice as common as sponsorship associated with sponsors' products classified as "healthy" (32.7% (95% CI = 29.1, 36.5) versus 15.5% (95% CI = 12.8, 18.6) respectively). "Gambling" was the most common specific type of sponsorship (18.8%) followed by alcohol (11.3%). There were significantly more "alcohol" sponsors for rugby, compared to all the other sports collectively (rate ratio (RR) = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.60, 3.79), and for top male sports compared to female (RR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.05, 3.18). Also there was significantly more "unhealthy food" sponsorship for touch rugby and for "junior" teams/clubs compared to other sports collectively (RR = 6.54; 95% CI = 2.07, 20.69; and RR = 14.72, 95% CI = 6.22, 34.8; respectively). A validation study gave an inter-rater reliability for number of sponsors of 95% (n = 87 sponsors), and an inter-rater reliability of classification and categorisation of 100%.; CONCLUSION: This study found that the sponsorship of popular sports for young people is dominated by "unhealthy" sponsorship (ie, predominantly gambling, alcohol and unhealthy food) relative to "healthy" sponsorship. Governments may need to consider regulations that limit unhealthy sponsorship and/or adopt alternative funding mechanisms for supporting popular sports.

AB BACKGROUND: The alcohol industry spends over $5 billion a year on marketing, much of which is accessible to children. The distribution of branded articles of clothing and other personal items is one aspect of alcohol marketing that has not been adequately studied. In this study, the prevalence of ownership of alcohol-branded merchandise (ABM) was determined in a sample of rural northern New England adolescents, and the relationship between ownership of such items and initiation of alcohol use was examined.; DESIGN/METHODS: Northern New England middle school students who had not yet initiated alcohol use were captured at baseline in a 1999 school-based survey, and ownership of an ABM item and initiation of alcohol use were determined 1 to 2 years later by telephone. The analysis controlled for demographics (gender, grade in school); characteristics of the child (school performance, sensation seeking, rebelliousness); parenting style; and peer alcohol use.; RESULTS: Of 2406 baseline never-drinkers, 15% had initiated alcohol use and 14% owned an ABM item by follow-up. ABM items consisted primarily of articles of clothing such as t-shirts and hats. ABM ownership was associated with higher grade in school, male gender, exposure to peer drinking, having tried smoking, poorer academic performance, higher levels of sensation seeking and rebelliousness, and less-responsive and restrictive parenting styles. Owners of ABM items at follow-up had higher rates of alcohol initiation compared with non-owners (25.5% vs 13.1%, respectively, p<0.001). After adjusting for the above confounders, students who owned an ABM item were significantly more likely to have initiated alcohol use compared with students who did not own one (adjusted odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0).; CONCLUSIONS: In this northern New England adolescent sample, ownership of alcohol-branded merchandise was prevalent and exhibited an independent cross-sectional association with onset of adolescent drinking. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the relationship is causal, and whether teen use of ABM items influences peer drinking norms and behavior.

AB CONTEXT: There is much to be learned about why some adolescents progress to a regular smoking habit and others do not.; OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether (1) team sport participation buffers the effect of having 2 smoking risk genotypes (the dopamine reuptake transporter [SLC6A3] and the dopamine D(2) receptor [DRD2]) or 1 of these risk genotypes vs having none on adolescent smoking progression and (2) the buffering effects of team sports were due to physical activity associated with team sport participation.; DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. Survey data were collected annually from grade 9 to the end of grade 12. Self-report measures included smoking, team sport participation, physical activity, depression, smoking exposure, and alcohol and marijuana use. DNA was collected via buccal swabs. Data were analyzed using latent growth modeling.; SETTING: Five public high schools in Virginia.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 361 students of European ancestry. Main Outcome Measure Smoking progression.; RESULTS: For adolescents participating in at least 1 team sport, but not for adolescents with no team sport participation, physical activity had a significant negative effect on smoking progression (z = -3.85, P<.001; chi(2)(1,N = 361) = 6.73, P = .009). In addition, having 1 (z = 2.69; P = .007) and 2 (z = 2.22; P = .03) smoking risk genotypes had a positive effect on physical activity. These represented significant between-group effects (chi(2)(1,N = 361) = 6.29, P = .01; chi(2)(1,N = 361) = 3.81, P = .05, respectively). Thus, having 1 or more smoking risk genotypes was related to higher levels of physical activity, which, in turn, was related to lower levels of smoking progression for adolescents participating in at least 1 team sport but not for adolescents with no team sport participation.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of an interaction between environmental influences and specific genes on adolescent smoking and may promote an understanding of important protective relationships in the environment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the number of food advertisements African American children are exposed to during children's television programming aired on predominantly African American and general television stations.; DESIGN: A content analysis was conducted to identify and analyze the health-related content (HRC) and physical activity-related content (PARC) of food advertisements shown during children's television programming.; SETTING: Three sets of television advertisements from 3 stations (Black Entertainment Television, The WB [Warner Bros], and Disney Channel) served as the sample during a 1-week period in July 2005 (July 11-15), from 3 pm to 9 pm.; RESULTS: In total, 1098 advertisements were recorded, with 256 food and beverage commercials used for this study. Results indicate that 36.3% of all commercials were based on fast food restaurants, 31.3% were for drinks, 16.8% were for candy, 13.7% were for cereals, and 2.0% were for snacks (percentages do not total 100 because of rounding). Compared with The WB and Disney Channel, Black Entertainment Television had significantly (P=.001) more food and beverage advertisements. Few HRC or PARC advertisements were shown. Of 256 food and beverage commercials, only 8.2% contained HRC and 9.4% had PARC. Also, the HRC and PARC scenes contained messages that were implied vs explicitly talking about the health or physical benefits of the product.; CONCLUSIONS: African American children are overexposed to numerous types of food and beverage advertisements. These advertisements do not provide an adequate level of positive HRC and PARC messages. Consequently, the messages that are portrayed may undermine efforts to teach African American children about the importance of healthy living and physical activity.

AB AIM: To compare health behavior patterns of adolescents in Lithuania with health behavior of adolescents in European Union (EU) in 2001/2002.; METHODS: The study was carried out in conformity with the methodology of Health Behavior in School-aged Children: a World Health Organization cross-national study. Three country representative samples of schoolchildren, aged 11, 13, and 15, were surveyed in 25 EU countries and regions in 2001/2002 school year. The study instrument was a standardized questionnaire that included questions on alcohol consumption, smoking, illegal drugs use, physical activity, and other patterns of health behavior. The rate or mean values of the targeted health behavior of Lithuanian students were assessed and compared to those calculated as an average for the EU countries and regions.; RESULTS: We found an early onset of alcohol consumption among Lithuanian boys. Lithuanian boys and girls across all age groups reported being drunk two and more times more often than their peers from other EU member states. Lithuanian 15-year-old boys smoked more often that did their European peers, while girls smoke more rarely. The prevalence of drugs (marihuana group) use among Lithuanian students is relatively low: the prevalence of drug use among 15-year-olds in Lithuania is two times lower than the prevalence in other EU countries and regions (11.2% vs 24.5% for boys and 4.5% vs 18.3% for girls, respectively). Physical activity of Lithuanian adolescents is rather high in comparison with their EU peers, although many students watch television for > or =4 hours a day. Lithuanian students did not eat sweets often, or drank soft drinks (Coca Cola and other), and they ate fruits and had breakfast every school day. With respect to hygienic habits, approximately only one in 3 boys and every second girl brushed their teeth more than once a day.; CONCLUSIONS: There are health behavior differences between adolescents in Lithuania and those in other EU countries. The disparities among health behavior of young people in EU countries and regions require Lithuanian and EU health policy to develop initiatives aimed at decreasing health behavior inequalities.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine which factors are associated with use of atomoxetine (ATX) relative to stimulant medications (STIMs) for treatment initiation in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A similar exploratory analysis of the use of ATX versus STIMs in children has been published previously.; METHODS: This was an exploratory analysis using a retrospective observational cohort design applied to administrative pharmacy and medical claims from an integrated managed care database. Patients were identified if they had at least 1 administrative claim with a diagnosis for ADHD. Treatment .initiation. was defined as a new prescription for an ADHD medication preceded by 3 months without similar therapy. Two separate analyses were done, one comparing medication starts for ATX with those of any STIM, the other comparing starts of ATX with long-acting stimulants (LA-STIMs). Logistic regression analyses of prior-year administrative claims were used to compare the frequencies of differential predictors of the use of medication.; RESULTS: There were 10,359 patients aged >18 years who initiated ATX or a STIM between April and December of 2003 and had at least 1 claim with a diagnosis for ADHD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 314.0x). Approximately one third (28 of 82) of the comparisons related to patient demographics, diagnostic history, and previous treatment history was found to be related to the use of ATX versus STIMs and/or LA-STIMs. Patients were more likely to have received ATX than a STIM if they had prior diagnoses of bipolar disorder (odds ratio [OR] 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.87), alcohol dependence (OR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.26-2.58), anxiety (OR 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.40), previous use of antipsychotic medication (OR 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22-1.96), or previous antidepressant use (OR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28). Prior use of behavioral services greater than 12 visits was associated with the use of ATX relative to STIMs (OR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.20-1.77) but not for ATX relative to LA-STIMs. Conversely, ATX was used less often than STIMs for initiation in younger adults aged 18 to 24 years (OR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.74), female patients (OR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.80-0.99), patients with personality disorders (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34-0.82), and those with prior use of STIMs (OR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.69). The majority of comparisons (54 of 82) related to demographics, diagnostic history, and previous treatment history did not show statistically significant associations.; CONCLUSIONS: During the first year of ATX.s market introduction, some differences in the frequency of various clinical factors were found in adults treated with ATX compared with those patients who received STIMs. This association may suggest that STIMs and ATX are used to address different treatment needs in adults with ADHD. Future studies will need to determine the significance of the practice pattern differences inferred here and if they persist after ATX has been on the market longer.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine whether novelty seeking and depressive symptoms had mediated or indirect effects on adolescent smoking progression through tobacco advertising receptivity.; METHODS: More than 1000 adolescents were monitored from 9th grade to 12th grade and completed annual surveys that measured demographic characteristics, smoking behavior, tobacco advertising receptivity, novelty-seeking personality, depressive symptoms, family and peer smoking, alcohol use, and marijuana use.; RESULTS: Latent growth modeling indicated that novelty seeking had a significant indirect effect on smoking progression through baseline tobacco advertising receptivity. For each 1-SD increase in novelty seeking, the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie, being in a specific category or higher), which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade. The indirect effect from depressive symptoms to smoking progression did not reach significance.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings may inform future research on other factors that influence tobacco advertising receptivity, as well as programs aimed at preventing adolescent smoking initiation and progression.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about how physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and various adolescent health risk behaviors are associated. The objective of this study was to examine relationships between PA and sedentary behavior patterns and an array of risk behaviors, including leading causes of adolescent morbidity/mortality.; METHODS: Nationally representative self-reported data were collected (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; wave I: 1994-1995; II: 1996; N = 11957). Previously developed and validated cluster analyses identified 7 homogeneous groups of adolescents sharing PA and sedentary behaviors. Poisson regression predicted the relative risk of health risk behaviors, other weekly activities, and self-esteem across the 7 PA/sedentary behavior clusters controlling for demographics and socioeconomic status. Main outcome measures were adolescent risk behaviors (eg, truancy, cigarette smoking, sexual intercourse, delinquency), other weekly activities (eg, work, academic performance, sleep), self-esteem.; RESULTS: Relative to high television (TV) and video viewers, adolescents in clusters characterized by skating and video gaming, high overall sports and sports participation with parents, using neighborhood recreation center, strict parental control of TV, reporting few activities overall, and being active in school were less likely to participate in a range of risky behaviors, ranging from an adjusted risk ratio (ARR) of 0.42 (outcome: illegal drug use, cluster: strict parental control of TV) to 0.88 (outcome: violence, cluster: sports with parents). Active teens were less likely to have low self-esteem (eg, adolescents engaging in sports with parents, ARR: 0.73) and more likely to have higher grades (eg, active in school, ARR: 1.20).; CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a range of PA-related behaviors, particularly those characterized by high parental sports/exercise involvement, was associated with favorable adolescent risk profiles. Adolescents with high TV/video viewership were less likely to have positive risk behavior outcomes. Enhancing opportunities for PA and sport may have a beneficial effect on leading adolescent risk behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Several environmental factors influence adolescents' food habits and television (TV) viewing is thought to be one of these factors. The purpose of the present study was to describe sociodemographic differences in TV viewing and to examine associations of TV viewing with the consumption of sweets, soft drinks, fruit and vegetables in different countries.; METHODS: Data were collected from 162,305 young people completing the 2001/02 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey, a World Health Organization cross-national study on health and health behaviours among 11-, 13- and 15-year-old school pupils. Analyses of variance were used to examine sociodemographic differences in TV viewing and logistic regression analyses to examine associations between TV viewing and food habits.; RESULTS: Large differences were found between countries in reported daily TV viewing time, from an average of 2.0 h in Switzerland to 3.7 h in Ukraine. The results indicate that those most likely to watch TV are boys, 13-year-olds and pupils of lower socio-economic status. Those who watched more TV were more likely to consume sweets and soft drinks on a daily basis and less likely to consume fruit and vegetables daily, although the latter associations were not so apparent among Central and Eastern European countries.; CONCLUSIONS: Given the high TV viewing rates among adolescents and the association with less healthy food options, many young people are at increased risk of overweight or obesity. Interventions to modify TV viewing behaviour are needed. The findings underscore the importance of tackling socio-economic differences.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate, using an information processing model, how persuasive media messages for alcohol use lead to concurring beliefs and behaviors among youths.; METHODS: Data were collected in 2000-2001 using computer-assisted, self-administered interviews with youths aged 9-17 years (n = 652).; RESULTS: Latent variable structural equations models showed that skepticism was negatively associated with positive affect toward alcohol portrayals and positively with the desire to emulate characters portrayed in alcohol advertisements. These, in turn, predicted expectancies and liking of/desire for beer toys and brands, which predicted alcohol use. Parental guidance decreased alcohol use directly and indirectly by lessening influences of positive affect toward advertising.; CONCLUSIONS: Media alcohol portrayals influence children's drinking through a progressive decision-making process, with its influence underestimated by typical exposure-and-effects analyses.

AB PURPOSE: Alcohol is the most common and frequently used drug and has the potential to cause multiple deleterious effects throughout the lifespan. Because early age at initiation of alcohol use increases this potential and programs and laws are in place to attempt to delay the onset of alcohol use, we studied the relationship between multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and both the likelihood of ever drinking and the age at initiating alcohol use.; METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 8417 adult health maintenance organization (HMO) members in California who completed a survey about ACEs, which included childhood abuse and neglect, growing up with various forms of household dysfunction and alcohol use in adolescence and adulthood. The main outcomes measured were ever drinking and age at initiating alcohol use among ever-drinkers for four age categories: < or = 14 years (early adolescence), 15 to 17 years (mid adolescence), and 18 to 20 years (late adolescence); age > or = 21 years was the referent. The relationship between the total number of adverse childhood experiences (ACE score) and early initiation of alcohol use (< or =14 years) among four birth cohorts dating back to 1900 was also examined.; RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of the cohort reported ever drinking; all individual ACEs except physical neglect increased the risk of ever using alcohol (p < .05). Among ever drinkers, initiating alcohol use by age 14 years was increased two- to threefold by individual ACEs (p < .05). ACEs also accounted for a 20% to 70% increased likelihood of alcohol use initiated during mid adolescence (15-17 years). The total number of ACEs (ACE score) had a very strong graded relationship to initiating alcohol use during early adolescence and a robust but somewhat less strong relationship to initiation during mid adolescence. For each of the four birth cohorts, the ACE score had a strong, graded relationship to initiating alcohol use by age 14 years (p < .05).; CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences are strongly related to ever drinking alcohol and to alcohol initiation in early and mid adolescence, and the ACE score had a graded or "dose-response" relationship to these alcohol use behaviors. The persistent graded relationship between the ACE score and initiation of alcohol use by age 14 for four successive birth cohorts dating back to 1900 suggests that the stressful effects of ACEs transcend secular changes, including the increased availability of alcohol, alcohol advertising, and the recent campaigns and health education programs to prevent alcohol use. These findings strongly suggest that efforts to delay the age of onset of drinking must recognize the contribution of multiple traumatic and stressful events to alcohol-seeking behavior among children and adolescents.

AB AIMS: To consider the effects of alcohol prohibition and police presence upon serious injury in isolated Alaska Native villages.; DESIGN: We compared rates of injury attributed to assault, self-harm, motor vehicle collisions and 'other causes' between villages with or without local prohibition and between villages with or without local police. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the relative effects of prohibition and police presence upon serious injury rates net of potential confounders.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 132 isolated Alaska Native villages between the years 1991 through 2000. MEASUREMENTS; Serious injury was measured using Alaska Trauma Registry and Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics death certificate records. Local option election records were used to classify cases as occurring in wet or dry villages and police deployment records were used to classify cases as occurring in villages with or without local police. Village-level statistics from the 1990 and 2000 US censuses were used in the negative binomial regression analyses.; FINDINGS: Villages that prohibited alcohol had lower age-adjusted rates of serious injury resulting from assault, motor vehicle collisions and 'other causes'. Dry villages with a local police presence had a lower age-adjusted rate of serious injury caused by assault. Controlling for the relative effects of village isolation, access to alcohol markets and local demographic structures, local prohibition was associated with lower rates of assault injuries and 'other causes' injuries while local police presence was associated with lower rates of assault injuries.; CONCLUSIONS: Residents of isolated Alaska Native villages are safer when they prohibit alcohol. A local police presence in dry villages provides further reduction of the incidence of assault.

AB BACKGROUND: The etiology of alcoholism and alcohol abuse, like many other complex diseases, is heterogeneous and multifactorial. Numerous studies demonstrate a genetic contribution to variation in the expression of alcohol-related disorders in humans. Over the past decade, nonhuman primates have emerged as a valuable model for some aspects of human alcohol abuse because of their phylogenetic proximity to humans. Long-term, longitudinal studies of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) have provided much insight into environmental influences, especially early life experiences, on alcohol consumption and behavior patterns that characterize alcohol intake later in life. It is not known, however, whether there is a genetic component as well to the variation seen in alcohol consumption in rhesus macaques. A significant genetic component to variation in alcohol consumption in rhesus macaques would show for the first time that like humans, for nonhuman primates additive genetic influences are important. Moreover, their use as a model for alcohol-related disorders in humans would have even greater relevance and utility for designing experiments incorporating the expanding molecular genetics field, and allow researchers to investigate the interaction among the known environmental influences and various genotypes.; METHODS: In this study, we investigate factors contributing to variation in alcohol consumption of 156 rhesus macaques collected over 10 years when subjects were adolescent in age, belonging to a single extended pedigree, with each cohort receiving identical early rearing backgrounds and subsequent treatments. To measure alcohol consumption each animal was provided unfettered simultaneous access both to an aspartame-sweetened 8.4% (v/v) alcohol-water solution, the aspartame-sweetened vehicle, and to water for 1 hour each day during the early afternoon between 13:00 and 15:00 in their home cages for a period of 5 to 7 weeks. We use multiple regression to identify factors that significantly affect alcohol consumption among these animals and a maximum likelihood program (ASReml) that, controlling for the significant factors, estimates the genetic contribution to the variance in alcohol consumption.; RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis identified test cohort and rearing environment as contributing to 57 and 2%, respectively, of the total variance in alcohol consumption. Of the remaining 41% of the variance about half (19.8%) was attributable to additive genetic effects using a maximum likelihood program.; CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that, as in humans, there are additive genetic factors that contribute to variation in alcohol consumption in rhesus macaques, with other nongenetic factors accounting for substantial portions of the variance in alcohol consumption, Our findings show the presence of an additive genetic component and suggest the potential utility of the nonhuman primate as a molecular genetics tool for understanding alcohol abuse and alcoholism.

AB Spain presents one of the lowest suicide rates (8.7 per 100,000) but, as well as Ireland, it has also experienced one of the highest rate increases both within Europe and within the world. In our country, it can be observed an increase in the suicide rates from 1975 to 1994, being this increase greater in men than in women. It can also be noted that there was a stabilisation in the following years. Social factors, specially those which have to deal with gender roles and changes in these roles, are the most common explanations. Another possible explanation for the observed increase in mortality due to suicide among young men could be the AIDS epidemic and intravenous drug addiction, that was observed in Spain during the eighties and nineties. Furthermore, we are witnessing an epidemic related to violence against children and women. Literature strongly suggests that child abuse (psychological and sexual) is associated with increased suicide risk in adolescent or adult life. Women experience violence from their intimate partners and have a greater risk of suffering from chronic pain, diverse somatisations, greater substance use like drugs and alcohol, depression and suicide attempt. The association between work precariousness and suicide seems to be due to economic and social and family support factors, which can lead to greater vulnerability to mental health problems. These factors are of great relevance, since Spain presents one of the highest unemployment and temporary employment rates in the European Union. It seems reasonable that, due to the individualism that characterises the contemporary society, its demands and the new role of women in the work market that cause, among others, a greater difficulty in combining work and family life, are factors that could explain the lack of decrease in suicide rates.

AB CONTEXT: Iran's culture and religion prohibit sexual contact prior to marriage. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, little is known about the sexual activity of unmarried adolescent males or about their knowledge of, and attitudes toward, sexuality and reproductive health.; METHODS: A population-based study of 1,385 males aged 15-18 in Tehran was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were questioned about their beliefs and knowledge regarding reproductive health, and asked whether they had engaged in sexual activity. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with sexual knowledge, attitudes and behavior.; RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of the sample reported having engaged in sexual activity. Sexual experience was associated with older age, access to satellite television, alcohol consumption and permissive attitudes toward sex. Substantial proportions of respondents held misconceptions regarding condoms, STIs and reproductive physiology. Attitudes toward premarital sex were more permissive among respondents who were older, were not in school, had work experience, had access to the Internet or satellite television, lived separately from their parents, or reported having used alcohol, cigarettes or drugs.; CONCLUSION: The relatively high prevalence of sexual activity and the lack of knowledge regarding STIs and contraceptives pose a significant threat to the sexual and reproductive health of adolescent males in Iran. Programs are needed to provide adolescents with the information and skills to make safe sexual decisions.

AB The possible mechanisms involved in continuities and discontinuities in psychopathology between childhood and adult life are considered in relation to the findings from systematic, prospective, long-term longitudinal studies. Findings on schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental disorders, emotional disturbances, antisocial behaviour and substance abuse are used as conditions illustrating the key issues. The overarching themes are then discussed in relation to heterotypic continuity and psychopathologic progression, early age at onset and a range of possible mediating mechanisms - including genetic mediation, 'kindling' effects, environmental influences, coping mechanisms and cognitive processing of experiences. Some of the key research challenges that remain concern the testing of competing hypotheses on mediating processes, the changes involved in adolescence, the transition from prodromal phase to overt schizophrenia and the emergence of adolescent-limited antisocial behaviour. Greater use needs to be made of genetic research strategies and of the testing of possible cognitive processing mediation effects.

AB Young adults and young women in particular are drinking more alcohol than ever before, with implications for risky behaviours and long-term health. This study explored the ways in which alcohol and drinking were represented in six monthly UK magazines (three targeted at young men, three at young women) across a three-month period (18 magazines). We identified three main discourses across the texts, namely the drug alcohol; masculinity and machismo; and drinking as normality. These discourses constructed women's and men's drinks and drinking behaviours in sharp contrast. Drinking was aligned with traditional masculine images, although new kinds of drinks were aligned with traditional feminine images--and derided in men's magazines. Findings highlight how gender, constructed in relation to the other, is an important aspect of representations of drinking patterns in young adults.

AB OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this article is to assess young drivers' gender differences in the associations between substance use/environmental influences and high-risk driving behavior.; METHOD: We determine the association of 12th-grade self-reported substance use/ environmental influences with high-risk driving behavior as quantified by the number of offenses, serious offenses, crashes, and single-vehicle crashes on state driving records during subjects' (N = 3,607; 51% male) first 4 years of licensure.; RESULTS: The associations between high-risk driving and substance use/environmental influences were generally stronger among women than among men. When matched by substance-use profiles, women had fewer risky-driving incidents than men.; CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that young women who exhibit high-risk driving behavior deviate more from the general population of young women with respect to alcohol use, alcohol misuse, and marijuana use than high-risk-driving young men differ from other young men. In addition, findings indicate that even if young men and women were to eventually have equal levels of substance use, women would likely retain their lower-risk driving profiles. These findings suggest the need for (1) future research to understand the differential associations, and (2) prevention programs that consider these gender differences.

AB OBJECTIVE: Harmful alcohol consumption is a leading cause of death in the United States. The majority of people who die from alcohol use begin drinking in their youth. In this study, we estimate the impact of interventions to reduce the prevalence of drinking among youth on subsequent drinking patterns and alcohol-attributable mortality.; METHOD: We first estimated the effect of public health interventions to decrease harmful drinking among youth from literature reviews and used life table methods to estimate alcohol-attributable years of life lost by age 80 years among the cohort of approximately 4 million U.S. residents aged 20 in the year 2000. Then, from national survey data on transitions in drinking habits by age, we modeled the impact of interventions on alcohol-attributable mortality.; RESULTS: A tax increase and an advertising ban were the most effective interventions identified. In the absence of intervention, there would be 55,259 alcohol-attributable deaths over the lifetime of the cohort. A tax-based 17% increase in the price of alcohol of dollar 1 per six pack of beer could reduce deaths from harmful drinking by 1,490, equivalent to 31,130 discounted years of potential life saved or 3.3% of current alcohol-attributable mortality. A complete ban on alcohol advertising would reduce deaths from harmful drinking by 7,609 and result in a 16.4% decrease in alcohol-related life-years lost. A partial advertising ban would result in a 4% reduction in alcohol-related life-years lost.; CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to prevent harmful drinking by youth can result in reductions in adult mortality. Among interventions shown to be successful in reducing youthful drinking prevalence, advertising bans appear to have the greatest potential for premature mortality reduction.

AB Ergogenic drugs are substances that are used to enhance athletic performance. These drugs include illicit substances as well as compounds that are marketed as nutritional supplements. Many such drugs have been used widely by professional and elite athletes for several decades. However, in recent years, research indicates that younger athletes are increasingly experimenting with these drugs to improve both appearance and athletic abilities. Ergogenic drugs that are commonly used by youths today include anabolic-androgenic steroids, steroid precursors (androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone), growth hormone, creatine, and ephedra alkaloids. Reviewing the literature to date, it is clear that children are exposed to these substances at younger ages than in years past, with use starting as early as middle school. Anabolic steroids and creatine do offer potential gains in body mass and strength but risk adverse effects to multiple organ systems. Steroid precursors, growth hormone, and ephedra alkaloids have not been proven to enhance any athletic measures, whereas they do impart many risks to their users. To combat this drug abuse, there have been recent changes in the legal status of several substances, changes in the rules of youth athletics including drug testing of high school students, and educational initiatives designed for the young athlete. This article summarizes the current literature regarding these ergogenic substances and details their use, effects, risks, and legal standing.

AB BACKGROUND: Rapid economic development accompanied by imported Western media, advertising, fashion, and lifestyle in mainland China has resulted in shifts in cultural beliefs and beauty ideals in adolescents. The present study focused on understanding relationships among weight perception and weight-related sociocultural and behavioral factors in Chinese adolescents.; METHODS: Data collected in 2002 from 6863 middle and high school students and their parents from four large cities in mainland China were used. Weight status was determined by measured weight and height. Weight perception, media exposure, attitudes, and health behaviors were assessed by a structured questionnaire survey.; RESULTS: Boys were more likely to describe themselves as either too thin or relatively thin than girls (37.32% vs. 18.79%), while girls more often considered themselves either relatively heavy or too heavy than boys (50.83% vs. 26.54%). Girls who were actually normal or underweight were more likely than boys to describe themselves as either relatively heavy or very heavy (41.6% vs. 11.6%), while boys who were actually normal or overweight were more likely than girls to believe themselves as underweight (30.9% vs. 15.7%). Girls who were frequently exposed to media from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and placed high value on their physical appearance, were more likely to be dissatisfied with their body weight, which in turn were more likely to restrict consumption of certain foods, smoke cigarettes, and drink alcohol. Similar results were not observed in boys.; CONCLUSIONS: Weight dissatisfaction was prevalent in Chinese adolescents and was significantly related to media exposure, attitudes towards physical appearance, and adoption of certain health-risk behaviors in girls. Our findings underscore the importance of sociocultural influences in shaping realistic body image and have implications for prevention and early intervention for establishing health behavioral practices during adolescence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To integrate routine HIV testing into the services offered at a public health department STD clinic and document the rate of acceptance and rate of test positivity during the first 18 months.; METHODS: Testing for HIV was added to the array of tests offered to all patients at the Maricopa County STD clinic. Patients were informed of this new option at registration and were provided with a consent form and instructions to read the form and sign it, unless they did not desire testing. STD clinicians were responsible for insuring that questions regarding testing were answered and that consent forms were signed. HIV prevention was integrated into the general STD preventive messages during the clinical encounter.; RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of patients accepted testing (12,176 of 17,875). Of these, 68 were HIV-positive, for a rate of 5.6 per 1,000. The positive rate for men was 8.6/1000 and for women 1.2/1,000. The rate for men who reported having sex with men (MSM) was 63.8/1,000. Fourteen of the HIV-positive MSM were co-infected with syphilis. Of the 68 who were HIV-positive, 58 (85.3%) were successfully located, informed of their test results, and referred for HIV treatment and support services.; CONCLUSIONS: HIV testing can be included in the routine battery of tests offered at an STD clinic with high patient acceptance. Routine testing can discover those who are unaware of their HIV-positive status, providing an opportunity for early referral for treatment, counseling to avoid disease transmission, and notification of sexual contacts.

AB PURPOSE: This study tested event-level associations between substance use and condom use, as well as potential covariates, among adolescents with substance use disorders (SUDs).; METHODS: A total of 134 adolescents (age, 15-21 y), 72% with SUDs, participated in telephone diary data collection of sexual events over a 6-week period. Effects on condom use of event-level substance use, partner type, salience of costs associated with unprotected sex, and subject-level SUD and sensation-seeking were tested in random intercept logistic regression models. A total of 637 sexual events were available for analysis.; RESULTS: Event-level alcohol and drug use as well as subject-level SUD and sensation-seeking were not associated with condom use in multivariate models. However, all other event-level measures were significant, including an interaction between partner type and salience of preventing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The importance of preventing AIDS was associated only with condom use with regular partners. Prevention of pregnancy was associated with condom use independent of partner type.; CONCLUSIONS: As in other event-level studies, substance use was not related to condom use in our study. Novel results in our study showed that the salience of preventing negative outcomes is a significant predictor of condom use even in the context of event-level substance use and partner type. These results suggest that prevention efforts for substance-using youth should not focus on preventing substance use as a way to prevent unsafe sex, but should emphasize the potential costs of unsafe sex even with known partners.

AB This study tests the impact of an in-school mediated communication campaign based on social marketing principles, in combination with a participatory, community-based media effort, on marijuana, alcohol and tobacco uptake among middle-school students. Eight media treatment and eight control communities throughout the US were randomly assigned to condition. Within both media treatment and media control communities, one school received a research-based prevention curriculum and one school did not, resulting in a crossed, split-plot design. Four waves of longitudinal data were collected over 2 years in each school and were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models to account for clustering effects. Youth in intervention communities (N = 4,216) showed fewer users at final post-test for marijuana [odds ratio (OR) = 0.50, P = 0.019], alcohol (OR = 0.40, P = 0.009) and cigarettes (OR = 0.49, P = 0.039), one-tailed. Growth trajectory results were significant for marijuana (P = 0.040), marginal for alcohol (P = 0.051) and non-significant for cigarettes (P = 0.114). Results suggest that an appropriately designed in-school and community-based media effort can reduce youth substance uptake. Effectiveness does not depend on the presence of an in-school prevention curriculum.

The variability of genetic and environmental estimates by agent and method is also examined. A total of 77 monozygotic and 72 dizygotic twin pairs and each twin's close friend were assessed. The informants included parents, teachers, and twins, and the methods involved questionnaire reports and coder ratings of videotaped dyadic interactions between each twin and their close friend. Twin intraclass correlations and univariate models attributed DPA and PROB to genetic, and shared and nonshared environmental effects. Parameter estimates differed by rater and method, however. Results accentuate the imperative to attend to method effects inherent in MTMM behavioral geneticresearch.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the influence of exposure to US-produced television programs and family rules prohibiting alcohol use on the development of normative beliefs, expectancies, and intentions to drink alcohol in the next 12 months among a group of Norwegian adolescents who reported that they had not previously consumed alcohol. Data were collected via a survey administered to 622 eighth and ninth graders enrolled at ten junior highs in southeastern Norway. To examine these relationships we tested the fit of a structural equation model which was based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1988). Data from the non-drinkers (n= 392, 63% of the respondents) were used. To control for the influence of peer drinking on behavioral intentions, our model was tested under two group conditions: (1) those subjects reporting that they have no friends who drink alcohol and (2) those subjects reporting that they have one or more friends who drink. The findings indicate that the influence of TV exposure was a significant predictor (directly) of normative beliefs, expectancies (indirectly) and intentions to drink (both directly and indirectly) only for those subjects who reported having no friends who drink. For the group with non-drinking friends, family rules constrain intentions only indirectly by influencing normative beliefs. For those with friends who drink, however, family rules have a direct (inverse) effect on intentions. It is concluded that exposure to US-produced television programs functions as a limited knowledge source only for those subjects who had little or no personal experience with alcohol while the presence of family rules have limited impact on behavioral intentions.

AB Conduct disorder (CD) symptoms and substance dependence commonly co-occur. Both phenotypes are highly heritable and a common genetic influence on the covariation has been suggested. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which genes and environment contribute to the covariance between CD and drug dependence using twins from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Sample and the Colorado Twin Registry. A total of 880 twin pairs (237 monozygotic [MZ] female, 195 MZ male, 116 dizygotic [DZ] female, 118 DZ male and 214 DZ opposite-sex) aged 13 to 18 (mean = 15.65) were included in the analysis. CD was assessed by lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) symptom count and a polysubstance dependence vulnerability index was developed from responses to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview--Substance Abuse Module. A bivariate Cholesky Decomposition model was used to partition the cause of variation and covariation of the two phenotypes. No sex-limitation was observed in our data, and male and female parameter estimates were constrained to be equal. Both CD symptoms and dependence vulnerability were significantly heritable, and genes, shared environment and nonshared environment all contributed to the covariation between them. Genes contributed 35% of the phenotypic covariance, shared environment contributed 46%, and nonshared environmental influences contributed the remaining 19% to the phenotypic covariance. Therefore, there appears to be pleiotropic genetic influence on CD symptoms and dependence vulnerability.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Type A-Type B multidimensional classification model has been useful for identifying a subgroup of alcohol dependent drinkers with more severe psychosocial problems and a poor prognosis. Evidence suggests its dimensions may be useful for identifying problem drinkers in the general population at risk for developing alcohol dependence. To date, the model has not yet been investigated for this purpose. The present study investigated the Type A/Type B distinction in a community sample of problem drinkers as well as its predictive validity among problem drinkers with no history of alcohol dependence.; METHOD: Households from a geographically delimited area in the United States were designated via random digit dialing and randomly designated members were screened for eligibility. A total of 876 participants met eligibility criteria and completed a structured interview (AUDADIS) on alcohol and other health related behaviors at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. A k-means cluster analysis was performed to identify subgroups of problem drinkers.; RESULTS: A two-cluster solution adequately fit the data and identified two main subgroups of problem drinkers consistent with a Type A-Type B distinction. The group differences held among those with and without a history of alcohol dependence and the subset of Type B drinkers with no history of alcohol dependence were approximately five times (beta = 1.56, p< or =0.01) more likely to have an initial onset of dependence than Type A drinkers at 1-year follow-up. In contrast, a DSM-IV alcohol abuse diagnosis at baseline did not predict 1-year onset of dependence.; CONCLUSIONS: The Type A-Type B model is useful for identifying untreated problem drinkers at risk for developing alcohol dependence. This model may facilitate the development of more targeted prevention efforts.

Based on a survey of 300 14 to 28-year-old dance partygoers recruited by outreaching social workers, the study provides data on risks in terms of the likelihood of drug abuse, coitus, unprotected coitus, fighting, and high-speed driving among the young people. Furthermore, it examines factors related to the dance party, together with a set of background factors on the partygoer's report of the chance of engaging in risky behavior as expected in the coming six months. Factors related to the dance party include the location (Hong Kong and Mainland China), fees, number of partners, dancers, police inspection, drug supply, drug sales, injuries, coitus, fighting, drug abuse, and environmental factors. The environmental factors are the availability of first aid, fire extinguishing, and drinking water facilities, light and audio effects, ventilation, drug circulation, underage admission, sex partners, fighting, and low-price beer. Implications of present findings for social policy and future research are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To test whether alcohol advertising expenditures and the degree of exposure to alcohol advertisements affect alcohol consumption by youth.; DESIGN: Longitudinal panel using telephone surveys.; SETTING: Households in 24 US media markets, April 1999 to February 2001.; PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 15 to 26 years were randomly sampled within households and households within media markets. Markets were systematically selected from the top 75 media markets, representing 79% of the US population. The baseline refusal rate was 24%. Sample sizes per wave were 1872, 1173, 787, and 588. Data on alcohol advertising expenditures on television, radio, billboards, and newspapers were collected.; MAIN EXPOSURES: Market alcohol advertising expenditures per capita and self-reported alcohol advertising exposure in the prior month.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the prior month.; RESULTS: Youth who saw more alcohol advertisements on average drank more (each additional advertisement seen increased the number of drinks consumed by 1% [event rate ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.02]). Youth in markets with greater alcohol advertising expenditures drank more (each additional dollar spent per capita raised the number of drinks consumed by 3% [event rate ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.05]). Examining only youth younger than the legal drinking age of 21 years, alcohol advertisement exposure and expenditures still related to drinking. Youth in markets with more alcohol advertisements showed increases in drinking levels into their late 20s, but drinking plateaued in the early 20s for youth in markets with fewer advertisements. Control variables included age, gender, ethnicity, high school or college enrollment, and alcohol sales.; CONCLUSION: Alcohol advertising contributes to increased drinking among youth.

AB Humans show large differences in the preferred timing of their sleep and activity. This so-called "chronotype" is largely regulated by the circadian clock. Both genetic variations in clock genes and environmental influences contribute to the distribution of chronotypes in a given population, ranging from extreme early types to extreme late types with the majority falling between these extremes. Social (e.g., school and work) schedules interfere considerably with individual sleep preferences in the majority of the population. Late chronotypes show the largest differences in sleep timing between work and free days leading to a considerable sleep debt on work days, for which they compensate on free days. The discrepancy between work and free days, between social and biological time, can be described as 'social jetlag.' Here, we explore how sleep quality and psychological wellbeing are associated with individual chronotype and/or social jetlag. A total of 501 volunteers filled out the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) as well as additional questionnaires on: (i) sleep quality (SF-A), (ii) current psychological wellbeing (Basler Befindlichkeitsbogen), (iii) retrospective psychological wellbeing over the past week (POMS), and (iv) consumption of stimulants (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol). Associations of chronotype, wellbeing, and stimulant consumption are strongest in teenagers and young adults up to age 25 yrs. The most striking correlation exists between chronotype and smoking, which is significantly higher in late chronotypes of all ages (except for those in retirement). We show these correlations are most probably a consequence of social jetlag, i.e., the discrepancies between social and biological timing rather than a simple association to different chronotypes. Our results strongly suggest that work (and school) schedules should be adapted to chronotype whenever possible.

This article provides an overview of the study design and baseline preliminary findings of our ongoing school-based intervention study.; DESIGN: Randomized intervention trial to test a school-based, environmental obesity prevention program in urban low socioeconomic status (SES) African-American adolescents. The intervention program was developed based on several behavioral theories and was guided by preliminary findings based on focus group discussion and baseline data.; SETTING: Four Chicago public schools in the US.; SUBJECTS: Over 450 5-7th graders and their families and schools were involved.; RESULTS: Our baseline data indicate a high prevalence of overweight (43% in boys and 41% in girls) and a number of problems in these children's physical activity and eating patterns. Only 26% reported spending > or = 20 min engaged in vigorous-moderate exercise in > or = 5 days over the past 7 days; 29% reported spending > or = 5 h each day watching TV, playing video games, or using computer. They also consumed too many fried foods and soft drinks. On average, 55% consumed fried foods > or = 2 times/day over the past 7 days; regarding soft drinks, 70% reported consuming > or = 2 times/day.; CONCLUSION: School-based obesity prevention programs are urgently needed in the target US urban, low SES, minority communities. These data can be used to inform intervention activities.

AB This article applies the concept of strategic ambiguity in examining viewer responses to brewer-sponsored "responsible drinking" television advertising campaigns. Strategically ambiguous messages are designed to engender diverse interpretations between varied audience segments, and these different selective perceptions should translate into relatively uniform positive corporate images. In this study, teenage and young adult respondents were shown a series of television spots from two leading alcohol companies. As predicted, there was a high degree of diversity in meanings of message content and campaign purpose derived by viewers, particularly among less sophisticated teenagers. Moreover, evaluative ratings of messages and sponsors were generally favorable and more uniform than interpretive responses. The research demonstrates how seemingly prohealth messages can serve to subtly advance both industry sales and public relations interests.

AB Recent health campaigns on college campuses have used a social norms approach, which suggests that one's perceptions of others' attitudes and behaviors are the key components in attitude and behavior change. However, the efficacy of social norms campaigns has been mixed. This study was conducted to assess the relationships among sociodemographics, normative perceptions, and individual attitudes on 3 health behaviors. Students at 2 universities (N = 393) completed questionnaires assessing how these variables related to their consumption of alcohol, tobacco use, and exercise behaviors. Regressions indicated that each of these variables was associated with behavior, but varied independent variables emerged as the salient predictors among behaviors. In several conditions the effect of normative perceptions on behaviors was not significant, a finding in direct opposition to social norms marketing. In all 3 behavioral conditions, the variable accounting for the greatest variance was whether or not the individual liked participating in that particular behavior. Thus, although some social norms marketing may be meeting with success, it may be the case that predicted attitudinal and behavioral changes will not be found when applied across diverse health topics.

AB Many colleges in the United States are employing social norms marketing campaigns with the goal of reducing college students' alcohol use by correcting misperceptions about their peers' alcohol use. Although the typical message used in these campaigns describes the quantity and frequency of alcohol use by the average student on campus, many students may find such a vague comparison to others to be socially irrelevant. This study compares the relative weight of perceptions about alcohol use by distant versus proximate peers in the prediction of college students' personal drinking behavior. The results of analyzing data collected from a sample of college students at a large public northeastern university (N=276) show that, as hypothesized, perceived alcohol use by proximate peers (best friends and friends) was a stronger predictor of students' personal alcohol use than perceived alcohol use by more distant peers (such as students in general), controlling for other strong predictors of alcohol use by college students (age, gender, race, off-campus residency, and sensation-seeking tendencies). The implications of these findings for the design of more effective social norms messages are discussed.

Those most likely to develop unhealthier attitudes drank more than those who developed healthier attitudes, consistent with psychological reactance to the messages. Therefore, the effects of social norms campaigns on those at greatest risk for primary and secondary alcohol effects due to their increased alcohol consumption could lead to increased risk for those participants, indicating that the widespread use of social norms campaigns needs to be scrutinized.

AB This paper highlights pathways for practice and policy to reduce alcohol abuse among adolescents aged 14-17 years. These pathways have been generated following a qualitative study in England that explored adolescents' motivations for binge drinking and the associated outcomes. There are three distinct pathways under consideration. Firstly, the research clearly evidences the close link between binge drinking and an array of risky outcomes, thus supporting policies that tackle generic risk taking (such as Youth Development Programmes). Secondly, given the widely reported positive motivations for binge drinking, adopting a harm-minimisation approach may be more appropriate than promoting abstinence. This harm-minimisation approach can build on strategies reported by adolescents (such as drinking in groups) and consider safer, more supervised venues for adolescent drinking. Thirdly, this study highlights key risk groups, which would arguably be in greater need of harm-minimisation strategies. These were adolescents who drank primarily for the 'buzz', and also those younger age groups (particularly 14 and 15-year-olds) whose drinking was mostly confined to unsupervised, often outdoor locations. This was in contrast to slightly older age groups who, although illegally, were often able to access licensed premises which exerted more control over their drinking. The paper closes by referencing some of the wider policy issues, which must be taken into consideration when attempting to change the culture of binge drinking in England. These include issues surrounding the advertising and marketing of alcohol, the provision of alcohol education in schools and the promotion of alternative, safer activities for adolescents.

AB Alcohol abuse among adolescents is a cause for concern. Around 1995 alcopops (sweetened alcoholic drinks) entered the scene and caused even more concern. Many fear that the sweet taste makes is easier to start drinking for those not yet used to drinking alcohol and the marketing appears aimed at adolescents. Because alcohol use has been linked to television viewing in general and music video viewing in particular this article examined whether a relationship existed between television and music video exposure and the consumption of alcopops. Data were collected with a questionnaire focused on television exposure and alcohol behavior. Respondents were a random sample of 2,546 first- and fourth year schoolchildren of Flanders, the Dutch speaking region of Belgium (60% of the Belgian population). Self reported general TV viewing, music video exposure and drinking of alcopops at home and/or while going out were measured. 68.4% of the respondents watched music videos at least several times a week. The odds of being an alcopop drinker at home increased by 196% for those, who watched music videos at least several times a week (OR = 1.961). For each additional hour of TV viewed per day, the respondents were 17% more likely to be drinkers of altopops at home (OR = 1.169). The odds of being an alcopop drinker, when going out increased by 239% for those who watched music videos at least several times a week (OR = 2.394). For each additional hour of TV viewed per day, the respondents were 19% more likely to be drinkers of alcopops when going out (OR = 1.186). These findings suggest that there is an association between music video exposure and use of alcopops not explained by overall exposure to television. This relationship merits further attention as it is a better predictor of alcopop use, than the control variables and overall TV viewing.

AB This study examines the relative contribution of exposure to entertainment and music magazines on binge drinking among a group of teenagers under the supervision of a juvenile court system in a medium-sized western United States community. Despite having a large proportion of adolescent readers, entertainment and music magazines typically include a substantial number of advertisements for alcoholic beverages in each issue. Data were collected via a self-report questionnaire administered to 342 juvenile offenders (ages 12-18 years). Three-quarters of our respondents reported they have used alcohol and about 37% indicated they were binge drinkers. As anticipated, binge drinkers were more frequent readers of entertainment and music magazines than non-binge drinkers. Binge drinkers also estimated that larger portions of their classmates used alcohol and would be more accepting of regular drinking than non-binge drinkers. Results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict whether our subjects typically consumed five or more drinks during a drinking episode indicated that perceived ease of access, age, gender, the number of best friends who drink, parental drinking (inversely), and entertainment and music magazine reading frequency were significant predictors of binge drinking. We conclude that the predictive influence entertainment and music magazine reading frequency may actually reflect a selectivity bias among a segment of the youth sub-culture already inclined toward alcohol use and abuse. We recommend that entertainment and music magazine reading should be considered only within the constellation of other risk factors when assessing risk for potential alcohol abuse.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the cumulative influence of adverse behavioural, social, and psychosocial circumstances from adolescence to young adulthood in explaining social differences in overweight and obesity at age 30 years and if explanations differ by gender.; DESIGN: A 14-year longitudinal study with 96.4% response rate.; SUBJECT: Data from 547 men and 497 women from a town in north Sweden who were baseline examined at age 16 years and prospectively followed up to age 30 years.; MEASUREMENTS: Overweight and obesity were ascertained at ages 16 and 30 years. Occupation and education were used to measure socioeconomic status. The explanatory measurements were: age at menarche, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, TV viewing, home and school environment, social support, social network, and work environment.; RESULTS: No gender or social difference in overweight was observed at age 16 years. At age 30 years, significantly more men than women (odds ratio (OR) = 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14-3.68) were overweight or obese. Educational level was associated with overweight at age 30 years, but not occupational class. Both men (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.10-2.19) and women (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.16-2.73) with low education (< or =11 years) were at risk of overweight. The factors that explained the educational gradient in overweight among men were low parental support in education during adolescence, and physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and nonparticipation in any association during young adulthood. The educational gradient in overweight in women was explained mostly by adolescence factors, which include early age at menarche, physical inactivity, parental divorce, not being popular in school, and low school control. Restricted financial resource during young adulthood was an additional explanatory factor for women. All these factors were significantly more common among men and women with low education than with high education.; CONCLUSION: Social inequities in overweight reflect the cumulative influence of multiple adverse circumstances experienced from adolescence to young adulthood. Underlying pathways to social inequity in overweight differ between men and women. Policy implications to reduce social inequity in overweight include reduction of social differences in health behaviours and social circumstances that take place at different life stages, particularly psychosocial circumstances during adolescence.

AB This article describes a new biomarker known as the Early Detection of Alcohol Consumption (EDAC) test, which has been steadily penetrating the U.S. market. The EDAC uses routine laboratory tests to make a prediction of heavy drinking in any given person. When tested in mainstream insurance populations, the EDAC has shown twice the specificity of the traditional liver enzyme tests and is significantly more sensitive than the CDT test, which is expected because the EDAC uses a combination of laboratory tests. Maximum diagnostic accuracy is achieved when the CDT test is used to confirm a positive EDAC test. Since brief interventions have proven successful, the early identification of alcohol problems becomes a vital role for physicians. Improved awareness of alcohol misuse can certainly be accomplished through an increased use of biomarkers, with and without concomitant self-report. The ultimate goal is to facilitate early intervention and the successful management of patients diagnosed with heavy drinking.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the impact of viewing depictions of alcohol in entertainment media on adolescent drinking behavior. Our aims were to assess drinking in a sample of popular contemporary movies and to examine the association of movie alcohol exposure with early-onset drinking in an adolescent sample.; METHOD: We conducted a school-based cross-sectional survey (N=4655) with longitudinal follow-up of never-drinkers (N=2406) involving adolescents ages 10-14 years and recruited from 15 New Hampshire and Vermont schools. Screen depictions of alcohol use were timed for each of 601 popular contemporary movies. Each adolescent was asked if he/she had seen a unique list of 50 movie titles, randomly selected from the larger pool. Movie alcohol use was summed for movies the adolescent had seen, adjusted to reflect exposure to the larger pool and modeled as a continuous variable.; RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of the movies in the sample depicted drinking; median screen time for movie alcohol use was 2.5 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.9-5.0 minutes). Median exposure to movie alcohol use from the 601 movies was 8.6 hours (IQR: 4.6-13.5 hours). Overall 23.1% of the cross-sectional sample had tried alcohol, and 14.8% of initial nondrinkers had tried alcohol at the follow-up assessment. We found statistical evidence to support a curvilinear association between higher exposure to movie alcohol use and increased risk of prevalent and incident alcohol use, with a statistically significant linear and quadratic effect, and suggesting a higher dose-effect relationship at lower movie alcohol exposure levels compared to higher levels. The linear and the quadratic associations remained strong and significant in cross-sectional and prospective models after controlling for sociodemographics (grade in school, school, gender, parent education), personality characteristics of the adolescent (sensation seeking, rebelliousness, self-esteem), school performance, parenting style, and smoking experimentation, suggesting that exposure to movie alcohol use is an independent risk factor for early-onset alcohol use.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence for an association between exposure to movie alcohol use and early-onset teen drinking. The association is moderate in effect size and independent of a number of potential confounders. Because exposure to movie alcohol use is common, it may have important population implications as a potentially modifiable risk factor.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although early use of alcohol is an immediate and long-term risk for young people, proven prevention strategies are limited. Mass media interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing use of other substances by adolescents. This study tested the impact of a 4-year media campaign designed to reduce alcohol use by early adolescents.; METHOD: Theory-based television and radio messages promoting avoidance of alcohol were developed and delivered to an audience of young people as they matured from Grades 4-5 to Grades 7-8. A set of eight school districts was identified as the Media Area; eight matching districts served as the Comparison Area. Independent Grade 7-8 surveys were conducted in all districts at baseline (N= 2897) and after the interventions (N=2419). Unanticipated community coalitions working to reduce youth substance use were introduced into 10 of these 16 communities during the same time period.; RESULTS: Exposure of the target audience to the media messages was lower than expected, and the unplanned community coalition interventions may have favored the Comparison Area. The main analyses indicated that the media interventions did not significantly affect alcohol use or its mediators. Supplementary analyses suggested a substantial impact of community coalitions on alcohol use and several key mediators.; CONCLUSIONS: The mass media interventions provided by this study had no effect on adolescent alcohol use or its psychosocial mediators. Factors external to the study reduced chances of detecting media effects. Further work is needed to develop and test mass media strategies for alcohol use prevention among early adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: Alcohol dependence confers risk for suicidal behavior. Some suicide attempts are precontemplated, whereas other attempts are impulsive. The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and correlates of impulsive and precontemplated suicide attempts.; METHOD: Data were derived from analysis of The Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), which is a six-site family pedigree study of individuals in treatment for alcoholism (probands), relatives of probands, and control families. Subjects in the analysis were age 18 years or older with a diagnosis of current alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third Edition, Revised. Individuals reporting a lifetime history of one or more suicide attempts were divided into two strata: suicide attempters with a history of suicidal ideation that persisted for a week or more, conceptualized as attempters showing precontemplation (n=330), and suicide attempters without a history of persistent ideation, conceptualized as impulsive attempters (n=343). These groups were compared with subjects with no history of attempts (nonattempters; n=3115).; RESULTS: Precontemplated acts were carried out with greater intent and were more likely to result in medical treatment. Dependence on illicit drugs and history of depression were more likely among attempters showing precontemplation. Impulsive attempts were more likely to be carried out by women and individuals with higher levels of alcohol-related aggression.; CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of precontemplated suicide attempts by individuals with alcohol dependence should include a focus on recognition and treatment of depressive syndromes. Alcohol-related aggression was elevated among impulsive suicide attempters. Prevention efforts may include interventions targeting aggression.

In this chapter, an alternative program strategy is posited-one that places diversity with respect to culture, class, and environment at the center of prevention efforts. Such an approach, the authors argue, is more effective not only in appealing to the sensibilities of urban youth but also in altering their behavior.

AB BACKGROUND: Early alcohol use is associated with abuse and dependence of licit and illicit substances later in life. The role of genetic and environmental factors in this association is not conclusive.; METHOD: In 1992, data on substance use, abuse/dependence and psychiatric disorders were collected from 8169 male twin members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. The interview obtained age of onset of regular drinking (one drink/month for 6 or more months). Regression analyses of twin pairs discordant for early alcohol use tested whether the association between early drinking (before age 17) and adult substance use and abuse/dependence remained after controlling for genetic factors, family environment and covariates. Twin models tested for common genetic and/or environmental influences on early drinking and adult alcohol dependence and ever use and abuse/dependence on marijuana and other drugs.; RESULTS: Co-twin analyses suggested the association between early regular alcohol use and adult alcohol dependence, marijuana and other drug use, and marijuana and other drug abuse/dependence could not be entirely explained by common genetic and shared family environmental factors. Genetic contributions to early regular drinking were significantly correlated with those on use of marijuana (rA=0.59), use of other drugs (rA=0.64), alcohol dependence (rA=0.54) and abuse/dependence of marijuana and other drugs (rA=0.63 and 0.66). Small but significant unique environmental correlations (rE range 0.11-0.22) indicated that familial factors could not entirely explain the association between early alcohol use and later substance use, abuse and dependence.; CONCLUSIONS: Early regular drinking is associated with later alcohol dependence and use, abuse/dependence on drugs. The association is not entirely explained by genetic or shared family environmental factors. This suggests unique environmental factors contribute to transitions from early regular alcohol drinking to use, abuse and dependence on alcohol and other substances.

AB Researchers and the lay public have long known of a link between alcohol and aggression. However, whether this link results from alcohol's pharmacological effects or is merely an artifact of the belief that alcohol has been consumed (i.e., placebo effect) has been debated. The current experiments examined the propensity for alcohol-related cues to elicit aggressive thoughts and hostile perceptions in the absence of alcohol or placebo consumption. In Experiment 1, participants made faster lexical decisions concerning aggression-related words following alcohol-related primes compared with neutral primes. In Experiment 2, participants who first were exposed to alcohol advertisements subsequently rated the behavior of a target person as more hostile than participants who initially viewed control advertisements. Furthermore, this effect was largest among participants who most strongly associated alcohol and aggression. Findings are discussed in terms of semantic network theory and links in memory between alcohol and its anticipated effects.

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine associations of television viewing with overall food consumption; METHODS: A computerised 24-hour dietary recall and a questionnaire were completed by 1031 adolescents (+/- 12-14 years of age).; RESULTS: Those who generally watched more television were more likely to consume frequently advertised items such as soft drinks and snacks. Not all frequently advertised food items (e.g. cereals) were associated with television viewing. An inverse association was found with fruit, water and milk. A negative association was found with brown bread; a positive association was found with white bread. The results indicate that high television viewing and a less nutrient dense food pattern are part of a lifestyle influenced by common underlying factors.; CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition interventions aimed at improving adolescents' food habits should target high television-viewers. Our findings underline the importance of tackling socio-demographic differences.

AB OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of the volume of alcohol consumption and drinking patterns on alcohol-related aggression and victimization, both at the individual and class levels.; METHODS: Representative sample drawn from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) of 6496 Swiss adolescents (13 to 16 years). Hierarchical multi-level models were used to simultaneously estimate individual and environmental influences. In addition to indicators of consumption of alcohol and other substances, age, sex, socioeconomic indicators and satisfaction with the relationship to parents were used as covariates.; RESULTS: After controlling for confounding, both volume of alcohol consumption and the frequency of binge drinking occasions were associated independently with alcohol-related problems (aggression/victimization) on the individual level. On the aggregate level, there was colinearity between volume of drinking and frequency of heavy drinking occasions. When entered in the same model, however, only the effect of volume effect stayed in the same direction.; CONCLUSIONS: Not only individual volume of drinking, but also the way alcohol is consumed influences individual problem levels. This includes individual patterns of drinking as well as environmental influences at school. These results open up important considerations for theory, research and prevention.

AB The increase in childhood obesity over the past several decades, together with the associated health problems and costs, is raising grave concern among health care professionals, policy experts, children's advocates, and parents. Patricia Anderson and Kristin Butcher document trends in children's obesity and examine the possible underlying causes of the obesity epidemic. They begin by reviewing research on energy intake, energy expenditure, and "energy balance," noting that children who eat more "empty calories" and expend fewer calories through physical activity are more likely to be obese than other children. Next they ask what has changed in children's environment over the past three decades to upset this energy balance equation. In particular, they examine changes in the food market, in the built environment, in schools and child care settings, and in the role of parents-paying attention to the timing of these changes. Among the changes that affect children's energy intake are the increasing availability of energy-dense, high-calorie foods and drinks through schools. Changes in the family, particularly an increase in dual-career or single-parent working families, may also have increased demand for food away from home or pre-prepared foods. A host of factors have also contributed to reductions in energy expenditure. In particular, children today seem less likely to walk to school and to be traveling more in cars than they were during the early 1970s, perhaps because of changes in the built environment. Finally, children spend more time viewing television and using computers. Anderson and Butcher find no one factor that has led to increases in children's obesity. Rather, many complementary changes have simultaneously increased children's energy intake and decreased their energy expenditure. The challenge in formulating policies to address children's obesity is to learn how best to change the environment that affects children's energy balance.

AB The authors examined the relationships among gender, alcohol consumption, and parental monitoring, including television monitoring. Student volunteers (N = 150; 90% Caucasian, 79% women) participated by reporting retrospective general parental monitoring, television monitoring, and recent drinking behaviors. On the basis of the retrospective reports by the participants, when they were growing up the men received less overall parental monitoring but not less television monitoring than the women. Women's drinking quantity was correlated with parental monitoring, whereas men's drinking frequency was associated with both parental monitoring and television monitoring. Interestingly, men's binge drinking frequency was correlated with television monitoring but not with overall parental monitoring, whereas women's binge drinking frequency was correlated with overall parental monitoring but not with television monitoring. Implications for preventing alcohol misuse and ideas for future research are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: In US colleges, alcohol and tobacco pose substantial health risks but little is known about their co-occurrence, limiting development and use of appropriately targeted prevention efforts.; METHODS: Data from the 2001 HSPH College Alcohol Study (student n = 10,924; college n = 120) were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Co-occurring smoking/drinking risks were examined in aggregate, by gender, and by age of onset of regular drinking and smoking across 10 measures of drinking style, three categories of transitional drinking behavior, and by treatment behavior.; RESULTS: Over 98% of current smokers drink; a fraction (<1%) of lifetime and 7% of past year alcohol abstainers smoke. Across drinking pattern measures, 44-59% of drinkers smoke. Co-occurrence risks are greatest among youth reporting high total alcohol consumption (adjusted OR 4.21, p < 0.0001), drinking problems (adjusted OR 3.31, p < 0.0001) or symptoms of diagnosable alcohol abuse (adjusted OR 3.02, p < 0.0001). Risks are sharply elevated among students who self-medicate for drinking problems and do not seek/receive help (adjusted OR 1.87, p < 0.0001), and those reporting symptoms of diagnosable alcohol abuse who may or may not seek/receive help (adjusted OR 2.67, p < 0.01 and 2.96, p < 0.01, respectively). Females and students reporting early adolescent onset of regular smoking are at greatest risk.; CONCLUSIONS: Virtually all college smokers drink, and smoking and drinking are powerfully interrelated across drinking measures. Efficiency argues for jointly targeting both behaviors and developing interventions tailored to the special vulnerabilities of young women, students experiencing difficulties adjusting to college, and students reporting early onset of regular smoking.

AB This paper provides some disturbing facts and figures about the amount of television being watched by children. In addition, it reports on the volume and type of television advertising aimed at young people, both in the United Kingdom and other developed countries. In view of recent public and professional concern as to the possible adverse effects of food advertising on children's health, this study set out to examine what proportion of television advertisements, directed at children, promoted products potentially harmful to dental health. Forty-one hours of children's television programming broadcast on ITV1, the main UK commercial channel, were recorded on to videotape for subsequent analysis. Almost 1,000 adverts were analysed; each was timed and broadly categorised as relating to a food/drink product or non food/drink product. Advertisements for food and drink were further subdivided according to their sugar and/or acid content. We found that, on average, 24 adverts were shown per broadcast hour, which accounted for 15.8% of the total schedule time. 34.8% of adverts related to food/drink products, and 95.3% of these promoted products that were deemed potentially cariogenic or erosive. The most frequently promoted food/drink products included breakfast cereals with added sugar (26.3%), confectionery (23.7%) and non-carbonated soft drinks (18.1%). It is very concerning that, despite recent specific codes of practice outlined by the Independent Television Commission for Children's Advertising, many food and drink products promoted during children's programming are potentially damaging to dental health.

The authors review the literature on past and current drug, alcohol, and tobacco use prevention media campaigns, examining the similarities across 25 health communication programs with the aim of viewing their applicability for the prevention of youth problem gambling. Critical features of effective campaigns are identified and assessed in terms of their applicability for youth problem gambling. Recommendations for the design, implementation, and evaluation of a youth gambling media campaign are discussed.

AB This study compared alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverage advertising to which adolescents are exposed. A census of beverage advertising (N = 757) in popular magazines and television during November 1999-April 2000 was analyzed. Most alcohol ads appeared in Sports Illustrated (110), Rolling Stone (98), and Playboy (75) and outnumbered nonalcoholic beverage advertising by 3 to 1. Alcohol was almost never associated with dining. Alcohol ads emphasized sexual and social stereotypes and lacked diversity. One of every 6 magazine alcohol ads, and 1 of every 14 video-based ads, appeared to target teenagers. Many similarities existed between alcohol and nonalcohol ads. We conclude that alcohol is advertised heavily to youth through placement and appeals. The fact that themes in alcohol ads frequently parallel those in nonalcoholic beverage ads may further increase youths' receptivity.

AB BACKGROUND: Empirical findings suggest that psychiatric illness is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to compare the strength of the association of lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and lifetime major depression on CVD among Northern Plains American Indians.; METHOD: A total of 1414 participants aged 18-57 years completed a structured interview that assessed psychiatric diagnoses, alcohol abuse/dependence, self-reported CVD, and traditional CVD risk factors including age, sex, education, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking. Logistic regression analyses compared the odds ratios of CVD in participants with and without diagnosed PTSD or major depression.; RESULTS: The rates of lifetime PTSD and major depression were 15% and 8% respectively. CVD was more commonly reported by participants with PTSD than by those without PTSD (12% v. 5%, p<or=0.01). Likewise, more participants with major depression reported CVD than did their non-depressed counterparts (14% v. 6%, p<or=0.05). PTSD was significantly associated with CVD even after controlling for traditional CVD risk factors and major depression (odds ratio 2.0, confidence interval 1.1-3.8). In contrast, the association of major depression with CVD was not significant after accounting for both traditional risk factors and PTSD.; CONCLUSIONS: Rates of PTSD are high in American Indian communities. Rising CVD rates in this population may be better understood if PTSD is considered along with other traditional risk factors. Future research should examine the association and mechanisms of PTSD and CVD prospectively. Such data could lead to more effective CVD prevention efforts for American Indians.

AB Suicide is second only to accidents as the most common cause of death for children and adolescents age 10 to 19 in Canada. All of the pediatric cases that were referred to the Hamilton Regional Forensic Pathology Unit from 1993 to 2002 were reviewed. For the purpose of this study, pediatric deaths were defined as deaths in the age group of 1 day up to and including 19 years of age. Specific criteria for suicide were applied to each case, independent of the manner of death issued by the coroner. The criteria were 3-fold. First, homicide had to be ruled out by the police investigation and autopsy findings. Second, the method had to be consistent with self-infliction. Finally, there had to be some evidence of suicidal intent. Questionable cases were discussed among the authors, and if reasonable intent could not be established, then the case was excluded. The autopsy and police reports were examined in detail regarding age, sex, location and method of suicide, presence of suicide notes, and any contributing psychologic factors or stressors. Of the 501 pediatric autopsies performed during the 10-year period, 31 (6%) met the criteria of suicide. The majority of cases (87%) were in older adolescents (age 15 to 19), and the male to female ratio was 2.4:1. Psychologic factors were identified in some of the cases, including depressed mood (77%), suicidal ideation (45%), previous suicide attempts (23%), and drug or alcohol problems (19%). Most of the suicides (61%) occurred in the victim's home, and 12 (39%) cases left a suicide note. In 9 cases (29%), alcohol or street drugs were detected postmortem, though in 8 cases toxicology was not performed. Hanging (48%) was the most common method of suicide, followed by firearms (13%), poisoning (10%), drowning (10%), and blunt force vehicular trauma (10%). Almost 60% of the male suicides were by hanging. No specific trend was identified in the 9 female suicides. These results were compared with similar studies within Canada and other countries. Overall, the method of suicide is dictated by what is convenient and readily available, though the acceptance of various suicide methods can change over time. Suicide prevention efforts should be tailored to address local trends.

AB AIMS: To describe the frequency of alcohol consumption and beverage preferences in eight countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).; DESIGN: Cross-sectional.; SETTING: Populations of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation and Ukraine.; PARTICIPANTS: Representative samples of the adult population of each country (overall sample size 18,428; response rates: 71-88%).; MEASUREMENTS: A standardised questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers to examine alcohol consumption frequency and usual intakes of beer, wine and strong spirits.; FINDINGS: Between 11 and 34% of males and 26-71% of females reported never drinking alcohol. Abstention was lowest in the Russian Federation and Belarus, two traditional spirits-drinking countries. It was particularly high in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, two countries with a relatively low frequency of alcohol consumption but large amounts consumed per occasion (particularly Georgia). On the contrary, Moldovan respondents drank frequently, but consumed smaller amounts per occasion. As expected, spirits were consumed in largest amounts in traditional spirits-drinking countries, as well as Armenia and wine in traditional wine-drinking countries. Beer consumption was relatively high in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (males), particularly in young respondents.; CONCLUSIONS: Although cross-country comparisons of alcohol intake should be interpreted cautiously, this study suggested that drinking patterns in the countries examined are not entirely typical of usual dry/wet drinking cultures, and confirms that the CIS is very diverse in terms of drinking patterns and beverage preferences. The study provides an important baseline for future comparisons as markets open to new products, as has been the case elsewhere in Europe.

AB The goal of the current study was to explore notions of masculinity and their linkages to HIV/AIDS among Owambo men and women in Namibia, where an estimated one-fifth of 15-49 year-olds have acquired HIV. Thirteen open-ended interviews and three focus groups were conducted with 50 male and female participants aged 19-50 in rural and urban Namibia. Qualitative analysis revealed six central themes: the evolving meanings of masculinity, power dynamics between men and women, women as active agents, the tension between formal and informal education and HIV transmission, alcohol and masculinity, and the blending of masculinity and explanations of HIV and AIDS. The findings suggest both direct and indirect linkages between notions of masculinity and AIDS, and highlight the need for prevention efforts that focus on providing alternative avenues for attaining culturally recognized markers of masculinity.

AB In the wake of welfare reform, thousands of low-income single mothers have transitioned into the labor market. In this article, the authors examine how the work conditions of mothers leaving welfare for employment are associated with the emotional well-being of 372 children ages 5 to 15 years. The authors examine the cumulative incidence, over a 5-year period, of maternal non-family-friendly work conditions, including long work hours, erratic work schedules, nonday shifts, and lengthy commute times, in association with children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and levels of positive behavior. The authors found that mothers' lengthy commute times are associated with higher levels of internalizing problem behaviors and lower levels of positive behaviors. ((c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved).

AB Parental divorce is associated with a number of emotional and behavioral problems in young-adult offspring, but theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that the relation may be partially or fully accounted for by passive gene-environment correlation or environmental selection characteristics. The current study used the Children of Twins Design to explore whether shared environmental or genetic factors confound the relationship between parental marital instability and measures of psychopathology. Comparisons of the offspring of adult twins in Australia on 3 factors of abnormal behavior, including drug and alcohol, behavioral, and internalizing problems, suggest that environmental influences associated with divorce account for the higher rates of psychopathology. The results are consistent with a causal connection between marital instability and psychopathology in young-adult offspring. Copyright (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved.

AB The authors examined genetic and environmental contributions to stability and change in heavy drinking from late adolescence to young adulthood in a sample of 1,152 twin pairs. In men, heavy drinking was similarly heritable at ages 17 (h2=.57) and 20 (h2=.39), and its stability owed primarily to common genetic factors. In women, heavy drinking was less heritable than in men at ages 17 (h2=.18) and 20 (h2=.30) and its stability was primarily due to enduring shared environmental influences. P3 amplitude, an event-related brain potential marker of alcoholism risk, was less predictive of heavy drinking in women than in men, providing further support for the proposition that biological factors have less impact on heavy drinking in young adult women than in young adult men.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors of beginning treatment with atomoxetine, a new attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drug, shortly after it was introduced into the marketplace compared with well-established stimulants for children in a managed care setting.; DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.; DATA SOURCE: Managed care claims database.; PATIENTS: A total of 45,144 patients aged 18 years or younger who filled a prescription for an ADHD-specific drug.; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For each patient, the most recent start of therapy between April 1 and December 31, 2003, was categorized by drug: atomoxetine; any stimulant; or short-, intermediate-, or long-acting stimulant. The categories were based on the first use of the drug without use of a drug in that same category in the previous 3 months. Logistic regression analysis of past-year administrative claims was applied to determine predictors of the start of specific pharmacotherapy. Patients with a claim of ADHD with hyperactivity were 1.50 times more likely to begin therapy with atomoxetine than with any stimulant (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-1.58). Patients with a history of tics (odds ratio [OR] 3.11, 95% CI 2.54-3.82), anxiety (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.24-1.48), pervasive developmental disorders (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.69-2.37), or frequent use of behavioral care services (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.48) were predisposed to starting treatment with atomoxetine relative to any stimulant, but patients with obesity were not (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.87). A short-acting stimulant was specifically preferred for patients with narcolepsy or hypersomnolence (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20-0.56). Alcohol dependence, but not drug dependence or drug abuse, was predictive of the selection of atomoxetine over a short-acting stimulant (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.25-7.09).; CONCLUSION: Atomoxetine therapy was systematically preferred for patients with psychiatric comorbidities, contraindications to stimulants, or relatively heavy use of behavioral health care.

AB Using a probability sample of 4,230 adolescents from grades 7-12, we used negative binomial regression to estimate the effects of peer and six family variables on the risk of adolescent drug use. Peer drug use had relatively strong effects of adolescent drug use. Parental drug attitudes, sibling drug use, and adult drug use had significant direct effects net of peer influences. In addition, they had significant indirect effects that were mediated by peer drug use. The influences of parental monitoring, attachment to mother, and attachment to father were statistically significant but relatively small. The findings applied to alcohol, binge drinking, cigarettes, marijuana, and other illicit drugs. Editors' Strategic Implications: The authors interpret their findings as being more consistent with social learning than social control theory. This research, although cross-sectional and limited to adolescents' self-reports, contributes to a growing literature on the direct and indirect influences of parents on their teens' substance use rates. It speaks to the need for school- and community-based prevention efforts to focus on families as well as peers.

AB AIMS: To investigate the genetic and environmental influences on tea consumption and their commonalities with coffee consumption; and to further examine the genetic and environmental aetiology of preference for tea/coffee.; DESIGN: A classical twin design was used in which the similarity of identical and non-identical twins is compared, enabling estimates of genetic, common environmental and unique environmental influence on the trait.; SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An Australian population-based sample of 1796 identical (i.e. monozygotic) and 2013 non-identical (i.e. dizygotic) twin pairs aged 16-87 years was studied, roughly three-fifths of whom were female. The sample represented approximately 70% of those approached for study participation.; MEASUREMENTS: As part of a Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire, respondents were asked how many cups of each tea and coffee they consumed per day. Additional measures of 'total tea and coffee consumption' and 'preference for coffee' were calculated.; FINDINGS: Age was positively associated with tea consumption but negatively associated with coffee preference; women consumed more beverages than men, but showed a lower preference for coffee. An inverse relation between tea and coffee consumption--larger in females (-0.41) than males (-0.34)--was supported. This association was mediated entirely by the unique environment in males, and by both the unique environment (68.3%) and genes (31.7%) in females. Tea and coffee drinking were shown to have similar heritabilities (0.46) in males, but tea consumption was influenced by common environmental factors whereas coffee consumption was not. Coffee preference was shown to be influenced by genes (0.42) and the unique environment (0.58).; CONCLUSIONS: As the patterns of genetic and environmental variation were shown to differ for tea and coffee consumption it may be more informative to retain them as separate measures of caffeine intake in future studies of stimulant use and taste perception.

AB Numerous studies on the mental health effects of terrorist attacks have been published, with some reporting increases in smoking and drug and alcohol use. None have reported on changes in sexual behavior. To investigate the impact of the September 11 attacks on sexual and drug- and alcohol-using behaviors of men who have sex with men (MSM), an anonymous Internet survey was conducted to obtain information retrospectively on behavior during three month periods before and after the attacks. A total of 2,915 MSM from all 50 U.S. states completed the survey. Men who were exposed to the attacks were not differentially targeted for the survey since the online banner ad used to recruit did not mention September 11. Exposure to the attacks varied: 11.4% lost a friend or relative; 5% witnessed the attacks in person; and nearly all saw the attacks on television within one hour of their occurrence. Nearly equal proportions of men reported increases and decreases in the number of sex partners following September 11. Small, statistically significant increases in unprotected anal intercourse and alcohol use, but not illicit drug use, were found when behavior after September 11 was compared to that before the attacks. Men who lost a friend or relative in the attacks were significantly more likely to report unprotected anal intercourse, an increased number of sex partners, and increased alcohol use after September 11 than those who did not. Counseling about substance abuse and risky sexual behavior should be incorporated into trauma-related programs for adolescents and adults.

AB A significant number of college women are at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) owing to binge drinking paired with using contraception ineffectively. This article describes a randomized controlled trial of a one-session motivational interviewing-based intervention to reduce AEP risk among college women and presents 1-month outcomes demonstrating the early impact of this intervention. There were 228 female students from a mid-Atlantic urban university enrolled in the trial. Eligibility criteria were being in the age range of 18-24 years and being at risk for AEP. Risk for AEP was defined as having sexual intercourse with a man in the past 90 days while using contraception ineffectively (no use, incorrect use of an effective method, or use of an ineffective method only); drinking at risky levels was defined as engaging in at least one binge in the past 90 days or consuming an average of eight standard drinks per week. One-month outcome data were available for 212 of the 228 enrolled women (a follow-up rate of 93%), with complete data available for 105 women assigned to the control condition and 94 assigned to the intervention condition. At 1-month follow-up, 15% of the control subjects and 25% of the intervention women reported no risk drinking, a significant difference favoring the intervention group. Significantly fewer control subjects (48%) used effective contraception at 1-month follow-up as compared with intervention women (64%), chi(2)(1) = 5.1, p < .03. Significantly more intervention women (74%) were no longer at risk for AEP at 1 month as compared with control subjects (54%), chi(2)(1) = 8.15, p < .005. Factors that were associated with continued AEP risk at 1-month follow-up were a higher number of standard drinks per day consumed in the month prior to baseline (odds ratio, 1.1) and assignment to the control condition (odds ratio, 2.9). The risks of unintended pregnancy and AEP among drinking women in college merit greater prevention efforts. The results of this study show the promise of one preventive intervention that warrants additional study.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study addressed the rate and predictors of substance abuse relapse among clients with severe mental illness who had attained full remission from substance abuse.; METHODS: In a ten-year prospective follow-up study of clients with co-occurring severe mental and substance use disorders, 169 clients who had attained full remission, defined according to DSM-III-R as at least six months without evidence of abuse or dependence, were identified. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was developed to show the pattern of relapse, and a discrete-time survival analysis was used to identify predictors of relapse.; RESULTS: Approximately one-third of clients who were in full remission relapsed in the first year, and two-thirds relapsed over the full follow-up period. Predictors of relapse included male sex, less than a high school education, living independently, and lack of continued substance abuse treatment.; CONCLUSIONS: After attaining full remission, clients with severe mental disorders continue to be at risk of substance abuse relapse for many years. Relapse prevention efforts should concentrate on helping clients to continue with substance abuse treatment as well as on developing housing programs that promote recovery.

AB This study re-evaluated the effectiveness of the anti-drink driving and anti-speeding enforcement and publicity campaigns implemented in the Australian State of Victoria which have thus far yielded mixed results in several evaluations. As opposed to previous evaluations, this study focused on the effects of these campaigns on young male drivers who formed the primary target and examined the combined effects of the campaigns on the total number of serious crashes. Our results showed that the anti-drink driving enforcement and publicity campaigns had a significant independent effect in reducing crashes but their interactive effect was anti-complementary. Conversely, the anti-speeding enforcement and publicity campaigns had no independent effect but their interactive effect was significant in reducing serious crashes involving young male drivers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To summarize the evidence for the following six strategies to prevent or treat overweight among children: promoting breastfeeding, promoting physical activity, reducing TV/video viewing, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, reducing sugar-sweetened drink consumption, and reducing portion sizes.; METHODS: Summarization of the relevant literature including review articles, relevant newly published work, the Institute of Medicine's Report on Preventing Childhood Obesity and the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity, 2001. This is not a comprehensive review.; RESULTS: Evidence for the association between each strategy and overweight varies. For breastfeeding, physical activity, and TV viewing, there are large review studies. Breastfed children may have a small reduction in risk for overweight. Participation in physical activity may reduce the risk of overweight among school-aged children and adolescents. For preschool- and school-aged children, reducing TV viewing time may reduce their risk of overweight, but most studies report small significant associations. Evidence for an association between each dietary factor and overweight is limited and inconclusive. The biggest gaps in evidence are for the effectiveness of interventions using these strategies. The reviewed interventions based on increasing physical activity (n=7) were effective. Two randomized trials suggest that reducing TV viewing reduces overweight. No intervention studies were found that examined the effectiveness of changing fruit and vegetable consumption, sugar-sweetened drink consumption, or portion sizes. Further clarification of the effect of breastfeeding on obesity is needed.; CONCLUSIONS: These six strategies are reasonable ways to attempt prevention or treatment of overweight in children. Strength of the evidence varies by strategy. The key finding is that more applied research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these and other strategies.

AB This paper investigates the affective responses of youth toward specific elements featured in television alcohol advertisements (i.e., people character, animal character, music, story, and humor). It also examines the associations between advertising likeability and its potential influence. Respondents were 253 children and adolescents in California (47% male; aged 10-17). Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires in group settings. Respondents were shown a stimulus tape containing television advertisements for beer and soft drinks. The tape was stopped at the end of each advertisement to allow respondents to answer questions about that advertisement before viewing the next. Perceived likeability of beer advertisements is a function of the positive affective responses evoked by the specific elements featured in the advertisements. Liking of specific elements featured in beer advertisements significantly contributed to the overall likeability of these advertisements and subsequently to advertising effectiveness indicated by purchase intent of product and brand promoted by these advertisements. Advertisements that focus primarily on product qualities or send a message of legal drinking age were rated less favorably and evoked less desire to purchase the product. Implications for countering the effects of alcohol advertising on young people are discussed.

AB This article will examine HIV/AIDS and substance abuse prevention for urban Native youth in Oakland, California. It will highlight the Native American Health Center's Youth Services programs. These programs incorporate solutions based on a traditional value system rooted in Native culture and consisting of youth empowerment, leadership training, prevention activities, traditional cultural activities and wellness and life skills education. They aim to reduce HIV/AIDS and substance abuse risk for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth through structured, community-based interventions. The Youth Services Program's events, such as the Seventh Native American Generation and the Gathering of Native Americans, offer effective and culturally relevant ways of teaching youth about American Indian/Alaska Native history, intergenerational trauma, and traditional Native culture. Satisfaction surveys gathered from these youth provide invaluable data on the positive effects of these prevention efforts. The need for culturally relevant and culturally appropriate HIV/AIDS and substance abuse prevention programs for urban AI/AN youth is apparent. These prevention efforts must be creatively integrated into the multidimensional and complex social structures of Native American youth.

AB The influence of alcohol advertising on young people continues to be the subject of much debate. This paper presents a review of the literature showing that, while many econometric studies suggest little effect, more focused consumer studies, especially recent ones with sophisticated designs, do show clear links between advertising and behaviour. Furthermore, these effects have to be viewed in combination with the possible impact of other marketing activities such as price promotions, distribution, point of sale activity and new product development. Here, the evidence base is less well developed, but there are indications of effects. It must be acknowledged that categorical statements of cause and effect are always difficult in the social sciences; marketing is a complex phenomenon involving the active participation of consumers as well as marketers and more research is needed on its cumulative impact. Nonetheless, the literature presents an increasingly compelling picture that alcohol marketing is having an effect on young people's drinking.

AB Where alcohol industry self-regulation is the primary protection against youth exposure to alcohol advertising, independent, systematic monitoring of youth exposure can promote public awareness of and greater accountability in the industry's practices. Using commercially available databases, the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth has combined occurrence and audience data to calculate youth (aged 12-20 years) and adult (above the United States legal drinking age of 21 years) exposure to alcohol advertising on television and radio, in magazines and on the Internet. This research in the United States shows that alcohol companies have placed significant amounts of advertising where youth are more likely per capita to be exposed to it than adults. Further analyses by the Center have demonstrated that much of this excess exposure of youth to alcohol advertising in the United States could be eliminated if alcohol companies would adopt a threshold of 15% (roughly the proportion of 12-20-years-old in the population 12 and above) as the maximum youth audience composition for their advertising. Although adoption of such a threshold would still leave much youth exposure to alcohol marketing in such "unmeasured" activities as sponsorships, on-premise promotions and campus marketing, it would assist alcohol companies in reaching their intended audiences more efficiently while reducing overall youth exposure to their advertising.

AB Flavored alcoholic beverages (FABs) were first introduced into the alcohol market in the early I980s in the form of wine coolers. FABs are sweet, relatively low alcohol content beverages that are designed for "entry-level" drinkers. The alcohol industry has introduced new products and production methods to expand the category's popularity. Research suggests that they are popular with underage drinkers, particularly teenage girls, and that the industry uses marketing practices that appear to target youth. FABs are now marketed globally, and their production and marketing vary by country based on national regulatory restraints. In the United States, industry representations that the products are malt beverages for regulatory purposes appears to violate many state laws because the alcohol in the FABs is derived from distilled spirits. Recommendations for regulatory reform, including new legal definitions of FABs, increased taxes, and restrictions on availability, are applicable at both national and state levels.

AB The marketing of alcohol produces a new challenge for policy development internationally, in part because of the increase in the use of new, unmeasured technologies. Many of these new developments are, as yet, relatively invisible in the policy arena. New approaches in branding, the utilization of marketing opportunities via branded events and new products provide additional complexity to attempts to monitor and to restrict the impact of marketing on young people and other vulnerable groups. Current attempts to restrict marketing globally, which rely primarily on voluntary codes and focus on traditional media, are inadequate to these challenges. A new statutory framework is required to enable the monitoring and control of the full marketing mix in ways which match the sophistication of the marketing efforts themselves.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examined how individual difference vulnerability factors affect college students' perceptions of beer commercial actors' age, attractiveness and drinking. We were also interested in whether viewers' exposure to a cautionary message would affect their perceptions of the actors' drinking behavior.; METHOD: Three groups of college students were exposed to the same set of two alcohol advertisements. After watching the ads, each group received a different cautionary message prior to answering questions about the ad's content: (1) a neutral message (viewed by 42% [n = 119] of the sample), (2) a U.S. federal warning (viewed by 31% [n = 89]) and (3) an industry message (viewed by 27% [n = 76]). We also examined three putative vulnerability factors: age (underage 21 or not), gender and family history of alcohol problems (yes or no) as well as the effects of quantity-frequency of alcohol consumption, episodic heavy drinking, severity of alcohol dependence, disinhibition sensation seeking and the eight factors of the Alcohol Expectancy Scale.; RESULTS: The cautionary messages had no effect on viewers' perceptions of characters' age, attractiveness and drinking behavior. Although neither of the commercials depicted the physical act of drinking, the student raters nevertheless perceived the characters to be heavy episodic drinkers. Those reporting more alcohol dependence symptoms perceived increased drinking for the male characters, as did females and viewers with expectancies for social and physical pleasure.; CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions of the drinking in beer commercials are based in part on the character depicted in the ad and in part on the demographic and personal vulnerability factors of the viewer.

AB Injection drug use is a growing problem on the US-Mexico border, where Tijuana is situated. We studied the context of injection drug use among injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana to help guide future research and interventions. Guided in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 male and 10 female current IDUs in Tijuana. Topics included types of drug used, injection settings, access to sterile needles, and environmental influences. Interviews were taped, transcribed verbatim, and translated. Content analysis was conducted to identify themes. Of the 20 IDUs, median age and age at first injection were 30 and 18. Most reported injecting at least daily: heroin ("carga", "chiva", "negra"), methamphetamine ("crico", "cri-cri"), or both drugs combined. In sharp contrast to Western US cities, almost all regularly attended shooting galleries ("yongos" or "picaderos") because of the difficulties obtaining syringes and police oppression. Almost all shared needles/paraphernalia ["cuete" (syringe), "cacharros" (cookers), cotton from sweaters/socks (filters)]. Some reported obtaining syringes from the United States. Key themes included (1) pharmacies refusing to sell or charging higher prices to IDUs, (2) ample availability of used/rented syringes from "picaderos" (e.g., charging approximately 5 pesos or "10 drops" of drug), and (3) poor HIV/AIDS knowledge, such as beliefs that exposing syringes to air "kills germs." This qualitative study suggests that IDUs in Tijuana are at high risk of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Interventions are urgently needed to expand access to sterile injection equipment and offset the potential for a widespread HIV epidemic.

In stratified and multivariable analyses maternal smoking throughout pregnancy and when the child was aged 14 were both associated with the child smoking: fully adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] comparing maternal smoking throughout pregnancy with never smoking was 1.40 [1.25, 1.65] and that comparing maternal smoking when the child was aged 14 with not smoking was 1.57 [1.19, 2.06]. The association of maternal smoking throughout pregnancy was specific for adolescent smoking and was not associated with alcohol consumption, TV viewing or self-report of poor school performance at age 14. Maternal and paternal educational attainment were also associated with smoking at age 14, with these associations attenuating towards the null with adjustment for childhood behavioural problems and cognitive function. There was no association of family income with smoking at age 14 once other explanatory variables were taken into account.

AB Self-affirming before reading about the link between alcohol and breast cancer promoted increased message acceptance among young women at higher risk. Differences were maintained on variables measured up to 1 month later. Relative to their nonaffirmed counterparts, higher risk, self-affirmed participants had higher ratings of risk, imagination, intention to reduce alcohol consumption, and negative affect, such as fear, while reading the leaflet. In contrast, there were no differences between the groups on measures of broader message acceptance (belief in the link, evidence strength). Thus, self-affirmation promoted acceptance of the personal relevance of the message, a critical step in the precaution adoption process. Overall, the findings support the view that self-affirmation in an unrelated domain can offset defensive processing of a threatening health message, promoting central route persuasion and producing consequential and durable increases in message acceptance.

AB The primary purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a brief, multi-health behavior intervention integrating physical activity and alcohol use prevention messages for high school-aged adolescents. A total of 604 participants, 335 9th and 269 11th grade students from a suburban high school in northeast Florida participated in this study. A randomized control trial was conducted with participants randomly assigned within grade levels to receive either a brief consultation and prescription with a mailed reinforcing follow-up flyer (Project SPORT) or a minimal intervention control consisting of a wellness brochure provided in school and a pamphlet about teen health and fitness mailed to the home. Differences between intervention groups were evaluated with a series of MANCOVA tests. Project SPORT participants demonstrated significant positive effects at 3-months postintervention for alcohol consumption, alcohol initiation behaviors, alcohol use risk and protective factors, drug use behaviors, and exercise habits, and at 12-months for alcohol use risk and protective factors, cigarette use, and cigarette initiation (p's < 0.05). A post hoc analysis examining interactions between past 30-day use of marijuana and/or cigarettes by treatment group indicates significant positive effects for drug using adolescents who received Project SPORT on alcohol consumption, drug use behaviors, and drug use initiation at 3-months, and for drug use behaviors and exercise habits at 12-months (p's < 0.05). A brief, 12-min one-on-one consultation integrating alcohol avoidance messages within those promoting fitness and other positive health behaviors holds promise for influencing adolescent alcohol and cigarette use and other health behaviors at posttreatment and 1 year later. Long-term sustained effects for cigarette and marijuana use, and both vigorous and moderate physical activity, were found among adolescents using marijuana and/or cigarettes prior to intervention.

AB This study examined demographic and psychosocial factors to determine the predictors of fighting attributed to alcohol use among adolescent drinkers. Analyses were based on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health which is a nationally representative sample of adolescents in Grades 7 through 11. The prospective analyses were restricted to those adolescent drinkers who participated in both data waves (n=6041) collected in 1995 and 1996. A logistic regression model was constructed using a backward elimination procedure to identify the significant predictors of initiating fighting attributed to alcohol use at Time 2 (1996). We found that frequent drinking, high-volume drinking, trouble in school, low college expectations and weekly involvement in sports were significant predictors of initiating fighting attributed to alcohol use. These findings suggest that prevention efforts targeting the reduction of frequent and heavy alcohol use may be particularly useful strategies for preventing fighting attributed to alcohol use.

AB OBJECTIVES: This exploratory study investigated the sources of four classes of abusable prescription medications (sleeping, sedative/anxiety, stimulant, and pain medications) that were used illicitly by undergraduate students in the past year. The relationship between these sources and other substance use was examined.; METHODS: In the spring of 2003, a random sample of 9,161 undergraduate students attending a large public Midwestern research university was selected to self-administer a Web-based survey.; RESULTS: The respondents identified 18 sources of prescription drugs that were classified into three broad categories: peer, family, and other sources. The majority of respondents who were illicit users obtained their prescription drugs from peer sources. Undergraduate students who obtained prescription medication from peer sources reported significantly higher rates of alcohol and other drug use than students who did not use prescription drugs illicitly or students who obtained prescription medication from family sources.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study offer strong evidence that undergraduate students obtain abusable prescription drugs from their peers. Greater prevention efforts are needed to reduce the illicit use and diversion of prescription medication.

AB This study examined changes in the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses at admission among children and adolescents treated for mental health problems in psychiatric inpatient settings between 1995 and 2000. Using a large, nationwide database (MarketScan) of private health insurance claims, our sample consisted of 5,346 children under the age of 18 who received psychiatric inpatient services, out of a total of 1,723,681 covered children. Odds ratios were used to measure changes in the prevalence of specific mental health disorders between 1995 and 2000. The study identified several significant changes, most notably, that the proportion of hospitalized children treated for bipolar or eating disorder doubled between 1995 and 2000. Significant decreases were observed for adjustment, anxiety, oppositional, and substance abuse disorders. This study lends support to recent concerns that the prevalence of bipolar disorder among the youth is increasing. Further research is needed to identify the underlying reasons for these observed changes.

AB We examined longitudinally collected behavioral reports by teachers on a unique twin sample at the ages of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 years. As twin and adoption studies implicate the role of genetic influence on behavioral problems found to be stable in epidemiological samples, the current study employs a developmental behavior genetic model to examine the extent to which genetic and environmental contributions to problem behaviors are stable and/or change during development. In this sample of 410 monozygotic (MZ) and 354 dizygotic (DZ) twins, MZ twins were rated as more similar than DZ twins on average. In general, boys were more frequently rated as displaying externalizing behaviors than were girls across each of the six observations, while girls' internalizing problems were found not to be significantly different from boys'. For both sexes, stability in externalizing problem behaviors was due to a single common genetic factor whose effects acted pleiotropically at each age in the presence of unique environmental influences that were transmitted from age-to-age. Change was largely due to uncorrelated age-specific non-shared environmental and additive genetic effects. Contributions to stability for internalizing problems were due to age-to-age transmission of earlier expressed genetic effects. Change for girls and boys internalizing problems were largely due to environmental experiences unique to siblings along with uncorrelated age-specific genetic effects. These results further inform the notion that individual environments are important factors in the etiology of problem behaviors, but suggest that heritable contributions to phenotypic stability are largely the same across middle childhood and early adolescence. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Despite their huge health toll, substance abuse disorders remain underappreciated and underfunded. Reasons include stigma, tolerance of personal choices, acceptance of youthful experimentation, pessimism about treatment efficacy, fragmented and weak leadership, powerful tobacco and alcohol industries, underinvestment in research, and difficult patients. Positive signs include declining prevalence rates, successful counter-marketing campaigns, changing public attitudes, new scientific discoveries that could yield new treatments, and effective new organizations. Further progress will require better treatment, more research, better education of health professionals, more nongovernmental support, and stronger leadership. Policy changes regarding each of the three substance groups are indicated, as are reforms in the criminal justice and educational systems.

AB To find out the prevalence of good knowledge, appropriate attitude and safe practice among printing workers exposed to organic solvents in Hong Kong, and to see if safe practice was influenced by the knowledge of and the attitude towards the harmful effects of organic solvents as well as other factors. The survey was conducted in a sample of 501 male printing workers from 28 factories in Hong Kong. The knowledge of and attitude towards the harmful effects of organic solvents, as well as the good practices adopted by the workers when handling solvents were explored using a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the major factors that influenced the knowledge, attitude and practice of workers. The prevalence of good knowledge, appropriate attitude and safe practice was low, being 20.4%, 38.4% and 22.0% respectively. Good knowledge was positively associated with awareness of the relevant legislation and past drinking behavior and negatively associated with current smoking. Appropriate attitude depended on having good knowledge and younger age. Safe practice did not depend on knowledge and attitude, but was positively associated with being informed of safety precautions and being supplied with chemical information by supervisors. The majority of workers believed that their employers, the Government and other statutory bodies should be responsible for providing information on chemicals, but very few of them actually obtained information from these sources. More workers preferred publications and talks rather than television as the means of obtaining further knowledge on chemicals. Front line supervisors have a pivotal role to play in improving safe practices of workers by informing them of the necessary precautions and supplying the relevant chemical information.

AB OBJECTIVE: Both genetic and common environmental influences contribute to twin associations for substance use; however, twin concordance rates may vary by environmental setting, indicating the presence of genetic-environmental interactions. The present study examined whether measures of family adaptability and cohesion may moderate the genetic influence on risk for alcohol use among female adolescents.; METHOD: We examined such interactions through the application of log-linear models using data from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development, a longitudinal study with extensive home interviews of adolescent (8-17 year old) female twins (386 monozygotic [MZ] pairs, 185 dizygotic [DZ] pairs) and their parents.; RESULTS: Twin concordance for alcohol use varied by average twin/parent reports of parental closeness. Differences between MZ-DZ correlations for alcohol use in families with low parental closeness, for example, were 0.97 and 0.67 (p < .001), respectively, compared with 0.79 and 0.73 (p = .24) for high parental closeness families. In addition, differences in twin concordance regardless of zygosity were found with greater twin similarities for alcohol use in strict families compared with leniently disciplined families, suggesting that the twin association interacts with common environmental influences on alcohol use.; CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the genetic effects on adolescent alcohol use interact with the measured family environment and that the heritability of alcohol use may vary according to quality of the parental relationship. If confirmed, prevention programs may benefit from this knowledge, tailoring their intervention to quality of parental relationship.

AB BACKGROUND: Adolescents in the United States are engaging in sexual activity at early ages and with multiple partners. The mass media have been shown to affect a broad range of adolescent health-related attitudes and behaviors including violence, eating disorders, and tobacco and alcohol use. One largely unexplored factor that may contribute to adolescents' sexual activity is their exposure to mass media.; OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine of what is and is not known on a scientific basis of the effects of mass media on adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors. Method. We performed an extensive, systematic review of the relevant biomedical and social science literature and other sources on the sexual content of various mass media, the exposure of adolescents to that media, the effects of that exposure on the adolescents' sexual attitudes and behaviors, and ways to mitigate those effects. Inclusion criteria were: published in 1983-2004, inclusive; published in English; peer-reviewed (for effects) or otherwise authoritative (for content and exposure); and a study population of American adolescents 11 to 19 years old or comparable groups in other postindustrial English-speaking countries. Excluded from the study were populations drawn from college students.; RESULTS: Although television is subject to ongoing tracking of its sexual content, other media are terra incognita. Data regarding adolescent exposure to various media are, for the most part, severely dated. Few studies have examined the effects of mass media on adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors: only 12 of 2522 research-related documents (<1%) involving media and youth addressed effects, 10 of which were peer reviewed. None can serve as the grounding for evidence-based public policy. These studies are limited in their generalizability by their cross-sectional study designs, limited sampling designs, and small sample sizes. In addition, we do not know the long-term effectiveness of various social-cultural, technologic, and media approaches to minimizing that exposure (eg, V-Chips on television, Internet-filtering-software, parental supervision, rating systems) or minimizing the effects of that exposure (eg, media-literacy programs).; CONCLUSIONS: Research needs to include development of well-specified and robust research measures and methodologies; ongoing national surveillance of the sexual content of media and the exposure of various demographic subgroups of adolescents to that content; and longitudinal studies of the effects of that exposure on the sexual decision-making, attitudes, and behaviors of those subgroups. Additional specific research foci involve the success of various types of controls in limiting exposure and the mitigative effects of, for example, parental influence and best-practice media-literacy programs.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine exposure, response to, and awareness of beer advertising in 2 age groups, including awareness of a Budweiser advertisement (ad) that portrayed lizards and an animated ferret.; METHODS: In the spring of 2000, 1,996 fourth graders and 1,525 ninth graders attending 1 of 60 South Dakota schools participated in an in-school survey. Several indicators of advertising awareness, exposure, and response were assessed: recognition, product naming, brand naming, and liking in response to stills drawn from 4 masked television beer ads, listing of beer brands, exposure, attention to, and skepticism toward television beer ads.; RESULTS: Fourteen percent of 4th graders and 20% of 9th graders recognized at least 3 of 4 sample beer ads. Seventy-five percent of 4th graders and 87% of 9th graders recognized the Budweiser ferret ad; about one in three 4th graders could name the brand it advertised, whereas more than three in four 9th graders could do so. When asked to list as many beer brands as they could, almost 29% of 4th graders listed 3 or more beer brands and 82% of 9th graders did so. Ninth graders liked beer advertisements more and paid greater attention to them, but 4th graders were exposed to them more often.; CONCLUSION: Television beer ads result in high levels of beer advertising awareness in children as young as age 9, and even higher awareness among 14-year-olds. Practices that expose or appeal to youth, including use of animated characters, should be avoided by beer advertisers.

AB UNLABELLED: There has been a remarkable increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity in most countries in recent years, which indicates that modern lifestyle is the triggering factor for genetic susceptibility. This report focuses on the two main environmental factors, nutrition and physical activity, that could influence paediatric obesity development, and how health professionals can address these aspects in the management of childhood obesity in a multidisciplinary treatment team. First, the role of a nutrition expert in the multidisciplinary obesity team is discussed and then the importance of physical activity in the treatment of paediatric obesity. The part on nutrition highlights some interesting areas in this field, namely glycaemic index, high-protein diet, fast foods, portion sizes and soft-drink consumption. Dietary treatment in childhood obesity should be combined with changes in physical activity to promote long-term weight loss. Research on the physical activity of children and adolescents indicates some significant changes over the last decades, which are also reviewed. Factors such as sports club participation and television viewing are discussed. The appropriate physical activity level and effective physical activity programmes are also presented. Physical activity can be promoted in childhood obesity treatment in many ways. Practical advice regarding physical activity programme and the role of exercise professionals in childhood obesity treatment team is given.; CONCLUSION: For successful obesity management, the child should be assessed and treated by a multidisciplinary team, including a physician, dietitian, exercise expert, nurse and behavioural therapist.

AB Drinking portrayals and alcohol advertising are common in popular media and young people are highly exposed to them. Although some studies found that exposure to drinking portrayals is related to increases in drinking among youth, other studies produced mixed and inconclusive findings. Similarly, research on the effects of alcohol advertising presents mixed findings. Recent longitudinal research and studies that used modeling techniques that controlled for reciprocal effects suggests that exposure to, attention to, and liking of alcohol advertising may influence children and adolescents' drinking beliefs and behaviors. Further research, and particularly longitudinal studies that address at-risk populations, such as children and minorities, is necessary before firm conclusions about the effects of media portrayals and alcohol advertising can be reached.

AB BACKGROUND: As adolescent tobacco use has been found to be a major predictor of future use, preventive efforts need to be focused on this section of population.; OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of knowledge regarding tobacco, risk-taking attitude, peers, and other influencers on tobacco and areca nut use, amongst adolescents.; SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A school-based cross-sectional study covering two schools. Students of classes IX and XI, of selected schools, participated in the study (n = 596).; METHODS: A pretested and validated, close ended, self-administered questionnaire was used. Sociodemographic factors, awareness regarding tobacco, risk-taking attitudes, role of peers and other influencers, and tobacco, areca nut and alcohol use, were studied.; STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Point estimates, 98% Confidence Intervals, tests of significance, bivariate and multivariate analysis (multiple logistic regression).; RESULTS: Almost 42% of tobacco users started before the age of 12 years. Peer pressure, general stress, and media were important influencers. Logistic regression analysis showed that students in public school were using more tobacco [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.85, P = 0.174] and tobacco/areca nut (OR = 1.14, P = 0.02). The difference in use between the genders and class in which studying was statistically not significant. Lesser proportion of those possessing adequate knowledge regarding tobacco used it as compared to those without adequate knowledge (OR = 0.13, P < 0.001) however, possession of adequate knowledge was not a good predictor of areca nut consumption (OR = 0.86, P = 0.585). The most important correlate for tobacco use (OR = 6.41, P < 0.001) and areca nut use (OR = 11.17, P < 0.001) was risk-taking attitude.; CONCLUSION: Multi-pronged and concerted efforts targeting children at an early age are required to prevent tobacco and areca nut use among adolescents.

AB Smoking, drinking, and drug use endure as popular yet dangerous behaviors among American teenagers. Films have been cited as potential influences on teens' attitudes toward and initiation of substance use. Social cognitive theory suggests that teen viewers may be especially likely to learn from teen models who they perceive as similar, desirable, and attractive. Yet, to date, no studies systematically have analyzed teen characters in films to assess the frequency, nature, and experienced consequences of substance use depictions. Assessments of content are necessary precursors to effects studies because they can identify patterns of representations that warrant further examination. Accordingly, a content analysis of top grossing films from 1999, 2000, and 2001 was conducted. Overall, two-fifths of teen characters drank alcohol, one-sixth smoked cigarettes, and one-seventh used illicit drugs (N=146). Almost no differences existed between substance users and nonusers with regard to physical attractiveness, socioeconomic status (SES), virtuosity, or gender. Drinkers and drug users were unlikely to suffer any consequences--let alone negative consequences--in either the short or long term. Characters rarely were shown refusing offers to drink or do drugs, or regretting their substance usage. Girls were more likely than boys to be shown engaging in multiple substance use activities (e.g., smoking and drinking). Overall, recent teen-centered films may teach teen viewers that substance use is relatively common, mostly risk-free, and appropriate for anyone.

AB BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet light exposure has a pathogenic effect on the development of skin cancer, whose prevalence increases worldwide. In Chile and the rest of the world, preventive educational campaigns are carried out to change high risk sun exposure behaviors.; AIM: To study the behavior of the Chilean population towards skin cancer prevention and to identify erroneous preventive practices and concepts.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey containing 17 questions about sun exposure behaviors, photoprotective measures and knowledge about ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer was used. It was applied during January and February 2004, to 1,143 subjects (mean age 30 years, 409 males), taking vacations in beach resorts in Chile.; RESULTS: The hours of higher sun exposure ranged from 12 AM to 4 PM. Thirty seven percent of subjects were exposed more than 2 hours during this high risk lapse. Women and subjects aged less than 25 years were those with the riskiest behaviors. Fifty four percent used some type of photoprotection and 50% used ocular protection. Seventy percent used creams with sun screen and 74% used a sun protection factor higher than 15. Seventy percent applied the sun screen as recommended. Thirty eight percent had at least one sun burn in the last two years. More than 90% of subjects were aware of the relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer but 60% did not know the hours of higher ultraviolet radiation. The information about sun exposure was obtained from television in 57% of surveyed individuals.; CONCLUSIONS: More educational campaigns about the risk of sun exposure are needed to reduce risky behaviors in the Chilean population.

AB Substance-using friends expose adolescents to models of, and opportunities for, substance use that may lead to its initiation or reinforce existing use. Using genetically informative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (P. S. Bearman, J. Jones, & J. R. Udry, 1998), the authors examined whether adolescents' exposure to friends' tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking was better explained by family-social or genetic influences. To conduct analyses, the authors constructed substance use exposure scores for adolescent siblings from the responses of siblings' nominated friends to self-reported smoking and drinking items. Using behavioral-genetic analyses of these substance use exposure scores, the authors estimated that 64% of the variance in adolescents' exposure to friends who smoke and drink could be explained by genetic influences, whereas shared environmental influences were zero. These results provide evidence of active, evocative, or both types of gene-environment correlations. Genetic factors can influence the formation of friendships with substance-using peers, thereby contributing to adolescents' exposure to substance use behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recently, the tobacco industry has focused marketing efforts on young adults through bar and club promotions, such as advertising and distribution of free cigarettes in these settings. This study estimates the fraction of the California young adult population that might be exposed and potentially influenced by these efforts.; DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were from 9364 young adult (18-29 years) respondents to the cross sectional population based 2002 California Tobacco Survey. As background, we analysed social smoking (only smoke with other smokers), and enjoyment of smoking while drinking. Our main focus was on bar and club attendance, what was observed in bars and clubs, and how this might differ according to respondents' risk for future smoking.; RESULTS: Social smokers comprised 30.0 (2.2)% of all current smokers, including experimenters. Nearly three quarters (74.5 (2.3)%) of current smokers/experimenters said they enjoyed smoking while drinking. About one third (33.8 (1.2)%) of all young adults said they attended bars and clubs at least sometimes; attendance was significantly higher among smokers and those at risk for future smoking. Close to 60% (57.9 (2.2)%) of bar and club attenders reported seeing cigarette advertising and promotions in these settings. Again, smokers and those at risk were more likely to report seeing such advertising and promotions in these settings.; CONCLUSIONS: About 20% of all young adults and about 30% of those at risk for future smoking (including current smokers) were exposed to tobacco advertising and promotions in bars and clubs. These California results may be conservative, but nonetheless indicate that the group potentially influenced is sizable.

AB The role of co-twin dependence (twins' closeness or reliance on the co-twin) was examined as a moderator of genetic and environmental influences on alcohol use in adolescence and early adulthood in a large longitudinal population-based study of Finnish twins (FinnTwin16). The associations between co-twin dependence and alcohol use were studied first at an individual level in adolescence (n = 3362) and early adulthood (n = 2912). Then, maximum likelihood models were fit to the two waves of data from same-sex twin pairs to assess the differences and changes in genetic and environmental influences on alcohol use (abstinence, drinking frequency, intoxication frequency); N = 1342 pairs in adolescence, and N = 1078 pairs in early adulthood. Overall, no significant associations were found between co-twin dependence and individual alcohol use. However, co-twin dependence importantly modulated genetic effects on drinking habits, especially in adolescence, but also in early adulthood. Co-twin-dependent twins reported greater similarity in their alcohol-related behavior across all alcohol-use measures at both time points, and the role of genes and environments varied according to co-twin dependence. Shared environmental factors explained most of the variation in drinking among co-twin-dependent twins in adolescence and contributed to drinking to intoxication during early adulthood. In contrast, among co-twin-independent twin pairs, genetic variance contributed significantly to all alcohol-use measures at both time-points. An interdependent sibling relationship is an important modifier of drinking habits, and it appears to reduce the impact of inherited liabilities on alcohol-related behavior especially in adolescence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine genetic and environmental influences on drinking in a nationally representative study of genetically informative adolescents followed into young adulthood.; METHOD: The average quantity of alcohol used per drinking episode during the past year was analyzed in 4432 youth assessed during adolescence (mean age of 16) and then 1 and 6 years later. The variance of quantity of alcohol consumed was decomposed into three components: additive genetic (a2), shared environmental (c2), non-shared environmental (e2). Four candidate genes were tested for association.; RESULTS: Wave 1 a2-0.52e2-0.48, Wave 2 a2-0.28e2-0.72, Wave 3 a2-0.30e2-0.70. Genetic correlations between Waves 1 and 2 were 0.85, Waves 1 and 3 were 0.34. The DAT1 440 allele was associated at Wave 1 (p=0.007). DRD2 TaqI A1/A2 was associated at Wave 3 (p=0.007). DRD4 and 5HTT were not associated. The DAT1 and DRD2 polymorphisms accounted for 3.1% and 2.0% of the variation, respectively.; CONCLUSION: Genetic influence on drinking behavior was common in adolescents longitudinally assessed 1 year apart, but was less correlated between these adolescents and their assessment as young adults at a subsequent time point. Polymorphisms in genes of the dopaminergic system appear to influence variation in drinking behavior.

AB AIM: To investigate longitudinally for both genders the relation between the age of onset of drinking and several indicators of alcohol use.; DESIGN AND SETTING: In the Finnish Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development, data have been collected by interviews, inventories, and questionnaires. Data on alcohol consumption was gathered at ages 14, 20, 27, 36 and 42 years; behavioural data at age 8.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 155 women and 176 men; 90.4% of the original sample consisting of 12 complete school classes in 1968.; MEASUREMENTS: The age of onset of drinking was determined based on participants' responses that were closest to the actual age of onset of drinking. Four indicators of the adult use of alcohol were used: frequency of drinking, binge drinking, Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-opener (CAGE) and Malmo modified Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (Mm-MAST). Socio-emotional behaviour at age 8 was assessed using teacher ratings and peer nominations.; FINDINGS: Early onset of drinking was related to the four indicators of the use of alcohol in adulthood both in men and women. The level of adult alcohol use and alcohol problems was significantly higher in men. The risk for heavy drinking was highest in men and women if drinking was started at less than age 16 years. Socio-emotional behaviour and school success at age 8 did not predict the age of onset of drinking.; CONCLUSIONS: Delaying the initiation of drinking from early adolescence to late adolescence is an important goal for prevention efforts. No clear risk group for early initiators of drinking could be identified on the basis of preceding behaviour among 8-year-olds.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study examined the prevalence rates and correlates of nonmedical use of prescription opioid analgesics among U.S. college students in terms of student and college characteristics.; METHODS: This study analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 10,904 randomly selected students attending 119 four-year colleges in 2001.; RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of nonmedical prescription opioid use was 12% and the past year prevalence was 7%. Approximately one in every four colleges had a prevalence of 10% or higher for past year nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Multivariate regression analyses indicated nonmedical use was more likely to occur among college students who were white, residents of fraternity and sorority houses, attended more competitive colleges, earned lower grade point averages, and reported higher rates of substance use and other risky behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the nonmedical use of prescription opioids represents a problem on college campuses. These findings have important implications for developing prevention efforts and therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the nonmedical use of prescription opioid analgesics among college students while not hindering necessary medication management for pain.

AB AIMS: To examine whether television viewing and music video exposure predict alcohol consumption while going out.; METHODS: Data were collected in two waves (February 2003 and February 2004). Respondents were a random sample of 1648 first and fourth year secondary school children of Flanders, Belgium. Self-reported general TV viewing and music video exposure at time 1 and the quantity of alcohol consumed while going out at time 2 were measured. Controls were gender, age group, smoking behaviour, and alcohol use (at time 1) and pubertal status (at time 2).; RESULTS: Overall television viewing per day and music television viewing at time 1 significantly predicted the amount of alcoholic beverages adolescents consumed while going out at time 2. These results remained significant after controlling for alcohol use at time 1, gender, smoking, and pubertal status.; CONCLUSIONS: TV viewing habits are a significant predictor of alcohol consumption while going out. TV viewing might cause an increase in alcohol consumption or might be an early symptom of developing alcohol habits.

AB Until recently, diabetes in children was virtually synonymous with type 1 diabetes mellitus, whereas type 2 diabetes was a disease of middle age and the elderly. Over the past 10-20 years, an alarming increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been reported from pediatric diabetes centers in North America and elsewhere in the world. Lifestyle factors responsible for the worldwide epidemic of overweight and obesity are responsible for the increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adults and children. This article briefly discusses the diagnosis and major types of diabetes in children but focuses on aspects of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, including demographics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, screening, prevention and treatment. The identification of children at risk for type 2 diabetes and the implementation of community-wide preventive programs will be essential to reverse the tide. The availability of calorie dense "fast foods," candy, and sugared soft drinks must be restricted in schools and other venues frequented by children. Parents must limit the amount of time their children spend watching television and playing computer games. After-school programs that promote physical activity should be a priority of local and central governmental agencies. Prevention will only succeed if governments and local communities recognize that childhood obesity is an important public health problem and provide an environment that promotes changes in lifestyle that prevent and reverse obesity.

AB BACKGROUND: Binge drinking, commonly defined as having more than five drinks on a single occasion, is a public health issue affecting two thirds of Canadian young adults between the ages of 19-24 years. To educate young adults about alcohol poisoning, a network of 16 Ontario Health Units developed and implemented a mass-media campaign. The focus of this article is to report on post-secondary students' perceptions about key media campaign strategies, elements and messages for future campaigns designed to increase awareness about the risks of binge drinking.; METHODS: As part of a multi-method process evaluation, nine focus groups were facilitated to explore the young adults' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about binge drinking and the campaign messages. Participants were also asked to identify specific marketing messages and techniques that would increase their level of awareness about the risks of binge drinking.; RESULTS: Participants recommended that campaigns be targeted towards parents and high school and post-secondary school students. Participants provided recommendations for the types of messages, images, and language they perceived would capture the attention of young adults. Television, posters and the internet were identified as key media channels for disseminating health information about the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption.; CONCLUSION: The problem of binge drinking is pervasive across Canadian campuses and students are largely unaware of the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption. To reach this target population, it is important for future media campaign developers to utilize language, definitions, graphics and channels of communication to which this group relates.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of awareness about five common diseases, namely: Tuberculosis (TB), Typhoid, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS among college female students of Karachi.; METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of female students aged 16-21 years from three colleges selected by convenient sampling method was conducted from January to May 2004. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire.; RESULTS: A large number of students (71%) knew that typhoid spreads by eating contaminated food and drinking infected water. Majority (84%) knew about cough as a mode of spread for TB whereas 69% thought that TB could spread through sneeze of a TB patient. Regarding AIDS, 90% knew that it is sexually transmitted. Majority (87%) knew about the association of hepatitis B and contaminated needles; 64% were aware of hepatitis C and abuse of contaminated needles; 88% knew about the spread of HIV by the use of contaminated needles. A large number (92%) mentioned television as their main source of information.; CONCLUSION: The general level of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS transmission was satisfactory among college girls in this study. The level of awareness of the young educated females about the modes of spread of typhoid, TB, hepatitis B and C is low. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of health education campaign regarding common infectious diseases, especially in young girls.

AB The purposes of this systematic review were to present and compare recent estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in school-aged youth from 34 countries and to examine associations between overweight and selected dietary and physical activity patterns. Data consisted of a cross-sectional survey of 137 593 youth (10-16 years) from the 34 (primarily European) participating countries of the 2001-2002 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Study. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was determined based on self-reported height and weight and the international child body mass index standards. Logistic regression was employed to examine associations between overweight status with selected dietary and physical activity patterns. The two countries with the highest prevalence of overweight (pre-obese + obese) and obese youth were Malta (25.4% and 7.9%) and the United States (25.1% and 6.8%) while the two countries with the lowest prevalence were Lithuania (5.1% and 0.4%) and Latvia (5.9% and 0.5%). Overweight and obesity prevalence was particularly high in countries located in North America, Great Britain, and south-western Europe. Within most countries physical activity levels were lower and television viewing times were higher in overweight compared to normal weight youth. In 91% of the countries examined, the frequency of sweets intake was lower in overweight than normal weight youth. Overweight status was not associated with the intake of fruits, vegetables, and soft drinks or time spent on the computer. In conclusion, the adolescent obesity epidemic is a global issue. Increasing physical activity participation and decreasing television viewing should be the focus of strategies aimed at preventing and treating overweight and obesity in youth.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic influences have been shown to play a major role in determining the risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, prenatal exposure to nicotine and/or alcohol has also been suggested to increase risk of the disorder. Little attention, however, has been directed to investigating the roles of genetic transmission and prenatal exposure simultaneously.; METHOD: Diagnostic telephone interview data from parents of Missouri adolescent female twin pairs born during 1975-1985 were analyzed. Logistic regression models were fitted to interview data from a total of 1936 twin pairs (1091 MZ and 845 DZ pairs) to determine the relative contributions of parental smoking and drinking behavior (both during and outside of pregnancy) as risk factors for DSM-IV ADHD. Structural equation models were fitted to determine the extent of residual genetic and environmental influences on ADHD risk while controlling for effects of prenatal and parental predictors on risk.; RESULTS: ADHD was more likely to be diagnosed in girls whose mothers or fathers were alcohol dependent, whose mothers reported heavy alcohol use during pregnancy, and in those with low birth weight. Controlling for other risk factors, risk was not significantly increased in those whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. After allowing for effects of prenatal and childhood predictors, 86% of the residual variance in ADHD risk was attributable to genetic effects and 14% to non-shared environmental influences.; CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal and parental risk factors may not be important mediators of influences on risk with much of the association between these variables and ADHD appearing to be indirect.

AB BACKGROUND: Little research has examined genetic and environmental contributions to psychopathic personality traits. Additionally, no studies have examined etiological connections between psychopathic traits and the broad psychopathological domains of internalizing (mood and anxiety) and externalizing (antisocial behavior, substance abuse). The current study was designed to fill these gaps in the literature.; METHOD: Participants were 626 pairs of 17-year-old male and female twins from the community. Psychopathic traits were indexed using scores on the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). Symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology were obtained via structured clinical interviews. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate genetic and environmental influences on psychopathic personality traits as well as the degree of genetic overlap between these traits and composites of internalizing and externalizing.; RESULTS: Twin analyses revealed significant genetic influence on distinct psychopathic traits (Fearless Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality). Moreover, Fearless Dominance was associated with reduced genetic risk for internalizing psychopathology, and Impulsive Antisociality was associated with increased genetic risk for externalizing psychopathology.; CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that different psychopathic traits as measured by the MPQ show distinct genetically based relations with broad dimensions of DSM psychopathology.

AB BACKGROUND: Homicide is the second leading cause of death in children aged 0 to 19 years. Tailoring violence prevention programs to high-risk individuals requires understanding victim-offender relationships.; OBJECTIVE: To elucidate differences in the relationships between homicide victims aged 0 to 19 years and their offenders.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using the Uniform Crime Reports: Supplemental Homicide Reports, 1976-1999.; SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Supplemental Homicide Reports contain incident-level information about criminal homicides, including location and victim and offender characteristics. National coverage is approximately 92%; 70 258 victims were studied.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in the relationships of homicide victims and offenders based on sex, age, population of homicide location, and weapon.; RESULTS: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Using strangers as the referent group, murdered girls were 3.6 (95% CI, 3.4-3.9) times more likely to have been killed by family members and 21.3 (95% CI, 18.5-24.4) times more likely to have been killed by intimate partners than murdered boys. Victims younger than 10 years were 33 (95% CI, 30.4-36.1) times more likely than victims older than 10 years to have been killed by a family member and 2.4 (95% CI, 2.2-2.6) times more likely to have been killed by someone else known to them. Stranger homicides occurred in areas with approximately 145 000 more residents (P<.01). Handguns were more likely to be used during homicides committed by strangers (P<.01). These associations remained after adjusting for potential confounders.; CONCLUSIONS: Future violence prevention programs may have more effect when targeted to specific sex and age groups. Elucidation of the origins of sex differences, focus on evidence-based child abuse prevention efforts, and enforcement of current gun control laws may help reduce the number of homicides among children.

AB ISSUE ADDRESSED: To assess whether the strategies used to sell the 'ready-to-drink' (RTD) category of alcoholic beverages is contributing to alcohol-related harm among adolescents.; METHODS: An initial investigation of bottleshops, which included an observational study designed to analyse methods employed by the liquor industry to market RTDs in bottleshops, on the central coast of New South Wales. We measured the number of glass-door display refrigerators to determine refrigerated space allocated to display RTDs compared with other alcoholic products. This measure was used to establish a quantitative baseline as an indicator for the in-store marketing of these products. We then randomly selected a dozen bottleshops from those previously visited and conducted semi-structured interviews with the staff.; RESULTS: The display of colourful, youth-oriented products and packaging in glass-door display refrigerators appears to be the primary in-store method for marketing RTD products. More than 40% of all glass-door display refrigerators in bottleshops on the central coast are dedicated to the storage and display of RTDs. More than half of the staff interviewed at bottleshops reported they believed that RTD products were marketed to under 18s, particularly girls.; CONCLUSION: There is already a high level of consumption of RTDs by under 18s. There is very strong marketing of these products by the liquor industry. This trend will further compound the already high-risk level of consumption of these products by young people.

AB The rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents is alarming, particularly in light of its many medical and psychosocial consequences. In this review, we discuss key concepts of nutrition and physical activity. Etiology, prevention, and treatment strategies are also discussed, focusing on the macronutrient content of the diet, portion control, meal patterns, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors. Television viewing, lack of physical activity, and intake of fast food and soft drinks are also examined as potential contributing factors in the obesity epidemic. Children should be helped to develop healthy nutrition and exercise habits early, since interventions are most effective when behaviors are still being formed.

AB Recent political, economic, and cultural changes in Mongolia make its large proportion of young people vulnerable to HIV infection. While there had been only two clinical cases of HIV in Mongolia by the year 2000, the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is on the rise, especially among people aged 15-24. Little is known about the social and cultural context in which the sexual knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of Mongolian young people are created and negotiated. This context must be better understood in order to promote safer sex practices. This study employed qualitative research methods to explore and describe the social and cultural context in which sexual behaviour is negotiated among secondary school students in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Students and teachers from two schools in Ulaanbaatar and health professionals were selected by purposeful sampling to participate in six semi-structured focus group interviews in autumn 2000. Thematic content analysis was conducted on the focus group transcripts. Seven themes were extracted including embarrassment, lack of knowledge, concepts of sex, perceptions of condoms, gender roles, peer norms, and the influence of drinking on sexual activity. Results presented are the first description of the social and cultural context of sexual health and highlight the combined impact of these themes on safer sex practices in Mongolia. These findings are not generalizable, but their agreement with the Mongolian and the international literature indicates that they may be transferable. Implications for STI and HIV/AIDS prevention efforts and further research in Mongolia are discussed.

AB We measured lead and mercury in samples collected from 31 homes in communities near the former Clark Air Base, Philippines during May and October 2002. Sample media included water used for drinking and cooking, house dust and entryway soil. Composite samples of 15 food items purchased at local markets were also collected. Samples were analyzed for total lead (Pb) and total mercury (Hg) to evaluate the relative importance of each media to residential exposure concentrations in the community adjacent to Clark (Community A) versus a control community 5 km away (Community B). In general, we measured low (e.g. background) to undetectable levels of the target analytes in all media sampled with two important exceptions. First, the Hg concentrations we measured in canned mackerel composites, which were within the range reported for mackerel from other locations worldwide, may pose a risk to pregnant women who are frequent consumers (e.g. one or more cans per day). Second, we measured Pb above the USEPA residential screening concentration (400 mug/g) in dust and soil from two homes, illustrating the need for periodic residential lead monitoring in these and other communities in the Philippines. We found no significant difference between Communities A and B with respect to Pb and Hg concentrations in water or food, although we were not able to detect very low levels of Pb in most of the foods we sampled because of trace Pb contamination added during sample homogenization. Although the Pb levels we measured in dust and soil from Community A homes were higher on average than Community B homes, the levels in both communities were low (e.g. background) thus we did not investigate the difference further. To our knowledge, these are the first reported measurements of Pb in house dust in the Philippines. The concentrations of Pb we measured in house dust were significantly higher than those in entryway soil from both communities, adding empirical support to the assertion that yard soil should not be considered a proxy for house dust in exposure studies in the Philippines or elsewhere.

AB AIMS: Previous research has shown that heavier drinkers, in comparison to light drinkers or abstainers, are more likely to favour increased access to alcohol and relaxation of control policies. Often, studies have not examined whether attitudes to alcohol policies vary according to a respondent's pattern of drinking. This study examined the association between drinking variables and views on policy, using six drinking variables and six topics on alcohol policy.; METHODS: Data were available from two Ontario surveys conducted in 2000 and 2002, which took representative samples of adults, aged 18 and older, selected by random digit dialling, who participated in interviews over the telephone (n = 1294 and 1206, respectively). Drinking variables include drinking status, drinking frequency, usual number of drinks, typical weekly volume, frequency of 5+ drinks per occasion and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores. Six policy items were examined: alcohol taxes, warning labels, density of retail alcohol outlets, privatization of government liquor stores, alcohol advertising and consultation with health experts on decisions on alcohol policy. Logistic regression analyses included five demographic variables: gender, age, marital status, education and income.; RESULTS: Among males, there was strong support for increased access to alcohol and fewer controls over alcohol policies. This relationship, although not as strong, also emerged for frequent consumers, high volume drinkers and those with a higher AUDIT score.; CONCLUSION: Whether it is intentional or not, government policies that tend to make alcohol more available cater to young, heavy-drinking males who possibly experience problems in connection with their drinking behaviour.

AB OBJECTIVE: At-risk consumption of alcohol has increasingly become the focus of primary and secondary prevention efforts. Little is known about the co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders with at-risk drinking. We examined patterns of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, (DSM-IV) lifetime co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in individuals in the general population with at-risk consumption of alcohol, alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence and moderate drinking/abstention, considering potential gender differences.; METHOD: Cross-sectional data of a representative general population-based study were analyzed. Based on DSM-IV criteria, participants aged 18-64 (N = 4,074; 2,045 men) were diagnosed using a standardized computer-assisted version of the Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). Nonpsychotic Axis-I lifetime diagnoses were examined. At-risk consumption of alcohol was defined as an average of more than 20 g (0.71 oz) pure alcohol consumption per day for women and 30 g (1.06 oz) for men, with alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence excluded.; RESULTS: Almost 9% of participants were identified as at-risk drinkers. Prevalence rates for at-risk drinkers were 16.9% for affective, 18.1% for anxiety and 17.8% for somatoform disorders. Compared with moderate drinkers/abstainers, at-risk drinkers showed a twofold increased risk of having a psychiatric disorder. Subjects with alcohol abuse showed a comparable level of risk and individuals with alcohol dependence showed an even greater risk. Female at-risk drinkers were twice as likely to have a psychiatric disorder as their male counterparts. The odds ratios for psychiatric disorders in at-risk drinkers compared with moderate drinkers/abstainers, however, did not differ in men and women.; CONCLUSIONS: Rates of psychiatric co-occurrence among at-risk drinkers were considerably elevated when compared with moderate drinkers/abstainers. These findings underline the relevance of at-risk consumption of alcohol and represent an important challenge to public health efforts regarding screening of psychiatric disorders and referral to appropriate treatment services.

AB The current study examined demographic, behavior, belief, and social influence characteristics of adolescents who use various means to get cigarettes and alcohol. Spring 1998 survey participants were 7302 6th, 8th, and 10th grade public school students from throughout Illinois, who self-identified as tobacco smokers and/or alcohol drinkers. The sample was not random, but closely matched the demographic composition of the state. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the effect of each independent variable on each of the cigarette sources and each of the alcohol sources. For both cigarettes and alcohol, adolescents used commercial sources far less than they did social sources such as family and friends. Also, older adolescents and those who are heavier and more entrenched smokers or drinkers were more likely to use both commercial and social sources. Other factors related to use of various sources included beliefs, social influences, and environmental influences. These findings have many implications for intervention, especially by parents and policymakers, and suggest an increased emphasis on social sources adolescents use to obtain cigarettes and alcohol.

AB Obesity in children and adolescents has reached alarming levels--20%-25% of children and adolescents are overweight or obese, and 4.9% of boys and 5.4% of girls are obese. Rates of obesity have increased significantly in Australia from 1985 to 1995, with the prevalence of overweight doubling and obesity trebling. Body mass index (related to reference standards for age and sex) is recommended as a practical measure of overweight and obesity in children, and is used in monitoring individual progress in clinical practice. Obesity in childhood and adolescence may be associated with a range of medical and psychological complications, and can predispose individuals to serious health problems in adult life, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity interventions for which there is some evidence include family support, a developmentally appropriate approach, long-term behaviour modification, dietary change, and increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behaviour. Prevention of obesity in children and adolescents requires a range of strategies involving changes in both the microenvironment (eg, housing, neighbourhoods, recreational opportunities) and the macroenvironment (eg, food marketing, transport systems, urban planning).

AB AIMS: To examine the relationship between exposure to different forms of alcohol advertising and subsequent drinking among US adolescents and assess whether exposure to an alcohol and drug prevention program mitigates any such relationship.; DESIGN: Regression models with multiple control variables examined the relationship between exposure to alcohol advertising in grade 8 and grade 9 drinking for two groups of South Dakotan adolescents: (1) seventh-grade non-drinkers (n = 1206) and (2) seventh-grade drinkers (n = 1905). Interactions between the intervention program and the significant advertising predictors were tested.; SETTING: Forty-one middle schools in South Dakota, USA.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3111 seventh-graders followed through grade 9.; MEASUREMENTS: Advertising variables were constructed for four types of alcohol advertising-television, in-store displays, magazines and concession stands. Other predictors tested included measures tapping social influences, social bonds, problem behavior, alcohol beliefs, television exposure and demographics.; FINDINGS: For seventh-grade non-drinkers, exposure to in-store beer displays predicted drinking onset by grade 9; for seventh-grade drinkers, exposure to magazines with alcohol advertisements and to beer concession stands at sports or music events predicted frequency of grade 9 drinking. Although exposure to television beer advertising had a significant bivariate relationship with alcohol use for grade 7 non-drinkers, it was not a significant predictor of drinking for either group in multivariate analyses. Participation in the prevention program, ALERT Plus, reduced future drinking for both groups and counteracted the effect of in-store beer displays.; CONCLUSIONS: Several forms of alcohol advertising predict adolescent drinking; which sources dominate depends on the child's prior experience with alcohol. Alcohol prevention programs and policies should help children counter alcohol advertising from multiple sources and limit exposure to these sources.

AB BACKGROUND: This study examined the 5-year incidence and recurrence of male to female (MFPV) and female to male partner violence (FMPV) as well as their relationship with drinking and alcohol problems among intact couples in the United States.; METHODS: A national sample of couples 18 years of age or older were interviewed in 1995 and again in 2000.; RESULTS: Recurrence is slightly higher for FMPV (44%) than MFPV (39%), whereas incidence rates are similar for these two types of violence (MFPV, 5.7%; FMPV, 6%). Cross-tabulations show that a higher frequency of drinking five or more drinks on occasion is positively associated with the overall occurrence of MFPV and with both the recurrence and the overall occurrence of FMPV. Male alcohol problems are associated with a higher recurrence of MFPV and higher overall MFPV. Female alcohol problems are associated with incidence of FMPV. In multivariate analysis, black ethnicity, male unemployment, and severe physical abuse during childhood are associated with recurrence of MFPV. Black ethnicity, male unemployment, male employment status as "retired/other," female age, and couples in which the female drinks more are associated with recurrence of FMPV. Incidence of MFPV is associated with cohabitation, Hispanic ethnicity, and man's observation of violence between parents. Male unemployment, male observation of violence between parents, and man's drinking volume predict incidence of FMPV.; CONCLUSIONS: Volume of drinking is the only alcohol indicator associated with intimate partner violence once the effects of other factors are controlled in multivariate analysis. Both MFPV and FMPV are areas of health disparity across whites, blacks, and Hispanics. Factors of risk that predict recurrence and incidence can be identified and used in prevention efforts.

AB OBJECTIVES: We assessed young adults' exposure to the tobacco industry marketing strategy of sponsoring social events at bars, nightclubs, and college campuses.; METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2001 Harvard College Alcohol Study, a random sample of 10904 students enrolled in 119 nationally representative 4-year colleges and universities.; RESULTS: During the 2000-2001 school year, 8.5% of respondents attended a bar, nightclub, or campus social event where free cigarettes were distributed. Events were reported by students attending 118 of the 119 schools (99.2%). Attendance was associated with a higher student smoking prevalence after we adjusted for demographic factors, alcohol use, and recent bar/nightclub attendance. This association remained for students who did not smoke regularly before 19 years of age but not for students who smoked regularly by 19 years of age.; CONCLUSIONS: Attendance at a tobacco industry-sponsored event at a bar, nightclub, or campus party was associated with a higher smoking prevalence among college students. Promotional events may encourage the initiation or the progression of tobacco use among college students who are not smoking regularly when they enter college.

AB Alcohol abuse in pregnancy causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranging from discreet developmental problems to fetal alcohol syndrome. That is why pregnant women and the women considering pregnancy should abstain from alcohol. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders occur even after drinking at early stages of pregnancy when women are not aware of being pregnant. According to one study 75% Czech women drank alcohol before pregnancy and one third of them continued during first three months of pregnancy. According to new epidemiological data 83.4% of Czech women aged between 18 and 40 drank alcohol during the year preceeding the pregnancy. The prevention in this area in the Czech Republic is clearly not satisfactory, and it is complicated by the alcohol advertising targeted at women, low taxation of alcohol and other factors.

More significant reductions in drinking intentions were found when using appeals focusing on drinking rituals pertaining to Maturity/Order (older students drink moderately: "Don't drink like a freshman.") than to Transformation (desired personality and mood changes), Community (social bonding and camaraderie), or a no-message Control. Gender did not moderate this effect. Underage drinkers may drink, in part, to feel more "grown up." Emphasizing that more senior students actually drink responsibly may diminish this belief and result in reduced alcohol consumption among underage students.

AB The forced opening of Taiwan's tobacco market in 1987 has changed the smoking environment. This study analyzes the effects this market opening had on Taiwan's secular smoking rates over 15 years. The data sources used were consumer surveys conducted by the Taiwan Tobacco & Wine Monopoly Bureau 1964-1996, the 2001 National Health Interview Survey, and a series of annual per capita gross national product (GNP) data reported by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting & Statistics. After Taiwan's tobacco market was forced open in 1987 by the U.S. government in trade negotiations, smoking rates rose (7%-10% for males and 39%-75% for females) for the first three years. After the initial 3-year surge, smoking rates gradually declined to 1986 baseline rates or even lower for all groups except females aged 30 and younger, who have shown a small but steady increase in cigarette consumption. Results of multiple regression analysis showed per capita GNP and age to be the two major factors affecting smoking rate change after the Taiwan market opening. National tobacco control policies and campaigns seem to have an impact on tempering the effect of foreign tobacco imports in all groups, except young females, whose rise in smoking rate is significant and alarming.

AB BACKGROUND: Trauma is the number one cause of maternal death during pregnancy, but incidence of fetal loss exceeds maternal loss by more than 3 to 1. We hypothesized that we could identify women at risk for injury during pregnancy and focus our prevention efforts.; STUDY DESIGN: Women of childbearing age in the American College of Surgeon's National Trauma Data Bank served as the study population. Pregnant patients were compared with nonpregnant patients with respect to age, race, mechanism of injury, injury patterns and severity, risk-taking behaviors, and outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for loss of pregnancy in mothers who survived their trauma.; RESULTS: Pregnant trauma patients (n = 1,195) were younger, less severely injured, and more likely to be African American or Hispanic as compared with the nonpregnant cohort (n = 76,126). Twenty percent of injured pregnant patients tested positive for drugs or alcohol, and approximately one-third of those involved in motor vehicle crashes were not using seatbelts. Independent risk factors for fetal loss after trauma included Injury Severity Score > 15; Adjusted Injury Score > or = 3 in the head, abdomen, thorax, or lower extremities; and Glasgow Coma Score < or = 8.; CONCLUSIONS: Young, African-American, and Hispanic pregnant women are at higher risk for trauma in pregnancy and are most likely to benefit from primary trauma prevention efforts. Those with severe head, abdominal, thoracic, or lower extremity injuries are at high risk for pregnancy loss. Reduction of secondary insults and early recognition of fetal distress may improve outcomes for both the mother and fetus in this high-risk group.

AB The issue of care of a mother and a child appeared to be nothing new during the period of II Rzeczpospolita. It used to be one of the most vital problems of social policy of the country. It was the local governments, gmina. poviat's unions as well as the voivodship. Social Security Committees responsibility to protect motherhood and care for children imposed on them by the 16th August 1923 act. The regulation of Department of Public Health the city of Warsaw from 1929 stated in the 1st and that aforementioned care included: "sanitary, medical and nursery care provided by Department of Public Health information bureaus or the social institutions subsided by the magistrat and authorized by it". "Opiekun Spoleczny" as the monthly having dealt with the social policy issues in the capital city, in detail discussed certain problems of social and health care for a family, explained the valid legislation and informed about the new Health Department acts. The magazine was above all addressed to Health Department workers and social workers. The issue of care for a mother and a child used to be the leading subject-matter of the magazine since the beginnings of its existence. It was numerously pointed out that taking care for motherhood and a baby, a child at pre-school and school age and the youth is the main job of the care department. The material and moral relief used to be lead by the social workers. As far as the legal assistance is concerned, it was the special information bureaus workers' organized by Zarzad Miejski and "Osiedle" committee responsibility to help mothers in need. One of the most essential problems on one hand and the most difficult on the other faced by the capital city welfare was the problem of illegitimate children, especially the abandoned ones constituting a numerous group. The welfare's aim was to decrease their number and improve their living conditions. The main principle was to make each mother to raise her child on her own. That is why the abandoned children places were reorganized and transformed into the mother and child homes. A new institution was also created--it was the care for abandoned mothers existing near the workplaces. It were the principles then to create conditions efficient enough for the mother to live on her own. The material and legal relief was provided as well as mothers were helped in finding job. Taking care for a mother and her child used to be the field of social institutions. There were various social organizations such as Polish Care for a Child Committee, Polish Drop of Milk Society, Polish Society for Alcoholism Fight and so forth. It was their main aim to help mothers and children in poor living conditions.

AB INTRODUCTION: As children go through the transition from childhood to adolescence, many shifts occur in sleep/wake patterns related to intrinsic and extrinsic developmental changes. These shifts have been shown to result in corresponding shifts in sleep phase (later sleep onset) and sleep deprivation among teenagers in Western societies. However, the effect of these developmental changes on the sleep habits of Korean teenagers has not been analyzed. This study aims to quantify age-related changes in sleep/wake patterns among Korean teenagers and elucidate cultural and other factors causing these changes.; METHODS: The School Sleep Habits Survey was administered in homeroom classes to students in grades 5 to 12 (mean age: 13.7 +/- 2.4 years) selected via a 2-way stratification sampling method. The survey included items regarding usual sleep/wake patterns over the previous 2 weeks as well as measures of daytime sleepiness, sleep/wake-problem behavior, depressed mood, and morningness/eveningness.; RESULTS: A total of 1457 students (52.9% male) completed the survey. The higher the grade, the later bedtime was found to be on both school days and weekends. There was a similar relationship between increasing grade and earlier wake time on school days, but higher grades were associated with later wake time on weekends. Total sleep time decreased by approximately 3 hours on school nights and 1 hour on weekend nights from grades 5 to 12. Adolescents were severely sleep deprived, with mean school-night total sleep times of 6.02, 5.62, and 4.86 hours for 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders, respectively. In the higher grades, there was a greater discrepancy between school nights and weekends in terms of bedtime and wake time, and the magnitude of weekend oversleep increased. Older students also reported more daytime sleepiness, more sleep/wake-problem behavior, more depressed mood, and more eveningness preference. The chief reasons students cited for their sleep deprivation differed across grades: Academic demands and entertainment (such as Internet and television) were reported by 5th- and 6th-graders, entertainment and then academic demands by 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders, and early school start time and academic demands by 10th-, 11th- and 12th-graders.; CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly demonstrates that Korean adolescents do not get adequate sleep and that they have profound discrepancies in their sleep/wake patterns between school and weekend nights. Compared with previous studies from other countries, Korean students display even greater sleep deprivation and also more irregular sleep/wake patterns. This study also demonstrates that academic demands/stress and early school start time are the most important contributing factors for sleep deprivation among Korean adolescents. These findings stress the need to promote awareness of the magnitude of adolescent sleep deprivation and its detrimental effects in Korean society.

AB The Viral Hepatitis Prevention Board (VHPB) convened a meeting of international experts from the public and private sectors in the Nordic countries and Germany, in order to review the epidemiological situation, the surveillance systems for infectious diseases, the immunization programmes and policy, and the monitoring of adverse events after hepatitis vaccination in those countries, to evaluate prevention and control measures, and to identify the issues that arose and the lessons learnt. Considerable progress has been made in the past decades in the prevention and control of viral hepatitis in the respective countries. Vaccination programmes have been set up, blood products' safety has significantly been improved, and outbreak investigations remain the basis for the implementation of control measures. However, additional work remains to be done. Awareness of viral hepatitis among the public and professionals should further be raised, and more political support is needed regarding the value of prevention efforts and vaccination programmes.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of screening for sexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses and to study the profile of sexual activity and other risk behaviours in a senior high school population.; METHODS: In this descriptive study we provided sexual health education and screening to students from two senior high schools in the Australian Capital Territory. We collected behavioural data using a self-administered questionnaire. Urines and swabs were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), Neisseria gonorrhoea (Ng), Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv) and human papilloma virus (HPV). Blood specimens were tested for hepatitis B and C, HIV, herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and syphilis.; RESULTS: A total of 795 students participated (31% of the enrolled population; female to male ratio 60:40) and 67.0% were sexually active. Of 795 students, 644 (81.0%) were screened. Rates of infection were Ct 1.1% (95% CI: 0.4-2.6), HPV 11.7% (95% CI: 7.4-17.3), HSV-1 32.5% (95% CI: 28.9-36.3), HSV-2 2.4% (95% CI: 1.3-3.9), hepatitis B surface antigen 0.3% (95% CI: 0.04-1.1) and hepatitis C antibodies 0.7% (95% CI: 0.07-1.6). Only 22.3% (95% CI: 19.3-25.7) of students had immunity to hepatitis B. There were no cases of HIV, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis or syphilis. Of the sexually active students, 49.2% (95% CI: 38.9-59.2%) reported never or only sometimes using condoms, 41.5% (95% CI: 32.2-52.3%) reported unsafe drinking, 33.3% (95% CI: 23.9-43.1%) were smokers and 1.9% (95% CI: 0.2-7.0%) reported injecting drug use.; CONCLUSIONS: Rates of STI and blood-borne viruses and immunity to hepatitis B were low in this population, but unsafe sex and other risk behaviours were common. We have demonstrated that STI screening, including serological testing, was well accepted in a senior high school population.

AB Two anonymous population-based surveys were conducted between August 2001 and April 2002 using computer-assisted telephone interviews of 3793 male and 3244 female randomly selected residents of Hong Kong in order to estimate the prevalence of psychotropic substance use and identify risk factors and associations with health outcomes among users in Hong Kong. The study cohort was comprised of ethnically Chinese adults between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age. In the last 12 months, 5% of males and 1.8% of females had used psychotropic substances such as cannaboids, methylamphetamines, ketamines, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Of the male drug users, almost one-third had done so outside of Hong Kong. "Risk factors" for substance use included: younger age, unemployment, being an early school leaver, being unmarried, "heavy alcohol consumption," and smoking. Psychotropic substance use in the past year was strongly associated with increased prevalence of long-lasting (> or =3 months) sexual health problems during the past year and with a higher prevalence of HIV/STD risk behaviors. The prevalence of substance use in Hong Kong has been under-reported. Although significant correlations were noted between substance use and various respondent attributes, the directionality of the associations needs to be determined with longitudinal studies. It may be prudent to integrate substance use and HIV/STD prevention efforts.

Results of HGLM analyses (a generalization of HLM to accommodate nonlinear outcomes), controlling for the effect of school, indicate that Black students are less likely than White students to use club drugs depending on the timeframe of use. The use of alcohol and/or marijuana predict club drug use regardless of the timeframe of use, and lifetime cigarette use predicts lifetime club drug use. Recommendations for future research and prevention efforts are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: Portrayals of the use of over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics on television may stimulate their use.; OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between taking OTC analgesics and television viewing by adolescents.; METHODS: A standardized self-administered questionnaire among first-year (mean age 13.16 y) and fourth-year (mean age 16.37 y) secondary students in Flanders, Belgium (n = 2546) was administered in a school setting. The independent variable was television viewing; control variables were school year, gender, drinking alcohol, days off sick, computer gaming, and Internet use. The main outcome variable was monthly use of OTC analgesics.; RESULTS: On average, respondents watched 3 hours 18 minutes of television per day (boys more than girls, first-year students more than fourth-year students). Per additional hour of television per day, the odds that respondents were regular users of analgesics were 1.16 times higher (95% CI 1.08 to 1.24). For the 10% heaviest viewers, the odds were 2.30 times higher (95% CI 1.25 to 4.24) compared with the 10% lightest viewers. Odds of OTC analgesic use were higher for students reporting more sick days in the past year (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.49), regular users of alcohol (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.50), and girls (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.73).; CONCLUSIONS: A relationship was found between watching television and the use of OTC analgesics, even after controlling for gender and lifestyle measures. More research is needed to establish whether this relationship is causal.

AB INTRODUCTION: In substance abusing families, sources of familial comorbidity are potentially confounded by genetic-environmental (GE) interplays. The children-of-twins (COT) design can be used to elucidate the association of a parental trait and an offspring outcome such as the association of parental alcoholism and offspring suicidality.; METHODS: We examined the association of paternal alcoholism and offspring suicidal behaviors in an adolescent and young adult COT sample of 'Vietnam Era Twins' offspring who had completed an interview including a comprehensive assessment of lifetime suicidal behaviors. We stratified the COT sample into four groups contingent upon paternal zygosity, MZ versus DZ, and lifetime paternal alcohol dependence history (AD), positive versus negative. We examined whether the relationship of paternal alcoholism and offspring suicidality was best explained by genetic predispositions common to alcoholism and suicidality or by GE interplay--environmental influences correlated with parental alcoholism or the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.; RESULTS: Our results suggest a main effect of paternal alcoholism on offspring suicide attempt; COT analyses do not support a purely genetic explanation for this association.; DISCUSSION: Suicide attempts probably result from GE interplays and must be studied in genetically informative samples of offspring of substance abusing parents.

AB Alcohol and drug use are considered to be risk factors for suicidal behaviors in adolescence, but the precise nature of the relationship between suicidality and substance abuse, and the implications of this relationship for prevention and treatment interventions remain elusive. There are several conceptual issues that need to be addressed when considering the substance abuse-suicidality relationship. What are the most appropriate ways of defining suicidal behaviors? What are the best ways of assessing suicidal behavior and characterizing its course over time? Should adolescents who are suicidal be considered to be a single homogeneous population? What are the possible ways in which the course of substance abuse and suicidality over time are related? What factors potentially affect the trajectories of both substance abuse and suicidality? Does the relationship between substance abuse and suicidality change over time? And, to what extent can our knowledge of factors precipitating and maintaining the joint outcomes of suicidal and substance abuse behaviors be incorporated into interventions that target both? Careful consideration and exploration of these issues hopefully should improve our understanding the substance abuse-suicidality interrelationship, and ultimately the development of more effective prevention efforts and treatments for youths with both problems.

Grounded theory content analyses were performed on qualitative interviews conducted with 80 men, aged 18 to 29, in four U.S. states. Participants believed that drugs were easily available in prison. Half reported using substances, primarily marijuana or alcohol, while incarcerated. Key themes included the role of correctional personnel in the flow of substances in prison and the economic significance of substance trafficking. With regard to sexual behavior, most men acknowledged that it occurred but were hesitant to talk in-depth about it. There was a strong belief in "don't look, don't tell," and sex in prison was often associated with homosexual behavior or identity. Sex during incarceration was reported by 12 men, mostly with female partners. Participants were pessimistic about HIV/STD/hepatitis prevention efforts inside correctional facilities. These findings highlight the need for risk reduction programs for incarcerated men.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of information on the extent of knowledge about mental illness and attitudes toward the mentally ill in Fiji.; AIMS: This study aimed to explore these aspects, and also to determine the factors influencing them.; METHOD: Market vendors, peri-urban dwellers, white-collar and health workers from Greater Suva were interviewed. The interview schedule used elicited socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of, and attitudes toward, mental illness.; RESULTS: A majority of the subjects attributed the cause of mental illness to substance abuse, believed in the diversity of mental illness, considered hospital as an important source of help and acknowledged the effectiveness of medication. Less than one-fifth of the subjects were willing to marry or employ mentally ill persons. About 42% of the sample would be deterred by embarrassment from seeking help. Educational attainment was correlated with knowledge about mental illness, except with knowledge about early mental symptoms (p < 0.01). Prestigious occupation, single marital status, female gender, younger age and urban dwelling were associated with positive disposition toward the mentally ill (p < 0.01). Race was not significantly influential on almost all attitudinal variables.; CONCLUSION: Health education is capable of positively influencing knowledge about, and attitudes toward, mental illness in Fiji.

Both British American Tobacco and Philip Morris used Malaysian television to advertise into Singapore. To launch a new brand of cigarettes, Alpine, Philip Morris used a non-tobacco product, the Alpine wine cooler. Other creative strategies such as innovative packaging and display units at retailers were explored to overcome the restrictions. Philip Morris experimented with developing a prototype cigarette using aroma and sweetened tipping paper to target the young and health conscious. The industry sought to weaken the strong pack warnings. The industry distributed anti-smoking posters for youth to retailers but privately salivated over their market potential.

AB AIMS: We examined risky drinking and alcohol use patterns associated with prenatal effects of alcohol exposure in women of childbearing age, using various definitions of low-risk drinking.; DESIGN: Computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) methodology was used to gather information in a cross-sectional survey on alcohol use and problems, pregnancy and likelihood of future pregnancy.; SETTING: Participants were respondents in the 2000 National Alcohol Survey (NAS, N10, response rate 58%) which includes men and women from all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1504 women aged 18-39 years were included; 72 were pregnant, 511 were currently not pregnant but reported being likely to be pregnant in the next 5 years, and 921 women were neither pregnant nor likely to be in the next 5 years.; MEASUREMENTS: Various alcohol use patterns in the past 12 months including average volume, amount per session, drinking with food and time spent drinking were assessed.; FINDINGS: Seven per cent of childbearing age women exceeded guidelines used to classify women as risky drinkers in the past month. Thirty per cent were classified as risky drinkers when these guidelines were extended to past-year drinking. Examination of specific alcohol use patterns revealed that while under 10% of risky drinkers reported past-month heavy episodic drinking, 30% or more reported heavy episodic drinking and exceeding daily limits for alcohol consumption in the past year.; CONCLUSIONS: Public health professionals should note that past-year drinking in a significant proportion of women of childbearing age exceeds guidelines for alcohol use. When targeting such prevention efforts, they should thus include assessment of past-year alcohol use patterns.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic influences have been shown to play a major role in determining the risk of alcohol dependence (AD) in both women and men; however, little attention has been directed to identifying the major sources of genetic variation in AD risk.; METHOD: Diagnostic telephone interview data from young adult Australian twin pairs born between 1964 and 1971 were analyzed. Cox regression models were fitted to interview data from a total of 2708 complete twin pairs (690 MZ female, 485 MZ male, 500 DZ female, 384 DZ male, and 649 DZ female/male pairs). Structural equation models were fitted to determine the extent of residual genetic and environmental influences on AD risk while controlling for effects of sociodemographic and psychiatric predictors on risk.; RESULTS: Risk of AD was increased in males, in Roman Catholics, in those reporting a history of major depression, social anxiety problems, and conduct disorder, or (in females only) a history of suicide attempt and childhood sexual abuse; but was decreased in those reporting Baptist, Methodist, or Orthodox religion, in those who reported weekly church attendance, and in university-educated males. After allowing for the effects of sociodemographic and psychiatric predictors, 47 % (95% CI 28-55) of the residual variance in alcoholism risk was attributable to additive genetic effects, 0% (95% CI 0-14) to shared environmental factors, and 53% (95% CI 45-63) to nonshared environmental influences.; CONCLUSIONS: Controlling for other risk factors, substantial residual heritability of AD was observed, suggesting that psychiatric and other risk factors play a minor role in the inheritance of AD.

AB The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children is increasing rapidly. This is alarming because obesity is associated with severe chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Obesity at young age is related to obesity at adult age. Consequently, the prevention of overweight from childhood onwards is an important issue. Apart from diabetes mellitus type 2 there is an increased risk of orthopaedic complications, respiratory problems, fertility problems, cardiovascular diseases and psychosocial consequences in the form of a negative self-image, emotional and behavioural problems and depression. Environmental and behavioural factors are regarded as the most important causes of the rapid increase in the prevalence of overweight and as the most important starting points for prevention. Most prevention programmes are still in the initial stages. Prevention programmes aimed at stimulating breast feeding and daily physical activity (playing outside) and the restriction of sweetened drinks and watching TV are very promising. With such preventive measures the involvement of both the school and the parents is important.

AB BACKGROUND: Alcohol misuse and conduct disorder (CD) are strongly associated in adolescents. Is their association due to shared genetic and environmental liabilities? We addressed that question with data obtained from structured interviews of 14-year-old Finnish twins.; METHODS: A total of 1854 twins completed face-to-face interviews. Univariate models, allowing for sex limitation, were fit to symptom counts for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised diagnoses of CD and alcoholism to examine their genetic and environmental influences. Then, bivariate models evaluated the extent to which genetic and environmental influences contributed to the covariation between symptom counts for the two disorders.; RESULTS: A total of 822 twins (44% of the sample) reported one or more symptoms of CD; alcohol dependence symptoms were much less common, reported by only 12%. The correlation between the two symptom counts was 0.50. Models fit to the twin data demonstrated that CD symptoms were under significant genetic influence in both boys and girls, although those influences were predominantly sex specific. In contrast, alcohol dependence symptoms were, at this age, under sex-specific effects of common environments, with no evidence of genetic influences. Accordingly, the substantial covariation between alcohol dependence symptoms and those of CD was attributed entirely to shared environmental effects.; CONCLUSIONS: At age 14, genetic influences on alcohol dependence symptoms are negligible, and the correlated liabilities between these symptoms and those of CD are to be found in environmental factors that are common to both.

AB The increased prevalence and costs associated with the obesity epidemic have made preventive efforts a public health priority. Public health has historically relied on a series of targeted regulations, taxes, and education efforts to curb epidemics, and will rely on similar strategies to combat obesity. We argue that interventions targeted at youth are relatively easy to justify on economic grounds due to the additional protections that this group requires, but that justification for government interventions aimed at curbing obesity among adults requires additional evidence that private markets are not functioning properly. We then present seven proposed intervention strategies to promote healthy eating, and use an economic framework to discuss the relative merits of the interventions. This evaluation will allow policymakers to make more informed decisions concerning the relative merits of these strategies in combating the obesity epidemic.

AB The present study examines the energy intake resulting from eating snacks and drinking energy containing drinks while watching television. 2546 first and fourth year students in a random sample of 15 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium received quantifiable, closed survey questions about average weekly TV viewing volume and about eating five types of snacks and drinking two types of soft drinks. On an average, the respondents watched 22:27 h of television per week (SD = 11:53). Only 3.5% of the adolescents never eat snacks or drink soft drinks while they watch TV. Estimated daily energy intake accompanying TV viewing amounts to 19% of the Belgian average energy allowance (AEA) in boys and between 12 and 14% of AEA in girls. On an average 1 h of watching television equals the consumption of 653 kJ.

AB Carbonated beverages have been reported to increase fracture risk in children but the mechanism is unclear. The aim of this population-based case-control study was to investigate the association between soft drink and milk consumption, physical activity, bone mass, and upper limb fractures in children aged 9-16 years. A total of 206 fracture cases and 206 randomly selected individually matched controls were studied. There were 47 hand fractures; 128 wrist and forearm fractures, and 31 upper arm fractures. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilized to retrospectively assess last-year physical activity (including television, computer, and video watching) and to recall the average weekly consumption of milk, colas, and total carbonated drinks. Bone mass at the spine, hip, and total body was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and metacarpal morphometry. For total fractures, none of the above drink types was significantly different between cases and controls. For wrist and forearm fractures, there was a positive association between cola drink consumption and fracture risk (OR 1.39/unit, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.91). Cola consumption was significantly correlated with television, computer, and video watching (r = 0.20, P = 0.001) but not bone mineral density or milk drinks. After adjustment for television, computer, and video watching and bone mineral density, the association between cola drinks and fracture risk became nonsignificant (OR 1.31/unit, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.83). No association with other fracture sites was observed. In conclusion, cola, but not total carbonated beverage consumption, is associated with increased wrist and forearm fracture risk in children. However, this association is not independent of other factors and appears to be mediated by television watching and bone mineral density but not by decreased milk intake.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widespread mycotoxin which contaminates food such as cereals, beer, coffee, wine and products of animal origin. OTA is known for its nephrotoxic, immunotoxic and carcinogenic properties. The prevalence of OTA in human blood and foodstuffs has been investigated in many countries. In this study, exposure of the Lebanese population to OTA was evaluated and the contamination of the most commonly consumed foods in Lebanon by OTA was assessed. Plasma samples from healthy individuals and also cereals and beer samples obtained from markets were collected from the different regions of Lebanon. OTA was detectable in 33% of tested plasma samples (n =250) with a concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.87 ng/mL and a mean of 0.17+/-0.01ng/mL. No sex and age differences were found. The frequency of OTA-positive plasma samples obtained in the South of Lebanon and in the Bekaa valley (50 and 47%, respectively) was significantly higher compared to plasma samples obtained in the Beirut/Mount Lebanon region (19%). Food analyses showed that wheat, burghul and beer were contaminated with a mean value of 0.15+/-0.03 microg/kg, 0.21+/-0.04 microg/kg and 0.19+/-0.12 ng/mL, respectively. These data suggest that the Lebanese population is exposed to OTA through food ingestion at concentrations lower than the tolerable daily intake.

AB EDITOR'S NOTE: The problem of childhood obesity is accelerating throughout the world. The following is a position paper from The European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG) that outlines the nature of the problem of childhood obesity along with treatment and prevention methods available today. The paucity of literature on prevention and treatment of obesity in children as documented in this paper points out the need for much additional research on obesity in children.; OBJECTIVES: The awareness of childhood obesity as a major health problem and an uncontrolled worldwide epidemic has to be increased in the society.; DESIGN: In order to improve the quality of the health care and to minimize the cost it is important to investigate and standardize pediatric obesity prevention and treatment and to adapt to social and cultural aspects.; RESULTS: Obesity is the result of excess body fat. The different norms and definitions in Europe and the US is described and clarified. However, the available methods for the direct measurement of body fat are not easily used in daily practice. For this reason, obesity is often assessed by means of indirect estimates of body fat, that is, anthropometrics. There are essentially six relevant levels, which could be involved in prevention of child and adolescent obesity: family (child, parents, siblings, etc), schools, health professionals, government, industry and media. Evidence-based health promotion programs has to be given a high priority. Government should encourage media increase information about healthy nutrition and to avoid the marketing of unhealthy foods including sweet drinks, for example, in TV. Many different approaches of treatments of obesity have been investigated, including diet, exercise, behavioral therapy, surgery, and medication. None have been found to be effective enough as sole tools in children. This has led to focus on multidisciplinary programs especially involving families. Behavioral cognitive therapy is effective in treating childhood obesity as is family therapy. Surgery and drug treatment cannot be recommended without additional research. Clinicians should consider the various factors that can influence body composition.; CONCLUSION: It is important to know and to follow nutritional factors, energy intake and composition of the diet, nutrition and hormonal status, food preferences and behavior, and the influence of non-nutritional factors. We recommend that obesity should be the major priority both in the health care system, on the scientific level and for future political actions.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is now the leading notifiable disease in Australia. The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and associated risk behaviors among injecting drug users (IDUs) screened in south-western Sydney as part of a multisite prospective cohort study.; METHODS: Using a combination of snowball sampling and word-of-mouth recruitment strategies, 377 IDUs were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and tested for exposure to HCV and HBV. Entry criteria were injecting drug use in the previous 6 months and antibody HCV serostatus not known to be positive.; RESULTS: More than one-third (36.6%) tested HCV antibody positive and one-quarter (28%) had been exposed to HBV. Independent predictors of HCV seropositivity were HBV core antibody positive serostatus, incarceration in the past year, injecting in public, Asian ethnicity and duration of injecting. Individual risk behaviors, including sharing needles and syringes, sharing other injecting equipment and being injected by others, were not significant in either bivariate or multivariate models.; CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate an urgent need for structural interventions designed to reduce the exposure of IDUs, particularly indigenous Australian and Asian injectors, to risk environments. Structural interventions, including population-based hepatitis B immunization, expanded access to needle and syringe programs and drug treatment, prison diversion programs and medically supervised injecting facilities, should be incorporated into existing blood-borne virus prevention efforts.

AB This paper evaluates three approaches to compulsory breath testing (CBT) where all drivers stopped are tested: (1) intensive, moderate-profile CBT (plus zero alcohol tolerance for drivers under age 20, which was implemented simultaneously, remains in effect, and unavoidably is commingled with CBT in the effectiveness estimates); (2) CBT plus an enhanced media campaign; and (3) shifting to aggressively visible booze buses, which also streamlined drunk-driver processing, plus enhanced community campaigns against drunk-driving. Approaches 1 and 2 were implemented throughout New Zealand (NZ) in 1993 and 1995. Booze buses and community programs were added for about one-third of the country in late 1996. ARIMA time series models estimated the impact on serious and fatal injury crashes between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m., a proxy for alcohol-related crashes. A benefit-cost analysis assessed return on investment. Cost savings were analyzed from four perspectives: societal, governmental, drunk-drivers', and people other than drunk-drivers (external cost). CBT plus zero tolerance reduced expected night-time crashes by 22.1% and enhanced media by 13.9%. Booze buses yielded a further 27.4% reduction where implemented. The program and associated crash reduction persisted until at least 2001 (the most recent data available). Estimated societal benefit-cost ratios were 14 for CBT, 19 for CBT plus enhanced media, and 26 for the comprehensive package. Government saved more than it spent on the program, especially with booze buses. Aggressive CBT plus zero alcohol tolerance for youth, media blitzes, and booze buses proved dramatically effective. Together, these four interventions halved late night serious and fatal injury crashes. Sustained effort seems to be critical. Better outcomes may be achieved with staged, increasingly visible and inescapable checkpoints than with an "ideal" initial program. It appears CBT is best implemented in conjunction with broader community-centered efforts to reduce drunk-driving. Copyright 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The numbers of participating twin pairs at ages 3, 7, 10, and 12 were 5,602, 5,115, 2,956, and 1,481, respectively. Stability in both behaviors was accounted for by genetic and shared environmental influences. The genetic contribution to stability (INT: 43%; EXT: 60%) resulted from the fact that a subset of genes expressed at an earlier age was still active at the next time point. A common set of shared environmental factors operated at all ages (INT: 47%; EXT: 34%). The modest contribution of nonshared environmental factors (INT: 10%; EXT: 6%) could not be captured by a simple model. Significant age-specific influences were found for all components, indicating that genetic and environmental factors also contributed to changes in problem behavior.

AB In 2002 Wicked Holdings Pty Ltd, a company formed for the purpose of marketing alcoholic milk, applied to the Director of Liquor Licensing Victoria (LLV) for a wholesale licence to distribute a beverage known as 'Moo Joose'. This article outlines the case against alcoholic milk as the ultimate 'alcopop'. The argument encompasses the risk that alcoholic milk would reinforce and increase existing levels of under-age drinking in Australia, the risk it would reduce the age of initiation into drinking and the potential for alcoholic milk to be mistaken for a 'healthy' version of alcohol and a 'safe' alcoholic beverage. When LLV refused the application for a licence, Wicked Holdings appealed to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Following a public hearing the Tribunal confirmed LLV's decision to refuse a licence on the grounds the product posed an unacceptable risk to the health and well-being of young people.

AB The percentage of US adolescents who are overweight or at-risk of overweight has increased over the past 20 years. Using data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988-1994, multivariate regression models of body mass index (BMI) for adolescent males and females aged 12-16 years were developed to examine the relative importance of demographics, beverage consumption, physical activity, and sedentary behavior for maintaining a healthy body weight. The models explained between 11% and 19% of the variance in BMI. Demographic characteristics accounted for roughly one-half of the explained variance in the models. Age was positively associated with BMI for males and females. Family income had a negative association with BMI for females, but no association with BMI for males. The variables for race/ethnicity and region were only occasionally statistically significant. A strong negative association was found between BMI and participation in team sports or exercise programs for both males and females. The estimate of the relationship between television viewing and BMI was positive but not statistically significant. Consumption of regular carbonated soft drinks (RCSD) and fruit drinks/ades--two beverages widely hypothesized to be positively associated with BMI--were not statistically significant in any of the models. Consumption of diet carbonated soft drinks was very low and was positively associated with BMI for females but not for males. The potential impacts of increasing participation in teams or exercise programs, reducing television viewing, and reducing RCSD consumption on BMI were examined. Increasing participation in teams or exercise programs consistently had the largest impact on reducing predicted BMI. The impact of reducing television viewing had the next largest impact. Reducing consumption of RCSD had the smallest impact. Policies that revitalize physical activity and physical education programs for all students--not just student athletes--and educational efforts that discourage sedentary behavior will be far more successful in combating overweight than an undue focus on beverage consumption.

The original Project Northland was successful in reducing alcohol use among a sample of mostly White, rural adolescents.; METHODS: We highlight the steps taken to adapt the intervention strategies for culturally diverse inner-city youth, families, and neighborhoods. The research design is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the adapted Project Northland for reducing the early onset and prevalence of alcohol use among young urban adolescents.; CONCLUSION: The information gained from this trial, including the process of adaptation of prevention strategies, will be beneficial for alcohol-use prevention efforts within diverse urban communities across the country.

AB The dichotomous variable "binge drinking" and its associated outcomes may be insufficient for understanding the drinking phenomenon on college campuses. The current study examined the behavioral outcomes associated with different drinking nights (light, typical, and heavy) in an effort to more closely examine collegiate drinking behavior. Data were collected from 236 university students, including hourly drinking rate, estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was computed, and outcomes for each drinking night. Students reported drinking behavior that ranged from weekly "light night" drinking (average: 2.85 drinks, 3.34 h, end of night BAC = 0.04%) to biweekly "heavy nights" (average: 9.91 drinks, 4.93 h, end of night BAC = 0.25%). Students report encountering the greatest number of negative outcomes during heavy drinking nights, while light nights were found to have the fewest associated negative outcomes. Positive outcomes were highest on "typical" nights, although effect sizes were small. These data suggest that prevention efforts may be more successful if types of drinking night and positive outcomes become a stronger focus. Limitations and directions for future programming and research are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with nonalcoholic carbonated beverage (soft drink) consumption in children.; DESIGN: Mail-in surveys collected by Dragonfly, a children's educational magazine distributed nationally to elementary and middle schools, were analyzed. The survey included questions about frequency of soft drink consumption and factors related to soft drink consumption.; SUBJECTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 560 children, 8 to 13 years old, who completed and mailed in the survey. There was an equal distribution of boys and girls (51% and 49%, respectively).; STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Frequency distributions were calculated and chi(2) tests were conducted to determine whether soft drink consumption and related factors varied by sex and age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of soft drink consumption with each factor after adjustment for potential confounders.; RESULTS: Preference for the taste of soft drinks was the strongest predictor in the analysis, with those who reported the strongest taste preference 4.50 times more likely (95% confidence interval=2.89-7.04) to consume soft drinks five or more times per week than those with a lower taste preference. Youth whose parents regularly drank soft drinks were 2.88 times more likely (95% confidence interval=1.76-4.72) to consume soft drinks five or more times per week compared with those whose parents did not regularly drink soft drinks.; CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that several factors may be associated with soft drink intake in school-aged children, most notably taste preferences, soft drink consumption habits of parents and friends, soft drink availability in the home and school, and television viewing. Additional research is needed to verify these findings in a representative sample of children.

AB This study addresses binge drinking in college as a risk factor for heavy drinking and alcohol dependence after college. A national probability sample of 1972 college students from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY79) was interviewed in 1984 and reinterviewed again as adults in 1994. The short-term effects of binge drinking in college were assessed as well as the extent to which experiences of negative effects in college predicted patterns of alcohol use across the transition from college into postcollege years. As expected, college binge drinkers were comparatively more likely than nonbinge drinkers to experience one or more alcohol-related problems while in college. In addition, weighted estimates of DSM-IV-defined diagnostic criteria in logistic regression models indicated that the binge drinking patterns exhibited during the college years, for some former college students of both genders, posed significant risk factors for alcohol dependence and abuse 10 years after the initial interview, in conjunction with evidence of academic attrition, early departure from college and less favorable labor market outcomes.

AB AIMS: To examine the relationship between alcohol outlet density and violent crime controlling for neighbourhood sociostructural characteristics and the effects of spatially autocorrelated error.; DESIGN: The sample for this ecologic study comprised 188 census tracts from the City of Austin, Texas and 263 tracts from the City of San Antonio, Texas. Data pertaining to neighbourhood social structure, alcohol density and violent crime were collected from archival sources, and analysed using bivariate, multivariate and geospatial analyses.; RESULTS: Using ordinary least squares analysis, the neighbourhood sociostructural covariates explained close to 59% of the variability in violent crime rates in Austin and close to 39% in San Antonio. Adding alcohol outlet density in the target and adjacent census tracts improved the explanatory power of both models. Alcohol outlet density in the target census tract remained a significant predictor of violent crime rates in both cities when the effects of autocorrelated error were controlled for. In Austin, the effects of alcohol outlet density in the adjacent census tracts also remained significant. The final model explains 71% of the variance in violent crime in Austin and 56% in San Antonio.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings show a clear association between alcohol outlet density and violence, and suggest that the issues of alcohol availability and access are fundamental to the prevention of alcohol-related problems within communities.

AB OBJECTIVES: To measure girls' and boys' exposure to alcohol advertising in magazines and to compare this exposure with that of legal-age persons.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: Alcohol advertisements (N = 6239) in 103 national magazines for which placement, audience, and cost data for 2001 and 2002 were available, categorized by year, beverage type, and brand. Placement and readership (age and sex) data generated estimates of media exposure for the age groups 12 to 20, 21 to 34, and 21 years and older.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gross rating points, an advertising industry standard measure of the level of media exposure of a given population, and gross rating point ratios comparing exposure of different demographic groups.; RESULTS: Alcohol companies spent 590.4 million US dollars to place 471 beer and ale advertisements (8%), 4748 distilled spir-its advertisements (76%), 116 low-alcohol refresher advertisements (2%), and 904 advertisements for wine (14%) in magazines in 2001 and 2002. In 2002, underage youth saw 45% more beer and ale advertising, 12% more distilled spirits advertising, 65% more low-alcohol refresher advertising, and 69% less advertising for wine than persons 21 years and older. Girls aged 12 to 20 years were more likely to be exposed to beer, ale, and low-alcohol refresher advertising than women in the group aged 21 to 34 or women in the group aged 21 years and older. Girls' exposure to low-alcohol refresher advertising increased by 216% from 2001 to 2002, while boys' exposure increased 46%.; CONCLUSION: Exposure of underage girls to alcohol advertising is substantial and increasing, pointing to the failure of industry self-regulation and the need for further action.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study tested a CD-ROM intervention with and without a parent involvement component to reduce risk of alcohol use among an urban sample of early adolescents.; METHOD: Youths (N = 514, mean age 11.5 years at recruitment) were assigned randomly by community site to receive the CD-ROM intervention, the CD-ROM plus parent intervention, or no intervention. All youths completed pretest, posttest and three annual follow-up measurements. After pretesting, youths and parents received their respective interventions.; RESULTS: Main effects of the intervention and for measurement occasion as well as interaction effects of the intervention by measurement occasion were seen for substance use and related outcomes. Over time, youths in all 3 groups reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana; youths who received the interventions reported smaller increases than control youths. At 3-year follow-up, alcohol use was lower for CD-ROM plus parent intervention youths than for CD-ROM only youths, who, in turn, reported less use than controls. Cigarette use was lower for youths in either intervention group than in the control group at posttest and at 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-ups. Marijuana use was lower for youths in either intervention than for controls at 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-ups. Youths in both intervention groups outperformed control youths at posttest and at 1- and 3-year follow-ups on levels of negative and peer influence toward substance use. Finally, at the 3-year follow-up, youths in the CD-ROM plus parent intervention group reported more family involvement in their alcohol use prevention efforts than did youths in the CD-ROM group, who, in turn, reported more positive levels of family involvement than youths in the control group.; CONCLUSIONS: Study findings modestly support the CD-ROM intervention with and without the parent intervention to reduce alcohol use risks among urban early adolescents.
