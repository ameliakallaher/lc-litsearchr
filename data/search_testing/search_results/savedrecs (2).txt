AB The current environmental experience of young children includes few opportunities for physical activity and an overabundance of high calorie foods. Sedentary lifestyles and poor nutrition challenge children who are predisposed to metabolic disorders. Obesity is a logical response to this challenge. To prevent clinically significant obesity and later metabolic disease in predisposed youth, all sectors of society must work together to support strategies to change public opinion and behavior across the life span. Parental education in all medical settings is strongly recommended, especially if the parent(s) are obese, beginning with the first pregnancy visit to the physician. Schools should be primary targets for efforts to educate parents concerning the reduction of TV, computer games, and unhealthy snacks. Schools should be encouraged to adopt vending machine policies that promote healthy drinks and food in appropriate portion sizes and discouraged from providing unhealthy food as rewards for positive behavior or academic accomplishment. Schools should provide daily physical education and frequent periods of unstructured play in young children. Clinical treatment should be both encouraged and financially supported in children who are already overweight. Community wide efforts to increase awareness and promote environments that encourage physical activity and healthy nutrition are needed.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe the life cycle of crime guns recovered from young people-the movement of those guns from manufacture to criminal use-and identify associations between the characteristics of those guns and their possessors, purchasers, sellers, and places of origin.; METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of data from gun ownership tracing records compiled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for 2,121 crime guns recovered in California from persons younger than 25 years and traced in 1999. Purchaser and seller data for handguns were updated when possible by linking to California handgun sales records.; RESULTS: The 2,121 traced guns were recovered from 1,717 young people. Guns recovered from persons aged 21 to 24 years were most frequently also purchased by persons aged 21 to 24 years; those recovered from persons younger than 18 years were most often purchased by persons aged 45 years or older. Small-caliber handguns made up 41.0% of handguns recovered from persons younger than 18 years but 25.2% of handguns recovered from persons aged 21 to 24 years. The median time from sale to recovery (commonly called time to crime) for all guns was 6.4 years (interquartile range 2.7 to 12.4 years). A time to crime of less than 3 years, suggesting deliberate gun trafficking, was observed for 17.3% of guns recovered from persons younger than 18 years but 34.6% of guns recovered from persons aged 21 to 24 years. Ten retailers who sold 10 or more traced guns accounted for 13.1% of all guns traced to a retailer. Handguns whose purchaser and possessor were the same person were more likely than others to be large-caliber semiautomatic pistols (29.3% and 11.7%, respectively); their median time to crime was 0.2 years (69 days).; CONCLUSION: Analysis of crime-gun ownership traces reveals patterns that may help refine gun violence prevention efforts and render them more effective.

AB Emerging findings from developmentally focused research indicates subtle but important neurocognitive disadvantages among adolescents with alcohol-use disorders (AUD) as compared to teens without AUD. Even after 3 weeks of abstinence AUD youth display a 10% decrement in delayed memory functions. Neuropsychological testing of youth followed at 4 and 8 years demonstrates that heavy drinking during adolescence is associated with diminished retrieval of verbal and nonverbal material, and poorer performance on tests requiring attention skills. Alcohol withdrawal over the teen years appears to uniquely contribute to deterioration in functioning in visuospatial tasks. Brain imaging studies suggest reduced hippocampal volumes, white matter microstructure irregularities, brain response abnormalities while performing challenging cognitive tasks, and enhanced brain response when viewing alcohol cues (i.e., alcohol advertisements) among adolescents with AUD. Family characteristics such as history of alcoholism and socioeconomic status as well as personal features, including adolescent psychopathology, gender, and age of onset must be carefully considered when investigating the influence of teenage drinking on neurocognition. Further research is needed to understand how age at onset of drinking and duration of abstinence at the time of assessment affect cognitive findings. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify neuromaturational changes associated with early alcohol exposure and patterns of resiliency. Although the magnitude of alcohol-related effects observed in adolescents' neurocognition is relatively modest, the implications are major given the prevalence of alcohol involvement, and the important educational, occupational, and social transitions that occur during adolescence.

AB Youth substance use is an important social and health problem in the United States, Australia and other Western nations. Schools are recognized as important sites for prevention efforts and school substance use policies are a key component of health promotion in schools. The first part of this paper reviews the known status of school policies on tobacco, alcohol and other illicit drugs in a number of Western countries and the existing evidence for the effectiveness of school drug policy in preventing drug use. The review shows that most schools in developed countries have substance use policies but that there is substantial variation in the comprehensiveness of these policies (i.e. the breadth of people, places and times of day that are explicitly subject to policy prohibitions), and the orientation of their enforcement (e.g. punitive versus remedial), both across and within schools. The few studies of policy impact focus solely on tobacco policy and provide preliminary evidence that more comprehensive and strictly enforced school policies are associated with less smoking. The second part of the paper introduces the International Youth Development Study, a new longitudinal research project aimed at comparing school policies and the developmental course of youth drug use in the United States, where drug policies are abstinence-based, with Australia, which has adopted a harm minimization approach to drug policy.

AB OBJECTIVE: This investigation tested whether the timing of puberty continued to be associated with experiences of psychopathology (symptoms and disorders) from mid-adolescence into young adulthood.; METHOD: At age 24, 931 participants from a large community sample, who had been interviewed twice during adolescence, completed a telephone interview (assessing Axis I disorders and elevated antisocial and borderline personality traits) and a mailed questionnaire battery.; RESULTS: Analyses tested whether pubertal timing was associated with lifetime and current history of mental disorders and psychosocial functioning in young adulthood. As expected, young women who had been early maturers had higher rates of lifetime history of disorder along with current elevation of psychosocial symptoms compared with women who were on-time maturers. Young men who had been late maturers, compared with other men, had elevated onset of disruptive behavior and substance use disorders during the transition to adulthood.; CONCLUSIONS: Early maturing females are at unique risk of persistent difficulty during adolescence and should be targeted for preventive efforts. Late maturation among males may be associated with a late-onset pathway for deviant behavior or substance abuse.

AB This study assessed whether behavioral differences explained higher human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among injection drug users (IDUs) in three East Coast versus two West Coast cities in the United States. Sociodemographic, sexual, and injecting information were collected during semiannual face-to-face interviews. Baseline data from New York City; Baltimore, Maryland; and New Haven, Connecticut, were compared with data from Los Angeles, California, and San Jose, California. Among 1,528 East Coast and 1,149 West Coast participants, HIV sero-prevalence was 21.5% and 2.3%, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.9-17.8). HIV risk behaviors were common among IDUs on both coasts, and several were more common among West Coast participants. Adjusting for potential risk factors, East (vs. West) Coast of residence remained highly associated with HIV status (adjusted OR 12.14; 95% CI 7.36-20.00). Differences in HIV sero-prevalence between East and West Coast cities did not reflect self-reported injection or sexual risk behavior differences. This suggests that other factors must be considered, such as the probability of having HIV-infected injection or sexual partners. Prevention efforts are needed on the West Coast to decrease HIV-associated risk behaviors among IDUs, and further efforts are also needed to reduce HIV incidence on the East Coast.

The current prevalence of smoking was 10.6% among men and 0.0% among women. The current prevalence of alcohol use was 21.2% among men and 3.3% among women. A significantly higher proportion of men than women expressed favorable attitudes toward the alcohol industry (27% versus 7%) and the tobacco industry (13% versus 5%). Given that aggressive marketing strategies are used by these industries to promote their products among young people, epidemiological studies of the substances using scientifically sound methods to formulate effective prevention strategies are essential.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occurrence and school-level clustering of drug involvement among school-attending adolescent youths in each of seven countries in Latin America, drawing upon evidence from the PACARDO research project, a multinational collaborative epidemiological research study.; METHODS: During 1999-2000, anonymous self-administered questionnaires on drug involvement and related behaviors were administered to a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample that included a total of 12,797 students in the following seven countries: Costa Rica (n = 1,702), the Dominican Republic (n = 2,023), El Salvador (n = 1,628), Guatemala (n = 2,530), Honduras (n = 1,752), Nicaragua (n = , 419), and Panama (n = 1,743). (The PACARDO name concatenates PA for Panama, CA for Centroamerica, and RDO for Republica Dominicana). Estimates for exposure opportunity and actual use of alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, marijuana, cocaine (crack/coca paste), amphetamines and methamphetamines, tranquilizers, ecstasy, and heroin were assessed via responses about questions on age of first chance to try each drug, and first use. Logistic regression models accounting for the complex survey design were used to estimate the associations of interest.; RESULTS: Cumulative occurrence estimates for alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, marijuana, and illegal drug use for the overall sample were, respectively: 52%, 29%, 5%, 4%, and 5%. In comparison to females, males were more likely to use alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, marijuana, and illegal drugs; the odds ratio estimates were 1.3, 2.1, 1.6, 4.1, and 3.2, respectively. School-level clustering was noted in all countries for alcohol and tobacco use; it was also noted in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panama for illegal drug use.; CONCLUSIONS: This report sheds new light on adolescent drug experiences in Panama, the five Spanish-heritage countries of Central America, and the Dominican Republic, and presents the first estimates of school-level clustering of youthful drug involvement in these seven countries. Placed in relation to school survey findings from North America and Europe, these estimates indicate lower levels of drug involvement in these seven countries of the Americas. For example, in the United States of America 70% of surveyed youths had tried alcohol and 59% had smoked tobacco. By comparison, in these seven countries, only 51% have tried alcohol and only 29% have smoked tobacco. Future research will help to clarify explanations for the observed variations across different countries of the world. In the meantime, strengthening of school-based and other prevention efforts in the seven-country PACARDO area may help these countries slow the spread of youthful drug involvement, reduce school-level clustering, and avoid the periodic epidemics of illegal drug use that have been experienced in North America.

AB BACKGROUND: Young people are of particular importance in state policies against Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). We intended to assess the knowledge and attitude of high school students regarding AIDS in Iran.; METHODS: Through a cluster-sampling, 4641 students from 52 high schools in Tehran were assessed by anonymous questionnaires in February 2002.; RESULTS: The students identified television as their most important source of information about AIDS. Only a few students answered all the knowledge questions correctly, and there were many misconceptions about the routes of transmission. Mosquito bites (33%), public swimming pools (21%), and public toilets (20%) were incorrectly identified as routes of transmission. 46% believed that Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive (HIV positive) students should not attend ordinary schools. Most of the students wanted to know more about AIDS. In this study knowledge level was associated with students' attitudes and discipline (p < 0.001).; CONCLUSION: Although the knowledge level seems to be moderately high, misconceptions about the routes of transmission were common. There was a substantial intolerant attitude towards AIDS and HIV positive patients. We recommend that strategies for AIDS risk reduction in adolescents be developed in Iranian high schools.

AB BACKGROUND: Early studies assessing propensity of alcohol sales to underage youth found that, before intervention, likelihood of licensed alcohol establishments selling alcohol to underage youth was 50% or higher across many communities. Community-wide interventions successfully lowered underage alcohol sales rates in several communities. Across studies assessing propensity for alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons, sales rate estimates ranged from 58% to 85% for on-premise establishments (e.g., bars). No previous studies have assessed likelihood of alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons in off-premise establishments (e.g., liquor stores). One goal of this study was to assess propensity for illegal alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons at on- and off-premise establishments. Another goal was to assess whether server and/or establishment characteristics were related to the likelihood of illegal sales. Results may inform future interventions to reduce illegal alcohol sales at licensed alcohol establishments.; METHODS: Trained actors attempted to purchase alcohol while acting out signs of obvious intoxication at a census of on- and off-premise alcohol establishments (n = 372) in 11 communities. The outcome variable was whether an establishment sold alcohol to a buyer. Independent variables included age and gender of server/clerk, type of establishment, area, exterior maintenance, type of license, and time of purchase attempt. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.; RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the establishments sold alcohol to a buyer (83% and 76% at off- and on-premise establishments, respectively). Servers/clerks who appeared younger than age 31 and off-premise establishments were significantly more likely than older appearing servers and on-premise establishments to sell alcohol to buyers.; CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons in licensed alcohol establishments is very high. Interventions to reduce illegal alcohol sales to intoxicated patrons are needed.

AB Although research indicates that school meal programs contribute to improved academic performance and healthier eating behaviors for students who participate, fewer than 60% of students choose the National School Lunch Program or School Breakfast Program. School meal programs have a difficult time competing with foods that are marketed to young people through sophisticated advertising campaigns. Youth's preferences for fast foods, soft drinks, and salty snacks; mixed messages sent by school personnel; school food preparation and serving space limitations; inadequate meal periods; and lack of education standards for school foodservice directors challenge school meal programs as well. A coordinated school health program offers a framework for meeting these challenges and provides children and adolescents with the knowledge and skills necessary for healthful eating. This article identifies challenges facing school foodservice directors in delivering healthful meals and acquaints dietetics professionals with the coordinated school health program to be used as a tool for addressing unhealthful weight gain and promoting healthful eating.

AB BACKGROUND: Heroin is a synthetic opioid with an extensive illicit market leading to large numbers of people becoming addicted. Heroin users often present to community treatment services requesting detoxification and in the UK various agents are used to control symptoms of withdrawal. Dissatisfaction with methadone detoxification 8 has lead to the use of clonidine, lofexidine, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine; however, there remains limited evaluative research. In Leeds, a city of 700,000 people in the North of England, dihydrocodeine is the detoxification agent of choice. Sublingual buprenorphine, however, is being introduced. The comparative value of these two drugs for helping people successfully and comfortably withdraw from heroin has never been compared in a randomised trial. Additionally, there is a paucity of research evaluating interventions among drug users in the primary care setting. This study seeks to address this by randomising drug users presenting in primary care to receive either dihydrocodeine or buprenorphine.; METHODS/DESIGN: The Leeds Evaluation of Efficacy of Detoxification Study (LEEDS) project is a pragmatic randomised trial which will compare the open use of buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for illicit opiate detoxification, in the UK primary care setting. The LEEDS project will involve consenting adults and will be run in specialist general practice surgeries throughout Leeds. The primary outcome will be the results of a urine opiate screening at the end of the detoxification regimen. Adverse effects and limited data to three and six months will be acquired.

AB BACKGROUND: Popular culture (movies, television shows, advertising) often portrays drinking to the point of intoxication as either humorous or associated with enjoyable social activities that enhance quality of life. This study examined the association between binge drinking (consuming five or more alcoholic drinks on one occasion) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among U.S. adults.; METHODS: Data are from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a continuous random-digit-dial telephone survey of adults aged >/=18 years conducted in all states. This survey included questions about alcohol consumption and HRQOL.; RESULTS: In 2001, 52% of U.S. adults were current drinkers (one or more drinks in the past 30 days). Of current drinkers, 11% were frequent binge drinkers (three or more episodes in past month) and 14% were infrequent binge drinkers (one to two episodes in past month). After adjusting for confounding factors, frequent binge drinkers were more likely than non-binge drinkers to experience >/=14 unhealthy days (physical or mental) in the past month (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.24-1.56), primarily because they had more mentally unhealthy days than non-binge drinkers (AOR=1.52, 95% CI=1.32-1.75).; CONCLUSIONS: Frequent binge drinking is associated with significantly worse HRQOL and mental distress, including stress, depression, and emotional problems. Effective interventions to prevent binge drinking should be widely adopted and may help improve quality of life.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although bloodstream infection commonly results in critical illness, population-based studies of the epidemiology of severe bloodstream infection are lacking. We sought to define the incidence and microbiology of severe bloodstream infection (bloodstream infection associated with intensive care unit admission within 48 hrs) and assess risk factors for acquisition and death.; DESIGN: Population-based surveillance cohort.; SETTING: Multidisciplinary and cardiovascular surgical intensive care units.; PATIENTS: All adults with severe bloodstream infection in the Calgary Health Region (population approximately 1 million) during 2000-2002.; INTERVENTIONS: None.; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred forty patients had 342 episodes of severe bloodstream infection (15.7 per 100,000 population/year). Several demographic and chronic conditions were significant risk factors for acquiring severe bloodstream infection (relative risk, 95% confidence interval) including age > or =65 yrs (7.0, 5.6-8.7), male gender (1.3, 1.1-1.6), urban residence (2.4, 1.2-5.6), hemodialysis (208.7, 142.9-296.3), diabetes mellitus (5.9, 4.4-7.8), alcoholism (5.6, 3.8-8.0), cancer (7.5, 5.3-10.3), and lung disease (3.8, 2.6-5.4). The most common etiologies were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.0, 3.0, and 1.9 per 100,000/year, respectively). The case-fatality rate was 142 of 340 (42%) for an annual mortality rate of 6.5 per 100,000. Increased Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.1 per point; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.2) and presence of a comorbidity (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.3) were significant independent predictors of death.; CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infections are commonly severe enough to require management in an intensive care unit and are associated with a high mortality rate. Identification of risk factors for severe bloodstream infection may allow targeting of preventive efforts to individuals at greatest potential benefit.

AB This paper provides a profile of clients seen by male sex workers (MSWs) in Cordoba, Argentina. Thirty-two MSWs completed a diary after each paid sexual encounter with a client over a two-week period. The results show that 254 commercial sex encounters were reported. More than half of these encounters were with first time clients. The most common source of recruiting clients was advertisements followed by street contact. The majority of the clients were aged in their 30s or 20s, and identified as 'middle class' and 'bisexual' or 'gay'. In the majority of the encounters, alcohol or drugs were not used by clients, and in about less than half of the cases, the MSWs had some personal tracing information about the client. Most of the clients indicated to the MSW what sexual activity they wanted and unsafe anal sex was requested in a minority (6%) of the encounters. While most workers reported having no or little attraction to the client, most indicated that they would serve the client again. The implications of the results for public health education and further research are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVES: To classify adolescents according to risky single occasion drinking (RSOD) and their level of social integration, and to test whether these groups (social non-RSODs, social RSODs, solitary non-RSODs, solitary RSODs) differ in terms of emotional well-being and violence-related variables.; METHOD: K-means cluster and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed based on a cross-sectional national representative sample of 3861 8th and 9th graders in Switzerland (mean age 15.3; SD = 0.88).; RESULTS: Although RSODs in general appear to be more violent, social RSODs tend to be more violent than solitary RSODs. Although RSODs reveal a lower life satisfaction generally and tend to have more depressive moods, solitary RSODs are even less satisfied and more depressive. In addition, the latter tend to have lower self-esteem and are more often victims of bullying.; CONCLUSIONS: RSODs are not a homogeneous group of adolescents and preventive efforts, such as competence-enhancing and social resistance programmes, should be applied in accordance with the constellation of associated problems: solitary RSODs appear to be socially inhibited, depressive and often victims of bullying, whereas social RSODs appear to be socially accepted but are prone to be violent offenders.

AB BACKGROUND: Public health policy guidelines recommend that health care providers (eg, physicians, nurses, others) counsel adolescent smokers to quit and that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may be considered to aid in smoking cessation for nicotine-dependent youth. This recommendation is discrepant with Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling of NRT products, stating that they not be sold to persons younger than 18 years. It is not clear how easily minors are able to purchase NRT products in retail markets.; OBJECTIVE: To explore youth access to NRT by conducting the first study, to our knowledge, to determine the ability of minors to purchase over-the-counter NRT products.; DESIGN: Observational case series of NRT purchase attempts and survey description of store characteristics.; SETTING: Retail businesses in Memphis, Tenn.; PARTICIPANTS: Population-based sample of 165 stores that sold over-the-counter medications.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Successfully completed purchase attempts of NRT by the minor buyer.; RESULTS: In most stores that stocked NRT products, the age of the minor was not queried at any time during the purchase attempt (79%) and the minor was able to successfully purchase the product (81%). If the minor was asked her age, the store was much less likely to sell the NRT product. Stores in which a cash register gave an age query prompt or in which alcohol was sold were more likely to inquire about the minor's age and less likely to sell NRT products.; CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine replacement therapy products were successfully obtained in most purchases by a minor buyer without proof of age. While ease of purchasing NRT products is potentially beneficial to young smokers attempting to quit, these purchases are discrepant with Food and Drug Administration labeling regarding the sale of NRT products to minors.

AB OBJECTIVES: To test whether high school students' participation in advocacy activities related to the advertising, availability, and use of tobacco in their communities would prevent or reduce their own tobacco use.; DESIGN: Ten continuation high schools in northern California, randomly assigned to a semester-long program in which students either carried out advocacy activities to counter environmental-level smoking influences in their communities (treatment) or learned about drug and alcohol abuse prevention (control).; PARTICIPANTS: Eleventh and 12th grade high school students; 5 (advocacy) treatment and 5 control schools over 4 semesters from 2000 through 2002.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported smoking defined as nonsmokers (those who had never smoked tobacco or those who were former smokers), light smokers (those who smoked <1 pack per week), or regular smokers (those who smoked >or=1 pack per week), and confirmed by carbon monoxide level readings. The following 3 constructs related to social cognitive theory- perceived incentive value, perceived self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies-were assessed.; RESULTS: There was a significant net change from baseline to the end of the semester (after the intervention) between treatment and control schools for students who were regular smokers, but not for students who were nonsmokers or light smokers. Regular smoking decreased 3.8% in treatment schools and increased 1.5% in control schools (P<.001). Regular smoking continued to decrease at 6 months after the intervention in treatment schools, with a total change in prevalence from 25.1% to 20.3%. Involvement in community-advocacy activities and the 3 social constructs-perceived incentive value, perceived self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies-also showed significant net changes between treatment and control schools (all P values <.01).; CONCLUSION: Student engagement in community-advocacy activities that addressed environmental influences of cigarette smoking resulted in significant decreases in regular smoking.

AB OBJECTIVE: The spirits market in Switzerland was reformed in 1999 in accordance with the World Trade Organization agreement. The resulting tax reform and increased competition have resulted in markedly reduced prices for foreign spirits, and a previous study showed that spirits consumption increased significantly after the tax reform. The present study examined whether alcohol-related problems also increased at follow-up and if they did, whether the increase was the result of increased spirits consumption. Further correlates of alcohol-related problems were also explored.; METHOD: Data were obtained from a longitudinal study on changes in alcohol consumption in Switzerland. The baseline survey was conducted 3 months before the tax reform, and the follow-up was conducted 28 months after the tax reform. A randomly selected sample of 4,007 residents aged 15 years or older participated in the baseline survey, and 73% of this sample participated in the follow-up survey. Alcohol consumption was measured on the basis of a graduated frequency, and alcohol-related problems were measured by items taken from the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT).; RESULTS: Findings indicate that alcohol-related problems increased significantly at follow-up. The significance disappeared, however, after controlling for spirits consumption, indicating that the increase of alcohol-related problems at follow-up was mainly mediated through increased consumption of spirits. The multiple regression models showed that spirits, beer and wine consumption, gender, Age*Spirits Consumption interaction, region, smoking status, heavy-drinking frequency and average number of drinks were significant correlates of alcohol-related problems.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-related problems increased at the follow-up, particularly among younger age groups who consumed more spirits. Prevention programs on alcohol-related problems should target young people.

AB PURPOSE: To determine the association between new sex partner acquisition and incident STDs, to describe predictors of acquiring a new sex partner, and to compare new and established sex partnerships among adolescent females.; METHODS: Interview data and biological specimens for STD testing were collected from a sample of 411 adolescent females (average age 17.3 years, 44% black and 42% Hispanic) enrolled in a longitudinal study. The relationship between having a new sex partner and incident STD infection was estimated with logistic regression.; RESULTS: Acquisition of a new sex partner during the 12-month follow-up period was common (24%) and significantly associated with an incident STD infection (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.6-5.7). Predictors of new partner acquisition were younger age, younger age at first intercourse, and alcohol or drug use before sex in past 30 days. Being in a new partnership was significantly associated with greater uncertainty about the partners' STD history and recent sex with others.; CONCLUSIONS: Being in a new sex partnership is an important predictor of incident STD infection. Awareness of this risk can help clinicians identify individuals who are more likely to get STDs and therefore target STD testing and appropriate prevention messages.

AB Alcohol consumption by youth can produce negative health outcomes. This study identified correlates of lifetime alcohol use, recent alcohol use, and binge drinking among youth in sixth through 10th grade (n = 2,004) in Sarasota County, Fla. Results from a closed-ended, quantitative survey acknowledged a range of personal, social, and environmental influences. Breadth of these influences supports a need for multifaceted, community-based interventions for effective prevention of youth alcohol use. This study was unique because it represents population-specific research in which community partners are using the findings to develop community-specific social marketing interventions to prevent underage drinking and promote alternative behaviors.

AB About one third of the economical costs, which are due to death, sickness and life quality deficits in higher developed industrial countries, are caused by pollutants such as nicotine, alcohol and false eating habits. Within a period of one year 183,000 people in Germany die on tobacco associated sickness effects, 73,000 on direct or indirect aftermath of alcohol usage and a proportional amount of mostly adipoptic people on the hereoff resulting sickness effects. These risk trias, decided by every person mainly for himself by his own behaviour or mis-behaviour, are even aggravated by the free enterprise sanctioned drug politics of the highly profitable mega markets of the tobacco-, alcohol- and fast-food-industry. Health orientated drug politic, which is based on independence and solidarity and an exhaustive primary prevention within the scope of early nationalization authorities can therefore only have a limited effect. Even though, standardized, therapeutic short interventions used by hazardous alcohol- and drug usage, the qualified detoxification on addiction illness and an way to little used meanwhile time- and cost optimized withdrawal treatment have been proven to be quite effective. Exhaustive established ambulant smoking-withdrawal treatment programs are of special importance, because with continuously sinking of first contact, nicotine is know to be the "gate way drug" with the strongest addiction potential among all legalized and non-legalized drugs. In canon of mean while worldwide (except for Germany) started drug-control politics one will be able to start a health orientated drug politic in the future, which is including especially the drug economic aspects for the benefit of all as well as for the national budgets.

AB Adolescents tend to overestimate peer drinking; the resulting misperception of the social norm predicts the child's own future drinking. This study examined the misperception's relatedness to a person's drinking pattern in order to facilitate the segmentation of the audience for health education interventions. Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Survey (Finland) data on 14 year olds' drinking patterns and perceptions of peer drinking were gathered using self-administered mailed questionnaires in 1989 (N = 3105, response rate 77%), 1995 (N = 8382, 79%) and 2001 (N = 7292, 70%). The perceptions of peer drinking were significantly related to respondents' drinking patterns. Non-drinkers and those drinking recurrently until drunkenness held reasonably correct views of their peers' drinking. However, the segment between these two extremes comprising around half of the cohort incorrectly thought that their peers drank more; they misperceived the normative drinking pattern to be drunkenness. From health education perspective, three different target audiences can be identified: non-drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers. The intermediate group, drinkers not normally getting drunk, holds the view most influenced by the social norm misperception and are likely to feel pressured to increase their drinking. The social norms marketing approach to health education should find this group the most viable target.

AB BACKGROUND: To determine the health needs non-nationals, information on disease occurrence is fundamental. GOALS The goal of this study was to assess the clinical and behavioral characteristics of non-Italians with a new sexually transmitted infection (STI).; METHODS: Data were taken from Italy's National STI Surveillance System (1991-1999).; RESULTS: Of the 61,798 STI cases reported from January 1991 to December 1999, 6847 (11.2%) were diagnosed among non-Italians, 47.1% of whom were Africans. Being a non-Italian patient with an STI was associated with male gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.27), youngest age (AOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.43-2.04), no formal education (AOR, 20.25; 95% CI, 17.51-23.42), and having contracted the STI abroad (AOR, 13.98; 95% CI, 12.59-15.54). The HIV-1 prevalence among non-Italian patients with STIs was 5.5% (95% CI, 4.9-6.2), with large differences by continent of origin. The highest prevalence was found among European injecting drug users (54.1%; 95% CI, 37.1-70.1), South American homosexual men (41.6%; 95% CI, 32.0-51.8), and heterosexuals from Sub-Saharan Africa (8.9%; 95% CI, 7.2-10.8).; CONCLUSIONS: Non-Italian patients with STIs seem to consist mainly of migrants, and STI transmission patterns differ from those among Italians; this information is important for developing targeted STI prevention efforts.

AB UNLABELLED: The new Brazilian Traffic Code considers drinking and driving as a traffic crime. A health behavior model suggests that much of the young people's risky behavior is not planned and that questions measuring the willingness to drink and drive are useful. In face of the importance of drinking and driving as a national health problem, the objective of the present study was to analyze the behavior willingness among youngsters about to receive their driver's licenses.; METHODS: The study was carried out at the Sao Paulo Department of Traffic (DETRAN-SP) in 1998. Data were obtained from a sample of 2,166 youths, 18 to 25 years old, who took the written drivers' license examination. Data about, among other things, alcohol consumption, willingness and alternatives to drinking and driving in the following year was examined.; RESULTS: In general, individuals displayed willingness to both the risky behavior (drunk driving) and to the safe behavior (alternatives as taking a cab or getting a ride). Regression analyzes were done by dividing the sample in three groups. Several significant differences were found between the groups, suggesting that the attitudes and behaviors went on a direction from safer to riskier from groups 1 to 3.; CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that prevention efforts presenting a spectrum of alternatives to drunk driving and the enforcement of drink and driving laws would be two useful addenda to the more severe laws created in the 1998 Traffic Code.

Regression analyses showed (1) none of the individual-difference variables (alcohol use, exposure to vicarious sources of alcohol information, such as televised advertising, and demographics) predicted self-generated responses, and (2) alcohol use and first-hand observation of others' drinking did predict the valence respondents assigned to the outcomes. Results support and extend the findings of Stacy, Galaif, Sussman, and Dent [Psychology of Addictive Behaviors 10(1) 1996 18], wherein self-generated drug use outcomes appeared to be available in memory regardless of previous drug use or other individual differences.

Alcohol advertising, the price of alcohol, and the degree to which underage drinking laws are enforced also play a role. It is difficult to establish the degree to which alcohol use is influenced by environmental factors.

AB Genetic and environmental influences on symptoms of adult antisocial behavior (AAB) and alcohol dependence at ages 17, 20, and 24 were examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally in 188 monozygotic and 101 dizygotic male twin pairs. A moderate genetic influence on both AAB and alcohol dependence was found at each age, with a substantial proportion of this influence common to the two disorders, suggesting they share susceptibility genes. Biometrical models showed that continuity effects accounted for most of the stable variance in symptoms of both AAB and alcohol dependence, indicating that genetic and environmental effects associated with each of these disorders were similar at each age. Significant cross-lag effects (effects of alcohol dependence contributing to variance in AAB and vice versa) were observed at ages 20 and 24 for both disorders. The largest and theoretically most interesting of these effects indicated that one sixth of the genetic influence on AAB at age 20 was due to genetic effects associated with alcohol dependence at age 17. Thus, alcohol dependence symptoms at age 17 in particular had an effect on antisocial behavior symptoms at age 20, suggesting that alcohol involvement in adolescence may ensnare otherwise desisting youth in persistent antisocial behavior.

It is suggested that marketing is a powerful mechanism for attracting young consumers. The alcohol industry is an innovative industry able to use a wide variety of marketing tools to achieve success in the market-place. It is important to recognise that the marketing activities of the industry are becoming increasingly transnational and that policy response has to be equally transnational. Copyright 2004 S.

Schools that focused on demand reduction were less likely to ban alcohol use. One in 3 schools received funding for these programs from governmental agencies, and 1 in 5 from the alcohol industry. Such schools were more likely to conduct targeted alcohol education and social norms programs and were less likely to restrict alcohol use on campus or at college events. Colleges may want to reconsider prevention initiatives that focus exclusively on demand or supply. They may also want to examine the extent to which funding is the driving force shaping the direction of their alcohol initiatives.

AB This study tests whether the impact of alcohol advertising exposure on intentions to drink and actual consumption is mediated by cognitive responses to advertising messages and positive expectancies about alcohol use. The model was tested using survey data of two important age cohorts, 15 to 20 years (n=608) and 21 to 29 years (n=612). The findings show that alcohol advertising was influential in shaping young people's attitudes and perceptions about alcohol advertising messages. The attitudes and perceptions predicted both positive expectancies and intentions to drink of those under the legal drinking age, but did not affect the young adults' expectancies and consumption. Positive expectancies were powerful predictors of intentions to drink and consumption for both groups. The effects of alcohol advertising on intentions to drink of those aged 15 to 20 years were mediated by cognitive responses to advertising messages and positive expectancies. The mediation effect was not evident among those between 21 and 29 years.

Demographic, significant other, substance use, and access related variables were examined as predictors of intake and treatment entry. Results were similar to other findings regarding variables associated with initiation of individual substance use treatment, and 29% of eligible callers entered treatment. Men whose partners did not use substances or who used in moderation were more likely to attend the intake session, and couples who received referrals were more likely to enter treatment than those who responded to a newspaper advertisement.

AB This study examined heroin initiation and route of administration among 16 female adolescents in the greater Baltimore Metropolitan area. Participants were more than twice as likely to be introduced to heroin by a male friend or boyfriend (IHM) than introduced to heroin by other means (IHO). The majority of IHM females were introduced by a male friend rather than a romantic partner. No relationship was found between path of initiation (IHM, IHO) and initial route of administration (inhalation, smoking, injecting) or history of injection (ever injected, never injected). The effect of opposite-gender peer influence in the initiation of female adolescent heroin use is discussed along with how the current findings may influence treatment and prevention efforts. A statistically significant relationship was found for initial route of administration and for history of injection. Ninety-four percent of participants reported initiation of heroin use by inhalation, while an alarming 75% of participants reported injecting heroin at some time during their history of use. Participants were no more likely to be introduced to injection by a boyfriend or male friend than by other means. The finding that the majority of females first try heroin through inhalation is consistent with an increased use of heroin by this method among young people in recent years. However, the majority of users in this study used heroin through injection at least once in their addict career, a route of administration associated with increased health and safety risks. Potential explanations for the progression from snorting to injection are presented as well as implications for the delivery of prevention and treatment services.

AB Theoretical approaches to alcohol and violence have emphasized three interrelated domains of influence: the situational context, aggression-facilitating characteristics of individuals, and the impact of alcohol consumption. We examined these three domains as predictors of experiencing violence in the barroom setting. Participants were recruited through one of two phone surveys or through newspaper advertisements and classified into one of three groups: Experienced Bar Violence (EBV), Observed Bar Violence (OBV), and No Bar Violence (NBV). They completed questionnaires assessing individual difference and alcohol use variables, and an interview that assessed characteristics of their usual bar. The results suggested that individual difference and alcohol variables distinguished men in the EBV group from men in the OBV and NBV groups. However, women in the EBV group were distinguished from women in the NBV group by the characteristics of their usual bar and by the alcohol variables, but were distinguished from the OBV group only in terms of individual difference variables. The implications of these findings with respect to the influence of alcohol on barroom violence are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: We conducted a sibling/twin/adoption study of substance initiation, use, and problem use, estimating the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on these phenotypes in adolescents.; METHODS: The participants were 345 monozygotic twin pairs, 337 dizygotic twin pairs, 306 biological sibling pairs, and 74 adoptive sibling pairs assessed by the Colorado Center for the Genetics and Treatment of Antisocial Drug Dependence, Denver and Boulder. The initiation, use, and problem use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs were assessed. Tetrachoric correlations were computed for each group, and univariate model-fitting analyses were conducted.; RESULTS: There were moderate to substantial genetic influences, with the exception of alcohol use and any drug use, and modest to moderate shared environmental influences on substance initiation, use, and problem use. For alcohol and any drug, heritability was higher and the magnitude of shared environmental influences was lower for problem use than for initiation or use. Environmental influences shared only by twin pairs had a significant effect on tobacco initiation, alcohol use, and any drug use. For tobacco use, tobacco problem use, and marijuana initiation, heritability was higher and the magnitude of shared environmental influences was lower in female than in male adolescents. There was no evidence for sex-specific genetic or shared environmental influences on any variable.; CONCLUSIONS: The moderate to substantial heritabilities found for adolescents in the present study are comparable to those found in twin studies of adult substance use and substance use disorders. The finding that problem use is more heritable than initiation and use is also consistent with the results of adult twin studies. The significance of environmental influences shared only by twin pairs on tobacco initiation, alcohol use, and any drug use suggests the influences of peers, accessibility of substances, and sibling interaction.

AB Our objective was to determine the level of HIV/AIDS knowledge of pregnant women in India. In a sub-sample of these women, we documented the extent to which they experienced adverse social and physical difficulties within their home. The study was performed at an urban antenatal hospital clinic in Maharastra, India. From April to September 2001, structured interviews were conducted on 707 randomly selected antenatal clinic patients related to HIV/AIDS knowledge. Of these, 283 were further interviewed to document any social or physical difficulties they experienced. Over 75% of women displayed knowledge of primary transmission routes. Nearly 70% of women demonstrated knowledge of maternal to child transmission, however, only 8% knew of any methods of prevention. TV and written material were more strongly related to knowledge than access to radio messages or conversations with individuals. Thirty per cent of the women experienced physical or mental abuse or their spouse's alcohol and/or drug problems. Women reporting such abuse were more than twice as likely to have adequate HIV/AIDS knowledge compared with women reporting no such abuse. We found no relationship between reported household abuse and educational level of woman, husband, occupation of either partner, language or religion. We found no relationship between HIV status and knowledge of HIV and no relationship between HIV status and risk of abuse in the household. However, the total number of HIV patients in our sample was very small.

AB BACKGROUND: The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was enacted in 1997 to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured low-income children from families who earned too much to be eligible for Medicaid.; OBJECTIVES: To develop a "baseline" portrait of SCHIP enrollees in 5 states (Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Indiana, and New York) by examining: 1) SCHIP enrollees' demographic characteristics and health care experiences before enrolling in SCHIP, particularly children with special health care needs (CSHCN), racial and ethnic minority children, and adolescents; 2) the quality of the care adolescents received before enrollment; and 3) the changes in enrollee characteristics as programs evolve and mature.; METHODS: Each of 5 projects from the Child Health Insurance Research Initiative (CHIRI) surveyed new SCHIP enrollees as identified by state enrollment data. CHIRI investigators developed the CHIRI common core (a set of survey items from validated instruments), which were largely incorporated into each survey. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to ascertain whether there were racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care and differences between CSHCN and those without. Current Population Survey data for New York State were used to identify secular trends in enrollee characteristics.; RESULTS: Most SCHIP enrollees (65% in Florida to 79% in New York) resided in families with incomes < or =150% of the federal poverty level. Almost half of SCHIP enrollees lived in single-parent households. A majority of SCHIP parents had not had education beyond high school, and in 2 states (Alabama and New York) approximately 25% had not completed high school. The vast majority of children lived in households with a working adult, and in a substantial proportion of households both parents worked. Children tended to be either insured for the entire 12 months or uninsured the entire 12 months before enrolling in SCHIP. Private insurance was the predominant form of insurance before enrollment in SCHIP in most states, but 23.3% to 51.2% of insured children had Medicaid as their most recent insurance. HEALTH CARE USE AND UNMET NEEDS BEFORE SCHIP: The vast majority of all SCHIP enrollees had a usual source of care (USC) during the year before SCHIP. The proportion of children who changed their USC after enrolling in SCHIP ranged from 29% to 41.3%. A large proportion of SCHIP enrollees used health services during the year before SCHIP, with some variability across states in the use of health care. Nevertheless, 32% to almost 50% of children reported unmet needs. CSHCN: The prevalence of CSHCN in SCHIP (between 17% and 25%) in the study states was higher than the prevalence of CSHCN reported in the general population in those states. In many respects, CSHCN were similar to children without special health care needs, but CSHCN had poorer health status, were more likely to have had unmet needs, and were more likely to use the emergency department, mental health care, specialty care, and acute care in the year before enrolling in SCHIP than children without special health care needs. RACE AND ETHNICITY: A substantial proportion of SCHIP enrollees were black non-Hispanic or Hispanic children (Alabama: 34% and <1%; Florida: 6% and 26%; Kansas: 12% and 15%; and New York: 31% and 45%, respectively). Minority children were poorer, in poorer health, and less likely to have had a USC or private insurance before enrolling in SCHIP. The prevalence and magnitude of the disparities varied among the states. QUALITY OF CARE FOR ADOLESCENTS: Seventy-three percent of adolescent SCHIP enrollees engaged in one or more risk behaviors (ie, feeling sad or blue; alcohol, tobacco, and drug use; having sexual intercourse; and not wearing seat belts). Although almost 70% of adolescents reported having had a preventive care visit the previous year, a majority of them did not receive counseling in each of 4 counseling areas. Controlling for other factors, having a private, confidential visit with the physician was associated with an increased liked likelihood (2-3 times more likely) that the adolescent received counseling for 3 of 4 counseling areas. TRENDS OVER TIME: New York SCHIP enrollees in 2001, compared with 1994 enrollees in New York's SCHIP-precursor child health insurance program, were more likely to be black or Hispanic, older, from New York City, and from families with lower education, income, and employment levels. A greater proportion of 2001 enrollees was uninsured for some time in the year before enrollment, was insured by Medicaid, and lacked a USC. Secular trends in the low-income population in the state did not seem to be responsible for these differences. Program modifications during this time period that may be related to the shift in enrollee characteristics include changes to benefits, outreach and marketing efforts, changes in the premium structure, and the advent of a single application form for multiple public programs.; CONCLUSIONS: SCHIP enrollees are a diverse group, and there was considerable variation among the 5 study states. Overall, SCHIP enrollees had substantial and wide-ranging health care needs despite high levels of prior contact with the health care system. A sizable minority of SCHIP enrollees has special health care needs. There is racial and ethnic diversity in the composition of enrollees as well, with racial and ethnic disparities present. The quality of care adolescents received before enrollment in SCHIP was suboptimal, with many reporting unmet health care needs and not receiving recommended counseling. The characteristics of SCHIP enrollees can be expected to change as SCHIP programs evolve and mature.; POLICY IMPLICATIONS: 1) Benefits should be structured to meet the needs of SCHIP enrollees, which are comparable to Medicaid enrollees' needs in many respects. 2) Provider networks will have to be broad if continuity of care is to be achieved. 3) Multiple outreach strategies should be used, including using providers to distribute information about SCHIP. 4) The quality of care delivered to vulnerable populations (eg, minority children, CSHCN, and adolescents) should be monitored. 5) States and health plans should actively promote quality health care with the goal of improving the care received by SCHIP enrollees before enrollment. 6) States will have to craft policies that fit their local context. 7) Collecting baseline information on SCHIP enrollees on a continuous basis is important, because enrollee characteristics and needs can change, and many vulnerable children are enrolling in SCHIP.

AB The proportion of adults involved in serious bicycle accidents has increased in the last two decades. The majority of the bicycle injury prevention efforts, however, are directed toward child riders. The authors performed a retrospective review of injury statistics from the Massachusetts Hospital Discharge Data Set, 1994-1999, the Massachusetts Emergency Department Injury Surveillance System, 1999, and the trauma registry of an Urban Level I Trauma Centre, 1993-2000. Massachusetts's state-wide injury data reveals a 30% increase in hospital charges between 1994 and 1999 for adults following bicycle falls and collisions with concomitant stability in the charges for children. In the years 1993-2000, 60% of patients requiring inpatient care at the Study Centre for Bicycle Related Injuries were over 16 years of age. Fifty-one percent of patients were without a helmet. Positive blood alcohol tests were present in 35 (16%) of the 222 patients. Forty-six (75%) of patients suffering closed head injury were not helmeted. Adult bicycle trauma is a significant health and financial problem in the urban state of Massachusetts. Bicycle education and legislation emphasising safe bicycling practice, the protective effects of helmets, and the danger of cycling under the influence of alcohol may help alleviate this problem.

AB OBJECTIVE: Studies on 3-, 7-, and 10-year-old twins' internalizing and externalizing problems have emphasized the importance of understanding sources of agreement and disagreement between maternal and paternal ratings. A psychometric model that assumes that each parent assesses rater-specific aspects of the child's behavior provided the best explanation for parental disagreement. This study investigates two models that have been used to explain the agreement and disagreement between mothers and fathers in the ratings of their children.; METHOD: Child Behavior Checklists filled in by mothers and fathers were collected for a sample of 1,481 twelve-year-old twin pairs. Genetic and environmental influences on internalizing and externalizing problems were estimated using models that corrected for rater bias, rater-specific effects, and unreliability.; RESULTS: The psychometric model fitted the data significantly better than a rater bias model. Significant influences of genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors were found for internalizing and externalizing behavior. Parent-specific views, rater bias, and unreliability were significant.; CONCLUSIONS: The best-fitting model implies that disagreement between parents is due to the fact that mothers and fathers provide information from their own perspective. This information should be seen as important and adding to the diagnostic formulation rather than as a point of disagreement. The finding that internalizing and externalizing problems are influenced by genetic and environmental factors fosters the understanding that it is the interaction of nature and nurture that puts children at risk for common behavioral disorders.

AB Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common cause of developmental disability, neuropsychiatric impairment and birth defects. The disorder is identified by the presence of growth impairment, central nervous system dysfunction, and a characteristic pattern of craniofacial features. The reported prevalence of the disorder varies widely and recent estimates approach 1% of live births. Expression of these features varies by age. People with FAS have high rates of comorbid conditions: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (40%), mental retardation (15-20%), learning disorders (25%), speech and language disorders (30%), sensory impairment (30%), cerebral palsy (4%), epilepsy (8-10%). Birth defects are common. In the United States, the annual birth cohort of persons with FAS could be as high as 39,000 cases annually. Cause-specific mortality is 6% for patients with FAS. The disorder is expensive to treat and most patients have lifelong impairment. The annual cost of care in the United States would approach US$5.0 billion. Early recognition and entry into appropriate treatment programs appear to improve outcome. Prevention efforts should involve screening for alcohol use prior to pregnancy and at the first prenatal care visit.

AB Between 1978 and 1997 the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Hannover Medical School examined 17 fatal autoerotic deaths. The incidence for the Hannover region was 0.49 cases per million inhabitants per year. The victims included 17 men with an average age of 36.8 years; a peak in the age distribution was seen between 20 and 29 years. Twelve of the men were found by friends or family in a domestic environment, while other situations in which the victims were found included the victim's own car, a hotel room, a canal embankment, a public parking lot as well as the holding cell of the youth detention center. The men were of varying socioeconomic status and held a number of different types of jobs or still attended school. Five of the men were found completely nude, while five were only undressed below the waist. Four men wore women's clothes and two were fully clothed with exposed genitals. Besides women's clothes, other objects found at the scene included various types of sexual aids, including ropes, chains, metal bars, locks, sex magazines, condoms, plastic bags, rubber items, etc. In four cases blood alcohol levels between 0.1 and 2.5 per thousand (urine alcohol levels between 0.2 and 2.5 per thousand ) were found. Toxicologic examination revealed chloroform, ketamine, a propane-butane gas mixture in one case each, and in two cases cocaine and morphine. Causes of death included central paralysis after strangulation (seven cases), asphyxiation (4), subarachnoid hemorrhage (2), intoxication (1), hypothermia (1), left heart failure (1), and drowning (1). The history, findings at scene, and autopsy findings and, in individual cases, other investigations are of utmost importance to accurately reconstruct a fatal autoerotic accident.

AB For the assessment of exposure to food-borne chemicals, the most commonly used methods in the European Union follow a deterministic approach based on conservative assumptions. Over the past few years, to get a more realistic view of exposure to food chemicals, risk managers are getting more interested in the probabilistic approach. Within the EU-funded 'Monte Carlo' project, a stochastic model of exposure to chemical substances from the diet and a computer software program were developed. The aim of this paper was to validate the model with respect to the intake of saccharin from table-top sweeteners and cyclamate from soft drinks by Italian teenagers with the use of the software and to evaluate the impact of the inclusion/exclusion of indicators on market share and brand loyalty through a sensitivity analysis. Data on food consumption and the concentration of sweeteners were collected. A food frequency questionnaire aimed at identifying females who were high consumers of sugar-free soft drinks and/or of table top sweeteners was filled in by 3982 teenagers living in the District of Rome. Moreover, 362 subjects participated in a detailed food survey by recording, at brand level, all foods and beverages ingested over 12 days. Producers were asked to provide the intense sweeteners' concentration of sugar-free products. Results showed that consumer behaviour with respect to brands has an impact on exposure assessments. Only probabilistic models that took into account indicators of market share and brand loyalty met the validation criteria.

AB The first case involving repetitive sexual abuse linked to the use of buprenorphine is reported. Under the tradename Subutex, buprenorphine is largely used for the substitution management of opiate-dependent individuals, but it can also be easily found on the black market. A 14-year-old boy was found dead at the home of a well-known sex offender of minors. At the autopsy, no particular morphological changes were noted, except for pulmonary and visceral congestion. There was no evidence of violence, and no needle marks were found by the pathologist. Toxicological analyses, as achieved by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, demonstrated both recent and repetitive buprenorphine exposure in combination with nordiazepam. Buprenorphine concentrations were 1.1 ng/mL and 23 pg/mg in blood and hair, respectively. The boy's death was attributed to accidental asphyxia in a facilitated repetitive sexual abuse situation due to the combination of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines, even at therapeutic concentrations. The use of buprenorphine as a sedative drug was not challenged by the perpetrator.

AB We test whether or not labor market frustration is associated with clinical alcohol abuse/dependence diagnoses among labor migrants living in California. Our sample consists of 1576 Mexican labor migrants in Fresno, CA, who migrated for the purpose of seeking employment. Using clinical criterion (DSM-III-R), we find that frustrating experiences resulting from labor market exclusion and discrimination are significantly related to past-year alcohol abuse/dependence. Similarly, although high levels of social support are salutary, they are not protective among those who experience moderate/high levels of employment frustration. Since Mexican-origin immigrants have low rates of health insurance coverage and lower propensities for formal help-seeking, community outreach programs that target labor migrants are essential to this population's mental health maintenance.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic characteristics of adolescent boys and girls who engage in three sedentary behaviors (television/video use, computer use, and reading/homework), and to explore how each sedentary activity is associated with body mass index (BMI), dietary behaviors, and leisure time physical activity.; DESIGN: This study draws on data collected from Project EAT (Eating Among Teens), a school-based survey examining personal, behavioral, and socioenvironmental factors that are associated with nutritional intake among adolescents.; SUBJECTS: The study sample consists of 4746 middle and high school students from 31 public schools in a metropolitan area of the upper Midwest. All students were invited to participate. The overall response rate for Project EAT was 81.5%. Data collection was completed during the 1998-1999 school year.; STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariate linear regression was used for examining associations between independent and dependent variables, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All differences were considered statistically significant at P<.05.; RESULTS: Among boys, television/video use and time spent reading/doing homework were positively associated with BMI (P<.05), whereas for girls television/video and computer use were positively associated with BMI (P<.05). High television/video use among boys and girls was associated with more unhealthful dietary behaviors (eg, increased consumption of soft drinks, fried foods, and snacks) (P<.05). In contrast, time spent reading/doing homework was associated with more healthful dietary behaviors (eg, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables) (P<.05). Leisure time physical activity was not associated with television/video use among boys or girls, but was positively associated with computer use and time spent reading/doing homework (P<.05). Applications/Conclusions Messages and advice aimed at reducing time spent in sedentary activities should be targeted at television/video use instead of time spent reading, doing homework, or using a computer. Nutrition education should incorporate messages about the influence of the media and advertising on dietary behaviors.

AB BACKGROUND: People at high risk for HIV infection could be increasing their risk behaviors, especially now that improved treatments for HIV infection are available.; GOAL: The goal was to investigate whether risk behaviors, perceptions of personal risk for HIV infection, and attitudes toward HIV testing among high-risk persons in Oregon differed in 1996 and 1998.; STUDY DESIGN: Data from the HIV Testing Survey (HITS), a cross-sectional survey administered to HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM), heterosexual adults at high-risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and intravenous drug users (IDUs) at high risk for HIV infection in 1996 (HITS-I), were compared with data from a similar group surveyed in 1998 (HITS-II).; RESULTS: Proportions of participants reporting specific risk behaviors remained relatively constant in 1996 and 1998. Personal risk of HIV infection was perceived as low by 54% of HITS-II participants and 61.2% of HITS-I participants (odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.7). IDUs in HITS-II were more likely than IDUs in HITS-I to perceive their risk as low (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7).; CONCLUSION: Persons at high risk might underestimate their risk for HIV infection while practicing risky behaviors. The prevalence of risk behaviors in these populations could be considered the baseline against which to measure future prevention efforts.

AB AIMS: To identify correlates of beer advertising awareness among adolescents at an age when most initiate use of alcohol.; DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of an in-school survey about alcohol advertising. Structural equation modeling was used to test for independent predictors of a latent beer advertising awareness construct, separately among boys and girls.; SETTING: Twenty middle schools in South Dakota, USA participated during their spring semester.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1530 eighth graders.; MEASUREMENTS: A latent advertisement awareness variable was derived based on recognition of six masked beer advertisements, knowledge of beer brands and knowledge of beer slogans. Tested predictors included measures of exposure to alcohol advertising in various venues, social norms regarding drinking, drinking beliefs and behavior and gender.; FINDINGS: Adolescents with greater exposure to advertisements in magazines, at sporting and music events and on television were more advertisement aware than those with less exposure, as were teens who watch more TV, pay attention to beer advertisements and know adults who drink. Beer advertisement awareness was dramatically higher among boys, and was associated with drinking only among boys.; CONCLUSIONS: Each of a variety of advertising venues appears to influence independently the extent to which beer advertising is incorporated into an adolescent's cognitive world. Boys are more likely to be aware of and remember beer marketing, and may be more likely to drink as a result of this awareness than girls.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of obesity among sixth- and seventh-grade students in a school-based setting, and to identify lifestyle parameters associated with obesity.; METHODS: Sixth- and seventh-grade students (n = 385, 186 boys and 199 girls) from 3 schools participated in a school-based screening study, and 319 completed a short questionnaire. Height and weight were measured, and body fat as a percentage of body weight was obtained using a Tanita bioelectrical impedance scale.; RESULTS: Overall, 35.3% of students had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) at or above the 85th percentile, and half these students (17.4%) had a BMI at or above the 95th percentile. Rates were higher among Latino and lower among Asian than non-Hispanic white students. Significant associations were found between BMI and hours of television watched per evening and daily soft drink consumption. The mean (SE) BMI z score for those watching less than 2 hours per night (0.34 [0.09]) was lower than for those watching 2 or more hours per night (0.82 [0.08]; P<.001). The mean (SE) BMI z score for those consuming less than 3 soft drinks per day (0.51 [0.07]) was lower than for those consuming 3 or more soft drinks per day (1.02 [0.13]; P =.003). Latino students watched more television (2.4 hours per night) than did non-Hispanic white or Asian students (1.3 hours per night; P<.001 for each) and consumed more soft drinks (1.6 per day) than non-Hispanic white students (1.1 per day; P =.004) or Asian students (0.7 per day; P<.001).; CONCLUSIONS: Time spent watching television and the number of soft drinks consumed were significantly associated with obesity. Latinos spent more time watching television and consumed more soft drinks than did non-Hispanic white or Asian students. These findings will be beneficial in developing preventive measures for these children.

AB BACKGROUND: Sugar rich drinks are a recognised risk factor in early childhood caries. Currently, in depth knowledge of factors influencing parents' choice of infant drinks is incomplete.; OBJECTIVES: This study investigated parents and carers understanding of feeding practices potentially detrimental to oral health; barriers to adopting safe feeding practices and commercial factors influencing feeding bottle and cup contents.; METHODOLOGY: A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was employed. Interviews were conducted by an experienced researcher and tape recorded. Following full transcription, emerging themes were identified, systematically explored and validated within the verbatim accounts. Thirty-three parents/carers of children aged three years and under, resident in areas of high caries prevalence in Cardiff, Wales, were interviewed.; RESULTS: Overall understanding of the prolonged effect of exposure to sugared drinks in feeding bottles and cups was poor. Greater concern was expressed over the use of bottles on the development of the occlusion. Milk was viewed as a food rather than as a drink. Many barriers to giving water were described: children reject it; mothers don't like it; it was 'cruel' to offer water instead of sweet drinks; water in feeding bottles or cups was seen as a sign of poverty. Commercial influences on choices were strong. Products offered by baby food manufacturers were viewed as safe, but a recently marketed "Toothsafe" drink was viewed with suspicion.; CONCLUSIONS: There are significant barriers to adopting the traditional oral health education message, that only milk and water are truly safe for teeth. Future oral health education and promotion programmes must recognise and account for these factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyse prevailing food patterns among Spanish children and young people and their relationship to sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey.; SETTING: Population study. Data were collected at participants' home addresses.; SUBJECTS: Random sample of the Spanish population aged 2-24 y (n=3534; 1629 boys and 1905 girls).; INTERVENTIONS: Food consumption was assessed by means of a 24-h recall and a food frequency questionnaire. Sociodemographic and lifestyle related data were collected by specially designed questionnaires, previously pretested and validated. All the information was collected during a personal interview by trained dietitians.; DATA COLLECTION: May 1998-April 2000.; RESULTS: Average consumption of fruit and vegetables was low. The youngest age group (2-5 y) showed the lowest proportions of inadequacy for the dairy group (P<0,001; chi(2)=39.11 boys; chi(2)=49.60 girls). Factor analysis identified five main components of dietary patterns. The 'Snacky' pattern was characterised by more frequent and higher consumption of bakery products (buns, cakes and biscuits), sweets, salted snacks and soft drinks. Higher intakes of fruit, vegetables and fish were associated to the 'Healthy' pattern. Children whose mother had a low level of education and those who spent more than 2 h daily watching TV were more likely to follow the 'Snacky' pattern. Girls were more likely to follow the 'Healthy' pattern, while children and young people whose mother had a lower level of education were less likely.; CONCLUSION: Results from this study highlight the importance of enhancing school-based and community-based actions to promote healthy eating and physical activity addressed to children and young people.

A random-digit-dial telephone survey of parents or guardians of children ages 10-17 years was conducted after a four-week advertising flight. Respondents with unassisted recall of the commercial more often disagreed that parent-child discussion is useful only if children have begun to experiment with alcohol, and more often reported having three or more parent-child discussions about alcohol compared to those who did not recall the commercial. Findings suggest the potential benefit of paid media campaigns to encourage parents to talk with their children about alcohol.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examines how communities, neighborhoods and stores influence retail pricing and promotion of beer.; METHOD: In the year 2000, trained field staff conducted observations in 2,024 retail alcohol stores in 160 communities throughout the contiguous United States. Based on a nationally representative sample of schools, we selected communities defined by the school's catchment area, or the vicinity from which the majority of students are drawn. We randomly selected off-sale alcohol retail establishments from a complete list of stores likely to sell tobacco or alcohol in the selected communities. Beer price and promotions are based on observations of Miller and Budweiser beer brands in the stores. Neighborhoods are defined by the store's census block. We used cross-sectional, hierarchical regression models and mixed methods procedures to analyze data.; RESULTS: Community, neighborhood and store characteristics were related to beer price; however, only community and store characteristics were predictive of beer promotions.; CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the pricing and promotion of beer vary systematically by some characteristics of communities, neighborhoods and stores, but not significantly by the number of young people populating a neighborhood. In addition, pricing and promotion of Budweiser and Miller beers, in particular, do not appear to target racial minority populations. Because of the significant effect of store characteristics, public health agencies and advocates might focus prevention efforts on collaborations with liquor control agencies to reduce variations in pricing and promotion of beer, which ultimately encourage risky drinking behaviors. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of pricing and promotion on alcohol-related social problems.

AB UNLABELLED: Drug abuse has crossed geographic, economic and social borders, and it remains one of the major problems facing our society today. The prevalence of recreational drug abuse among young adults (including women) has increased markedly over the past two decades. Nearly 90% of drug abusing women are of childbearing age. Consequently, it is not surprising to find pregnant women with a history of drug addiction. Obstetricians and obstetric anesthesiologists become involved in the care of drug abusing patients either in emergency situations, such as placental abruption, uterine rupture or fetal distress, or in more controlled situations, such as request for labor analgesia. The diverse clinical manifestations of maternal substance abuse may result in life-threatening complications and significantly impact the peripartum care of these patients.; TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians.; LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader will be able to list the most commonly abused substances during pregnancy, to describe the various effects of particular substances on pregnancy including the mechanism of desired effect for various substances, and to outline the obstetric anesthesia recommendations for the various substances abused during pregnancy.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examines situations in which drownings occur (environmental risk factors) and the victims' personal risk factors (age, gender, use of personal flotation device, medical condition, alcohol or drug use) to provide guidance for future drowning prevention efforts.; METHODS: The authors investigated 883 non-bathtub drownings among New York State residents for the years 1988 to 1994 using medical examiner, coroner, police, and/or hospital records in addition to death certificate data.; RESULTS: Males, children ages 0-4 years, and African American males ages 5-14 years residing in New York State outside New York City experienced the highest rates of drowning. The majority of drownings occurred in a natural body of water for all age groups, with the exception of children ages 0-4 years. Most drownings among children ages 0-4 years occurred in residential swimming pools. The child usually gained access to the pool via inadequate fencing, an open or ineffective gate, or a ladder (to an above-ground pool) left in the "down" position. Less than 10% of victims of watercraft-related drownings were wearing personal flotation devices. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) tests were positive for 44% of 250 persons 15 years of age and older for whom valid toxicology results were provided; 30% had BACs of 100 mg/dl or more.; CONCLUSIONS: Suggested prevention efforts include stricter enforcement of fencing requirements for residential swimming pools and drowning prevention education stressing personal flotation device use while boating and the danger of mixing alcohol and water-related activities.

AB Because "substance abuse" is a "family disease" of lifestyle, including both genetic and family environmental causes, effective family strengthening prevention programs should be included in all comprehensive substance abuse prevention activities. This article presents reviews of causal models of substance use and evidence-based practices. National searches by the authors suggest that there is sufficient research evidence to support broad dissemination of five highly effective family strengthening approaches (e.g., behavioral parent training, family skills training, in-home family support, brief family therapy, and family education). Additionally, family approaches have average effect sizes two to nine time larger than child-only prevention approaches. Comprehensive prevention programs combining both approaches produced much larger effect sizes. The Strengthening Families Program (SFP) is the only one of these programs that has been replicated with positive results by independent researchers with different cultural groups and with different ages of children. Few research-based programs have been adopted by practitioners, partly because of technology transfer issues. Overall, research on ways to improve dissemination, marketing, training, and funding is needed to improve adoption of effective prevention programs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Comprehensive tobacco control policies for US colleges and universities have been proposed by several groups in order to counter the rising use of tobacco by students enrolled in these institutions. Student opinion of these policies is not known, and concern about student opposition is one barrier that deters administrators from adopting the policies. This study measured student support for recommended college tobacco control policies.; DESIGN: Mailed survey of US college students (2001 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study).; SETTING: 119 nationally representative, four-year colleges and universities in the USA.; PARTICIPANTS: 10,904 randomly selected undergraduate students enrolled at participating schools.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Students' opinion of 7 proposed tobacco control policies.; RESULTS: A majority of students supported each policy. Over three quarters of students favoured smoke-free policies for all college buildings, residences, and dining areas, while 71% supported prohibiting tobacco advertising and sponsorship of campus social events, 59% favoured prohibiting tobacco sales on campus, and 51% supported smoke-free campus bars. All policies had more support among non-smokers than smokers (p < 0.001). Among smokers, support for policies was inversely related to intention to quit and intensity of tobacco consumption. Because college students' tobacco consumption is low, a majority of smokers favoured banning smoking in college buildings and dining areas and prohibiting tobacco marketing on campus.; CONCLUSIONS: Student support for proposed campus tobacco control policies is strong, even among smokers, and broadly based across demographic subgroups. These findings should provide reassurance to college administrators who are considering adopting these policies.

AB BACKGROUND: Abrupt changes in the alcohol consumption level and the suicide rate associated with the anti-alcohol campaign of 1985-1991 and the market reforms of 1992.; METHODS: Epidemiological investigation of total Russian suicide rate and per capita alcohol consumption utilizing the Box-Jenkins technique and regression analysis.; RESULTS: The decrease of per capita consumption from 14.2 to 10.5 l in 1985-1987 and the growth of this index after 1987 (14.6 l in 1994) saw a respective decline and increase of suicides per litre of alcohol: eight males and one female per 100,000 of the corresponding population (13 or 6% of male or female suicides and 12% total suicides). The maximum suicide rate was reached in 1994 (41.8 per 100,000 population, in 1981-1994 r=0.91). In 1984-1986 and 1991-1994 the distribution of suicides' age was close to that of the age distribution from fatal alcohol poisoning. Changes in the level of BAC-positive suicides are closely correlated with changes in the alcohol consumption level (r=0.98), whereas changes in the number of BAC-negative suicides were not related to changes in consumption.; CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption level plays a considerable role in the suicide rate, especially for male suicides. The rate of alcohol-related suicides is very high in Russia, owing to the very high alcohol consumption rate in the country.

AB The present study examined the prevalence rates and common predictors of substance use, aggression, and delinquency among inner-city minority youth entering middle school. A survey was administered to sixth grade students (N=5442) from 42 New York City schools. Aggressive behaviors were reported most frequently, followed by delinquent behaviors, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking. Across all behavioral outcomes, social and environmental influences explained the largest proportion of variance, followed by individual characteristics and skills, bonding to conventional institutions, and demographic variables. For the majority of predictor variables, there was substantial overlap in patterns of prediction across outcomes. These findings indicate that several factors that correspond to the predominant psychosocial theories of adolescent development explain variation across different problem behavior outcomes among inner-city minority youth.

Latinos, African Americans, and Asian Americans were oversampled to allow cross-group comparisons.; RESULTS: Rates of DD were lower for females than for males and were also lower for African Americans and Asian Americans than for whites. However, after we controlled for drinking patterns and driving practices, the results showed Latinos at greater risk for DD than white adolescents. Compared with whites and males, Asian American and female adolescents were less likely to report RWDD. When drinking patterns and driving practices were taken into account, Latino adolescents were nearly twice as more likely to ride with drinking drivers than whites.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a greater need for directing prevention efforts to target Latino youth and youth at risk. Moreover, research aimed at elucidating the social and environmental factors involved in the low prevalence rates of DD and RWDD among Asian American youth may indicate possible protective factors to DD and RWDD operating within the Asian American community.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: Alcohol, the most commonly used substance among adolescents, is frequently associated with injury. Effective interventions to prevent adolescent alcohol use and misuse in acute care settings are lacking. A laptop-based alcohol prevention program could reinforce other prevention efforts that adolescents may receive. We determined the feasibility of using an interactive laptop program with adolescent emergency department (ED) patients to prevent alcohol use and misuse.; METHODS: We used the recruitment phase of a randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center and an urban teaching hospital. Patients were aged 14 to 18 years and presented within 24 hours of an acute injury. Measures included patient recruitment, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, alcohol use characteristics, and patients' opinion of the computer program.; RESULTS: Of 843 eligible patients, 671 (79.6%) were enrolled and 655 (77.7%) completed the program. Parent or guardian reluctance was the most frequent reason for refusal. The participants averaged 16.0 years of age (range 14 to 18 years; SD 1.5 years), 66.9% were male, and 68.3% were white. Approximately 71% reported "ever" drinking. Recent alcohol use (past 3 months) by those "ever" drinking was as follows: 62.3% drank, 31.2% got drunk, and 37.4% binge drank. Seventy-four percent of recent drinkers reported that the program made them rethink their alcohol use. Ninety-four percent of participants liked the program. Only 5.3% required assistance with the program.; CONCLUSION: Use of an interactive computer program in the ED appears feasible. Further work is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in reducing alcohol-related behaviors among adolescents.

AB OBJECTIVE: Availability of confectionery from vending machines in secondary schools provides a convenient point of purchase. There is concern that this may lead to 'over-indulgence' and hence an increase in susceptibility to obesity and poor 'dietary quality'. The study objective was to investigate the association between the frequency of consumption of confectionery purchased from vending machines and other sources and related lifestyle factors in adolescent boys and girls.; DESIGN: A secondary school-based, cross-sectional study.; SUBJECTS AND SETTING: A total of 504 subjects were investigated (age range 12-15 years), from three schools in southern and northern England. Using a lifestyle questionnaire, frequency of confectionery consumption (CC) from all sources (AS) and vending machines (VM) was recorded for a typical school week. Subjects were categorised into non-consumers, low, medium and high consumers using the following criteria: none, 0 times per week; low, 1-5 times per week; medium, 6-9 times per week; high, 10 times per week or greater.; RESULTS: No differences were found in the frequency of CC from AS or VM between those who consumed breakfast and lunch and those who did not. No differences were found in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake in high VM CC vs. none VM CC groups, or in any of the VM CC groups. Confectionery consumption from AS (but not VM) was found to be higher in subjects who were physically active on the journey to school (P<0.01) but also higher in those who spent more time watching television and playing computer games (P<0.01). No associations were found between smoking habits or alcohol consumption and frequency of CC.; CONCLUSIONS: These results do not show a link between consumption of confectionery purchased from vending machines and 'poor' dietary practice or 'undesirable' lifestyle habits. Findings for total confectionery consumption showed some interesting trends, but the results were not consistent, either for a negative or positive effect.

AB Reducing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States requires new strategies, including emphasis on prevention of transmission by HIV-infected persons. Through ongoing attention to prevention, risky sexual and needle-sharing behaviors among persons with HIV infection can be reduced and transmission of HIV infection prevented. Medical care providers can substantially affect HIV transmission by screening their HIV-infected patients for risk behaviors; communicating prevention messages; discussing sexual and drug-use behavior; positively reinforcing changes to safer behavior; referring patients for services such as substance abuse treatment; facilitating partner notification, counseling, and testing; and identifying and treating other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). To help incorporate HIV prevention into the medical care of HIV-infected persons, CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America developed these recommendations. The recommendations are general and apply to incorporating HIV prevention into the medical care of all HIV-infected adolescents and adults, regardless of age, sex, or race/ethnicity. They are intended for all persons who provide medical care to HIV-infected persons (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants); they might also be useful to those who deliver prevention messages (e.g., case managers, social workers, health educators). The recommendations were developed by using an evidence-based approach. For each recommendation, the strength of the recommendation, the quality of available evidence supporting the recommendation, and the outcome for which the recommendation is rated are provided. The recommendations are categorized into three major components: screening for HIV transmission risk behaviors and STDs, providing brief behavioral risk-reduction interventions in the office setting and referring selected patients for additional prevention interventions and other related services, and facilitating notification and counseling of sex and needle-sharing partners of infected persons.

AB Injection-drug use is a risk factor for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Of the 765,559 cumulative AIDS cases diagnosed as of December 2000, a total of 193,527 (25%) occurred among injection-drug users (IDUs). IDUs become infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through sharing injection-drug equipment with HIV-infected persons or by engaging in other risk behaviors such as having unprotected sex. Since 1995, AIDS incidence among IDUs has declined. This report presents data on initial HIV diagnoses among IDUs aged >/=13 years, with and without AIDS at the time of HIV diagnosis, by year, during 1994--2000. The findings indicate that HIV diagnoses among IDUs have leveled in the majority of demographic groups during this period in the 25 states for which HIV surveillance data are available. Because IDUs and their sex partners represent approximately one third of persons infected in the HIV epidemic and continue to be at risk for transmitting HIV, prevention efforts targeting IDUs and their sex partners should be enhanced.

AB Numerous prevention programs aimed at reducing the use of stimulants (tobacco, alcohol, drugs) have been developed and examined during the past few decades. Most research has been conducted into school-based prevention programs. School-based prevention programs have been found to reduce the use of drugs to a certain extent, provided they use interactive methods where the focus is not on didactic presentations but on peer discussions, role-playing, and interaction between students. Promising interventions, but which have as yet been insufficiently researched for broad-scale dissemination, include family-based programs (courses for parents of adolescents), mass media campaigns and community interventions in which a combined package of interventions is organised within a specific region or town.

Initial investigation implicated consumption of raw, unpasteurized milk purchased at a local combination dairy-restaurant (dairy) during November 27-December 13, 2002, as the cause. This report summarizes the subsequent investigation. Because 27 states still allow the sale of raw milk, and organizations continue their efforts to allow marketing and sale of raw milk to the public directly from the farm, consumer education about the hazards of raw milk and a careful review of existing policies are needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Cue reactivity studies in alcohol-dependent adults have shown atypical physiological, cognitive, and neural responses to alcohol-related stimuli that differ from the responses of light drinkers. Cue reactivity and its neural substrates are unclear in youth. We hypothesized that teens with alcohol use disorder would show greater brain response than nonabusing teens to alcohol images relative to neutral beverage images in limbic and frontal brain regions.; METHODS: We tested the hypotheses in a cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Adolescents aged 14 to 17 were recruited from local high schools. Teens with alcohol use disorders (n = 15) and demographically similar infrequent drinkers (n = 15) met strict exclusion criteria (no left-handedness or neurological, other psychiatric, or other substance use disorders). Diagnoses were determined by means of structured and semistructured clinical interviews. Subjects were shown pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverage advertisements during blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Self-reports of craving were obtained before and after cue exposure.; RESULTS: Teens with alcohol use disorders showed substantially greater brain activation to alcoholic beverage pictures than control youths, predominantly in the left anterior, limbic, and visual system areas (P<.05; cluster threshold, 515 microL). The degree of brain response to the alcohol pictures was highest in youths who consumed more drinks per month and reported greater desires to drink.; CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous studies by demonstrating an association between the urge to drink alcohol and blood oxygen use in areas of the brain previously linked to reward, desire, positive affect, and episodic recall. This study extends this relationship to adolescents with relatively brief drinking histories using visual alcohol stimuli, and suggests a neural basis for response to alcohol advertisements in youths with drinking problems.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate which sociodemographic factors and behaviors are associated with breakfast skipping in adolescents and adults.; DESIGN: Five birth cohorts of adolescent twins and their parents received an extensive behavioral and medical self-report questionnaire that also assessed breakfast-eating frequency.; SETTING: Finland, 1991-1995.; SUBJECTS: A population sample of 16-y-old girls and boys (n=5448) and their parents (n=4660).; RESULTS: Parental breakfast eating was the statistically most significant factor associated with adolescent breakfast eating. Smoking, infrequent exercise, a low education level at 16, female sex, frequent alcohol use, behavioral disinhibition, and high body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with adolescent breakfast skipping. In adults, smoking, infrequent exercise, low education level, male sex, higher BMI, and more frequent alcohol use were associated with breakfast skipping. In the adult sample, older individuals had breakfast more often than younger ones. Both adults and adolescents who frequently skipped breakfast were much more likely to exercise very little compared to those who skipped breakfast infrequently. Breakfast skipping was associated with low family socioeconomic status in adults and adolescent boys, but not in girls. Breakfast skipping clustered moderately with smoking, alcohol use, and sedentary lifestyle in both adults and adolescents.; CONCLUSIONS: Breakfast skipping is associated with health-compromising behaviors in adults and adolescents. Individuals and families who skip breakfast may benefit from preventive efforts that also address risk behaviors other than eating patterns.; SPONSORSHIP: National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (AA08315), Academy of Finland (44069), European Union Fifth Framework Program (QLRT-1999-00916), Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation, and Jalmari and Rauha Ahokas Foundation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a widely used intervention to reduce college student alcohol use, we studied student drinking patterns at colleges that employed social norms marketing programs and those that did not.; METHOD: We examined responses of students in the Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study (CAS) 1997, 1999 and 2001 data sets at 37 colleges that employed social norms marketing programs and at 61 that did not. Information about the students' drinking behavior and their familiarity with social norms marketing messages at their schools was analyzed, as were college administrators' reports about the implementation of social norms marketing campaigns. Schools were grouped on the basis of student reports of exposure to programmatic materials. Trend analyses were conducted on seven standard measures of alcohol consumption, including annual and 30-day use, frequency, usual quantity and volume consumed, heavy episodic use, and drunkenness.; RESULTS: Almost half of the CAS colleges sampled adopted social norms programs. Those that did were more likely to have large enrollments, not to be religiously affiliated and to have high rates of alcohol use. No decreases were noted in any of the seven measures of alcohol use at schools with social norms programs, even when student exposure and length of program existence were considered. Increases in measures of monthly alcohol use and total volume consumed, however, were observed at schools employing social norms programs.; CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide evidence to support the effectiveness of social norms marketing programs, as currently utilized, in reducing alcohol use among college students.

AB OBJECTIVE: Alcohol dependence is a potent risk factor for completed suicide and medically serious attempts, but data are limited on factors that distinguish risk within this high-risk population. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for serious suicidal behavior among individuals with alcohol dependence.; METHOD: Data on completed suicides and medically serious suicide attempters and controls were gathered in the Canterbury region of New Zealand, using psychological autopsy methodology. A subsample of adult alcoholic subjects was selected for analyses yielding 38 completed suicides, 62 medically serious suicide attempters and 46 community controls, all with alcohol dependence (past month). Multinomial logistic analyses were used to compare the two case groups to controls on demographic and diagnostic variables.; RESULTS: Mood disorders and financial difficulties were more frequent among medically serious attempters than controls. Completed suicides were older and were more likely to be male, to have mood disorders, partner-relationship difficulties and other interpersonal life events than were controls. Completed suicides were older and more likely to be male than were medically serious attempters.; CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors in alcoholics are generally consistent with reports based on general samples of suicide and medically serious suicide attempts. Suicide prevention efforts in alcoholics, if they are to be successful, must include a focus on depression as well as interpersonal factors, including partner-relationship difficulties.

AB The objective of this study was to use administrative data to examine the effect of drug treatment completion on patients' subsequent employment and wages earned in the year following discharge, and to compare the consistency of these results across three states. Drug treatment and wage data from 20,495 drug treatment patients were used in this study. Treatment data were provided by the state substance abuse management information systems for Baltimore City, Washington State, and Oklahoma. Wage data were provided by the agency in each state responsible for collecting and reporting wage information. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare treatment completers and non-completers in the year after an index treatment episode. In addition, employment history in the year prior to the index episode was used to statistically adjust for group differences. The index episode of care may have included services under more than one treatment modality. The full social security number was used to link the drug treatment and wage administrative datasets. Treatment completers were 22% to 49% more likely than non-completers to be employed and to earn higher wages in the year following treatment, holding other variables constant. Patients staying in treatment longer than 90 days were 22% to 43% more likely to be employed in the year following treatment than those who stayed a shorter time. These findings were consistent across the three project states with different client populations, treatment delivery systems, and labor markets.

AB Two experiments investigated the processes through which post-message behavior (e.g., noncompliance) influences resistance to the message. Participants in Experiment 1 read preventive, consumer-education messages that either opposed the consumption of an alcohol-like product or recommended moderation. Half of the participants then tried the product, whereas the remaining participants performed a filler task. In the absence of trial, the two messages had the same effect. However, recipients of the abstinence-promoting preventive message who tried the product had stronger intentions to use the product in the future than recipients of the moderation message. This finding suggests that assessments of message impact may be inadequate unless an opportunity for trial is also provided. Results are interpreted in terms of self-perception and cognitive dissonance and contrasted from psychological reactance.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether increased knowledge and use of public health measures promoted for cholera prevention is reflected in lower prevalence of parasitic infection in households in a community in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, that is close to the border with the United States of America.; METHODS: Between 1994 and 1997, fecal samples from 438 children were collected through convenience sampling and then examined for helminth eggs/larvae and protozoan cysts as biologic indicators of household compliance with recommended cholera prevention measures. The suggested measures were to wash hands before meals and after defecation, to drink purified water, to wash fruits and vegetables, and to eat well-cooked food. In addition, information on the knowledge of and the use of cholera preventive measures was collected by interviews with adult informants in 252 households (186 of those households also provided a fecal sample for analysis).; RESULTS: Parasitic infections occurred in 131 of the 438 children (30%), who resided in 79 of the 186 households (42%) that provided fecal samples. Giardia lamblia accounted for 12.5% of all infections. Infections with Hymenolepis nana, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Enterobius vermicularis, Ancylostoma/Necator, Strongyloides stercoralis, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni, Entamoeba histolytica, Endolimax nana, and Iodamoeba butschlii were also noted. Infected children were older and more often had an infected sibling. Households with three or more children were also more likely to have an infected child. The primary caregivers in the households where at least one child had a parasitic infection were distinguished by their inability to list at least three cholera prevention measures from memory.; CONCLUSIONS: The 42% household prevalence of parasitic infection was relatively high and indicates that some residents of this community may not have fully embraced the public health education efforts promoted for prevention of cholera. The occurrence of nonpathogenic protozoan parasites such as Endolimax nana, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni, and I. butschlii are important bioindicators for the persistence of unhygienic behaviors that increase the risk of cholera and other infectious diseases dependent on fecal-oral transmission. Information obtained by similar studies can be useful for monitoring compliance with community health and hygiene programs and may indicate the need to intensify educational efforts for the prevention of diarrhea associated with enteric pathogens that cannot be controlled by drugs alone.

AB Emergence of new addictive substances and progressive increase of 'drug abuse" has become a serious problem in many countries. Despite legal restriction and administrative control, the use of illicit drugs (like opium, heroin, proxyvan, etc.) has increased considerably in many parts of Northeast India. A sample of 1831 people (age 10 years and above) were interviewed during 1997-1998 about their drug use habits, if any, and types of substance used, in Meghalaya and upper Assam. Prevalence of substance use was 29.4% tobacco (20.5% chewers and 12.7% smokers), 12.5% alcohol, and 4.9% opium. In Meghalaya, prevalence of tobacco use was high (41.7%), which was mainly due to the large number of female chewers and male smokers. Opium and cannabis users were mainly confined in Assam close to the Arunachal Pradesh border, indicating a regional influence. Wide differences were observed in the prevalence pattern of tobacco and alcohol use across location, sex, age, education, and occupation. An association of sociodemographic factors with substance use was documented. Religion and ethnic group have significant association with tobacco use patterns but are insignificant with regard to alcohol use. Use of multiple substances and use of cannabis as a substitute for opium are the major problems indicating drug dependence. Mean ages for substance use initiation were: 18.5 years for tobacco, 21.8 years for alcohol, and 25.8 years for opium. Not with-standing the study's limitations, these findings are useful for planned prevention efforts and formulation of a specific program considering the importance of regional and sociodemographic factors.

AB This study employs an implicit personality rating methodology from marketing research (the "shopping list" method) to investigate young adults' perceptions of young women who drink alcoholic beverages. Whereas there were some differences in perceptions of young women drinkers across the alcohol brands, the greatest differential in the personality ratings was caused by the mere presence or absence of alcohol. Young women who drink alcohol were described as being more "interesting" and "self-assured" than young women who do not drink. These positive traits were reliably ascribed to young women drinkers by both young adult men and young adult women and more strongly by those who themselves drink. Although it is possible that young women drinkers really are differentially interesting and self-assured, a more likely contributor to these perceptions is advertising aimed at the female drinker.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between body mass index (BMI) levels and various lifestyle variables related to physical activity and specific characteristics of a healthy eating pattern, using baseline cross-sectional data from the Wellness IN the Rockies project.; SUBJECTS: A total of 928 males and 889 females, aged 18-99 y, recruited from six rural communities in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.; MEASUREMENTS: Using BMI as the criterion, overweight was defined as a BMI >or=25 kg/m(2) and obesity was defined as a BMI >or=30 kg/m(2). All participants in this study completed a questionnaire that elicited sociodemographic information, self-reported height and weight, and data related to specific dietary intakes, eating-related behaviors, and physical activity behaviors and perceptions.; RESULTS: Prevalence of overweight was 70% in men and 59% in women. Increased likelihood of overweight or obesity was associated with greater frequency of the following: drinking sweetened beverages such as soft drinks/soda pop, ordering supersized portions, eating while doing other activities, and watching television. Other predictors were lower frequency of participation in physical activity and the perception of not getting as much exercise as needed.; CONCLUSIONS: The increased probability of having a high BMI in individuals who more often eat while doing another activity appears to be a novel finding that will need to be substantiated by additional research. The finding that the vast majority of overweight and obese respondents believed that they do not get as much exercise as needed strengthens the assertion that finding ways to increase participation in physical activity should remain a high priority in obesity prevention and intervention efforts at the community and individual levels.

AB A central sociological problem is the extent to which genetics and the environment influence human behavior. Studies of twins are a core method in attempts to disentangle and to determine the comparative strength of genetic and environmental influences on psychosocial outcomes. A critical assumption of twin studies is that both monozygotic "identical" twins and dizygotic "fraternal" twins share common social environments. Therefore, any greater similarity of monozygotic than dizygotic twins is attributed to genetic influences. This paper tests the equal environment assumption by examining the extent to which greater concordance of adolescent monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins results from social, as well as genetic, influences. Bivariate comparisons indicate that monozygotic twins show greater similarity than dizygotic twins in socially-based characteristics including physical attractiveness, time spent in each other's company, the overlap in friendship networks, and friends' use of alcohol. Multivariate analyses indicate that measures of the social environment sometimes reduce or eliminate apparent genetic effects. In comparison with genetic indicators, social variables are usually stronger predictors of depression and alcohol use and abuse. These findings suggest that past twin studies could overstate the strength of genetic influences because some similarities in behavior among monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins stem from social influences.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review studies of adolescent substance use and abuse with genetically informative designs.; METHOD: Twin and adoption studies of adolescent substance use were searched in Medline using keywords.; RESULTS: Of 19 studies that used adolescent samples, 18 examined initiation or use of substances and 1 examined abuse. Of the 7 retrospective studies using adult samples, 6 examined problematic behaviors such as substance dependence. Genetic and shared environmental influences on adolescent substance use are moderated by the specific substance, age, gender, specific contexts, religiousness, and region. There is some evidence for a common genetic influence on substance use across substances. Genetic influences on adolescent substance use may act through an influence on disinhibited behavior. Shared environment contributed to adolescent substance use consistently across all adolescent samples and common shared environmental influences influenced initiation into tobacco and alcohol use. While parental alcohol use had a small influence on adolescent shared environment, sibling influences were substantial.; CONCLUSIONS: Twin and adoption studies have increased our understanding of genetic and environmental influences on adolescent substance use and its initiation; however, more studies focusing on clinical syndromes of abuse and dependence are needed.

AB Karaoke singing is a very popular entertainment among young people in Asia. It is a leisure singing activity with the singer's voice amplified with special acoustic effects in the backdrop of music. Music video and song captions are shown on television screen to remind the singers during singing. It is not uncommon to find participants singing continuously for four to five hours each time. As most of the karaoke singers have no formal training in singing, these amateur singers are more vulnerable to developing voice problems under these intensive singing activities. This study reports the performance of 20 young amateur singers (10 males and 10 females, aged between 20-25 years) on a series of phonatory function tasks carried out during continuous karaoke singing. Half of the singers were given water to drink and short duration of vocal rests at regular intervals during singing and the other half sang continuously without taking any water or rest. The subjects who were given hydration and vocal rests sang significantly longer than those who did not take any water or rest. The voice quality, as measured by perceptual and acoustic measures, and vocal function, as measured by phonetogram, did not show any significant changes during singing in the subjects who were given water and rest during the singing. However, subjects who sang continuously without drinking water and taking rests showed significant changes in the jitter measure and the highest pitch they could produce during singing. These results suggest that hydration and vocal rests are useful strategies to preserve voice function and quality during karaoke singing. This information is useful educational information for karaoke singers.

Valid methods of monitoring the incidence and prevalence of youth problems increasingly shape preventive practice. The identification of empirically supported prevention interventions is becoming more sophisticated, and numerous scientific organizations have begun to engage in dissemination activities. These trends will be accelerated by increased media advocacy for the use of scientific methods and findings, the development of a registry of preventive trials, achievement of consensus about the standards for identifying disseminable interventions, and increased research on the factors that influence the effective implementation of science-based practices.

AB CONTEXT: Adolescent drinking is a major public health concern. The federal government does not restrict alcohol advertising to adolescents, but relies on the alcohol industry for self-regulation.; OBJECTIVES: To investigate recent alcohol advertising in magazines and to determine whether advertising frequency is associated with adolescent readership.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: All alcohol advertisements were counted that appeared from 1997-2001 in 35 of 48 major US magazines, which tracked their adolescent readership (3 refused all alcohol advertisements; and advertisement counts were unavailable for 10). Variation was assessed in the advertisement placement frequency for each major category of alcohol (beer, wine and wine coolers, and distilled liquor) by a magazine's adolescent readership (age 12-19 years), young adult readership (age 20-24 years), and older adult readership (age > or =25 years); readership demographics (sex, race, and income); year; frequency of publication; and cost per advertisement.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Variation in alcohol advertising frequency by adolescent readership.; RESULTS: Adolescent readership ranged from 1.0 to 7.1 million. The alcohol industry placed 9148 advertisements at a cost of 696 million dollars. Of the 9148 advertisements, 1201 (13%) were for beer, 443 (5%) for wine, and 7504 (82%) for liquor. After adjustment for other magazine characteristics, the advertisement rate ratio was 1.6 times more for beer (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.6; P =.05) and liquor (95% CI, 1.1-2.3; P =.01) for every additional million adolescent readers. Wine industry advertising was not associated with adolescent readership.; CONCLUSIONS: Magazine advertising by the beer and liquor industries is associated with adolescent readership. Industry and federal policymakers should examine ways to regulate advertising that reaches large numbers of adolescents.

AB AIMS: To investigate the relationship between several indicators of socioeconomic status and drinking patterns in young adulthood.; DESIGN: Data collected in a longitudinal study of young adults was analysed using repeated-measures models to examine the relationship between income, occupational activity and educational achievement and patterns of drinking.; SETTING: These data were collected as part of a longitudinal study ofa birth cohort of New Zealanders. They were interviewed for the most part in a central location using a face-to-face method and a computer-assisted alcohol interview.; PARTICIPANTS: The participants were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development study aged 18, 21 and 26 years. Nine hundred and sixty-nine study members contributed to the analysis. Study members have been found to be broadly representative of the New Zealand population and cross national studies suggest findings are generalizable to other similar market economies.; MEASUREMENTS: Three indicators of socioeconomic status were used; educational achievement, occupational activity and income. The educational achievement indicator at age 18 had three levels that ranged from no school qualifications to higher school qualifications. For age 21 two additional categories of tertiary educational achievement were included to make five categories and for age 26 higher tertiary degrees were included in the measure to make six categories. Five categories of occupational activity were used. Income data was also used. Two measures of alcohol consumption were used. These were the frequency of drinking and the typical quantity of alcohol consumed per drinking occasion in the past year.; FINDINGS: Frequency of drinking increased over these early adult years and the quantities consumed peaked at age 21 and decreased thereafter for both males and females. Frequency of drinking was influenced by income with the higher income respondents drinking more often and this was persistent overtime. Quantity of drinking was most influenced by educational achievement. The less well-educated young adult drank significantly more during a drinking occasion and at all ages. There was also a relationship between educational achievement and frequency of drinking for males at age 18 and a relationship between women's occupational activity and the quantities they consumed.; CONCLUSIONS: The finding that the dimensions of drinking operate differently explains the lack of consistency in previous research, which has investigated socioeconomic status and the volumes of alcohol consumed. The findings of higher quantities consumed among those of lower social status may explain some of the reduced life expectancy found among those with lower socioeconomic status.

AB BACKGROUND: Little research (and fewer interventions) has been done on longitudinal exposure to risk factors for chronic diseases in young people in Latin America, including Mexico, although chronic diseases constitute the first cause of death in Mexico. Our objective was to document the prevalence of chronic disease risk factors among adolescents as a baseline measurement for a cohort study and to develop educational interventions.; METHODS: Questionnaires, blood samples, and anthropometric measurements were collected from 13,293 public school students of both sexes, ages 11-24 years in Morelos, Mexico. This constitutes the baseline measurement for a cohort study. Twenty focus groups and 10 in-depth interviews were done with girls aged 12-17 years. Two educational interventions promoting physical activity and sexual health were designed.; RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 21.2%. On average, participants spent 0.5 h/day on vigorous physical activity and 3.7 h/day watching television. Sexual initiation was reported by 14.5% (girls = 9.1%, boys = 21.5%); 52.3% of whom reported using condoms. Young women demonstrated correct condom use and perceived themselves at risk for HIV/AIDS but did not have condom negotiation skills. Prevalence of experimenting with tobacco was 15.1% (girls = 10.4%, boys = 21.1%); current smoking was 14.4% (girls = 10.6%) and boys = 19.2%), while 6.3% of participants reported monthly intoxication with alcohol, and 4.5% reported past and 2.1% reported current illegal drug use.; CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate substantial exposure to risk factors for chronic diseases and reproductive health problems in this population. The study will generate interventions and constitutes initiation of a longitudinal study able to explore causal associations between risk factors and chronic diseases in this population.

AB Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States, accounting for approximately 100,000 deaths annually. Efforts to reduce the adverse health and social consequences from alcohol use include policies to restrict access to alcohol among underaged persons (i.e., persons aged <21 years) and to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among persons of all ages. Recent studies have focused on alcohol marketing as a potentially important contributor to alcohol consumption, particularly among underage drinkers. Point-of-purchase (POP) (i.e., on-site) marketing, including alcohol advertising and placement, can increase alcohol sales and consumption substantially, thereby increasing the risk for various alcohol-related health outcomes, including alcohol-impaired driving and interpersonal violence. To assess the type and frequency of POP alcohol marketing, researchers with the ImpacTeen Project collected and analyzed store observation data during 2000-2001 from 3,961 alcohol retailers in 329 communities throughout the United States. This report summarizes the results of the study, which indicate that POP alcohol marketing is extensive in certain store types frequented by teenagers and young adults. Public health agencies and policy makers should work with liquor control boards to reduce POP marketing that could promote risky or underage drinking.

AB BACKGROUND: On July 1st, 1999, the spirits market in Switzerland was reformed based on the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement. The tax reform, in addition to increased competition, has resulted in a 30-50% decrease in price for foreign spirits (liquor). The purpose of the present study is to examine whether decreased prices due to the tax reform and the liberalized spirits market in Switzerland have had an effect on spirits consumption, and whether the effect differs by demographic and other correlates.; METHODS: The present study uses data from a longitudinal study on changes in alcohol consumption in Switzerland's resident population. The baseline survey was conducted 3 months before the tax reform and the follow-up was conducted 28 months after the tax reform. A randomly selected sample of 4007 residents aged 15 years or older participated in the baseline survey and 73% in the follow-up survey. The data were obtained by computer-assisted telephone interview, including detailed questions on alcohol consumption, drinking habits, problem drinking, purchase of spirits and socio-demographic characteristics.; RESULTS: Consumption of spirits increased after the price of spirits decreased. The increase in spirits consumption was consistent across subgroups, with the exception of the group aged 60 or older. Moreover, the increase in spirits consumption persisted even after adjustment for significant correlates of spirits consumption. Apart from age, there was no evidence that the increase in spirits consumption differed between subgroups as defined by sex, region, working status, education, smoking, drinking frequency, or average number of drinks.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that younger people are more affected by price than older persons. This study demonstrated that price should be considered an effective policy to reduce alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems, especially among the younger population.

AB Cigarette smoking remains a substantial threat to the current and future health of America's youth. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk and protective factors for cigarette smoking among US adolescents. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health was used, comparing the responses of all non-smokers at Time 1 for their ability to predict the likelihood of smoking at Time 2, one year later. Data was stratified into four gender by grade group cohorts. Cross-cutting risk factors for smoking among all four cohorts were: using alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs; violence involvement; having had sex; having friends who smoke and learning problems. Having a higher grade point average and family connectedness were protective across all cohorts. Other gender and grade group specific risk and protective factors were identified. The estimated probability of initiating smoking decreased by 19.2% to 54.1% both in situations of high and low risk as the number of protective factors present increased. Of the factors that predict or protect against smoking some are influential across all gender and grade group cohorts studied, while others are specific to gender and developmental stage. Prevention efforts that target both the reduction of risk factors and enhancement of protective factors at the individual, family, peer group and community are likely to reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation.

AB PURPOSE: To identify predictors of the transition from experimentation to regular smoking in middle adolescence, late adolescence, and young adulthood.; METHODS: California and Oregon students completed self-report surveys assessing the following potential predictors of the transition to regular smoking from grades 8 to 10 (n = 2,496), grades 10 to 12 (n = 2,149), and grade 12 to age 23 years (n = 1,534): demographic characteristics; smoking-related attitudes, behaviors and environment; other problem behaviors; academic orientation; parental bonding; and mental health. Huberized regression techniques, which adjust for weighting and clustering of observations, were used to determine the independent associations of the predictor variables on subsequent smoking status.; RESULTS: Risk factors for the transition to regular smoking during middle adolescence included being white, prosmoking attitudes, friend smoking, weak academic orientation, and less parental support. During late adolescence, being African-American was protective, whereas risk factors included prosmoking attitudes, drinking, non-intact nuclear family, and less parental support. Risk factors in young adulthood included younger age and prosmoking attitudes.; CONCLUSIONS: Results point to several smoking-related attitudes, social influences, and behaviors that prevention efforts may target to curb the escalation of smoking.

AB Public opinion has been one factor affecting change in policies designed to reduce underage alcohol use. Extant research, however, has been criticized for using single survey items of unknown reliability to define adult attitudes on alcohol policy issues. The present investigation addresses a critical gap in the literature by deriving scales on public attitudes, knowledge, and concerns pertinent to alcohol policies designed to reduce underage drinking using a US probability sample survey of 7021 adults. Five attitudinal scales were derived from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses addressing policies to: (1) regulate alcohol marketing, (2) regulate alcohol consumption in public places, (3) regulate alcohol distribution, (4) increase alcohol taxes, and (5) regulate youth access. The scales exhibited acceptable psychometric properties and were largely consistent with a rational framework which guided the survey construction.

AB Prevention efforts would be enhanced by identification of factors that increase the greater relative risk of some college students for dangerous activities such as heavy drinking, illicit drug use, and unsafe sex. Students with Cloninger's [Science 236 (1987) 410.] "Type II" personality characteristics or with psychopathic traits were compared on indices of drinking and risk-taking, and potential mechanisms of unique behavioral patterns were explored. Freshmen (N=331, 50% male) completed self-report measures from which students with Type II and psychopathic traits were identified and compared with the remaining sample. Students with Type II traits reported heavy drinking and frequent intoxicated risk-taking, whereas students with psychopathic traits reported frequent sober risk-taking. Both groups held strong positive outcome expectancies, yet only those with Type II traits reported weak negative outcome expectancies. Moreover, negative outcome expectancies mediated the relation between Type II traits and intoxicated risk-taking. The collective findings suggest that Type II and psychopathic traits underlie differing behavioral profiles, and that students with Type II traits may take risks when intoxicated due to limited recognition of potential negative behavioral consequences.

AB Applying survival analysis methodology to age-of-onset data from an adoption study (N = 196), we present evidence that risks for both drug use and drug problems (DSM abuse or dependence) are elevated when combined antisocial personality (ASP) and substance abuse is present in the same biological parent. It is increased not only in comparison to adoptees with no known biological risk, but also when compared to adoptees with a biological background for only substance problems or only ASP. Neither of these later groups showed a statistically higher risk when compared with controls. Among adoptees with recurrent drug use, adolescent aggressivity is also elevated when the combined substance abuse/ASP biological diathesis is present. Statistical control for aggressivity diminished but did not eliminate the predictive significance of the combined biological diathesis for drug problems. We also verify, using more refined methodology, our previous reports of gender and adverse adoptive environmental influences on drug-related outcomes in these subjects. We could not document a biology-environment interaction, but power to do so was rather low. We argue that the observed biological associations are broadly consistent with generalization to other substances of an alcoholism phenotype similar to Cloninger's Type II or Babor's Type B.

AB Although alcohol consumption is a problem on the college campus, beliefs and behaviors predictive of alcohol use are in development in children as young as third grade. Because they develop partially in response to interpretations of media messages, for which parents can have an influence, this study examined how college students' (N=300) recollections of parental reinforcement of media messages associated with alcohol-related beliefs and behaviors. Structural equation modeling showed that recalled positive mediation negatively predicted skepticism, and positively predicted desirability and expectancies. Desirability of media messages predicted more positive norms perceptions, and a lack of skepticism predicted more positive expectancies. With age of first experimentation controlled, expectancies predicted heavier current drinking behavior. Norms did not predict behavior, and positive mediation did not predict norms. The study concludes that to the extent parental communication leads adolescents to interpret media messages less skeptically, they encourage adolescents to find alcohol portrayals appealing. This in turn appears to lead toward more risky behaviors. The results suggest that college-based anti-alcohol campaigns can benefit by acknowledging the appeal of competing messages and by including parents as a campaign target.

AB Millions of children are affected by physical and sexual abuse, natural and technological disasters, transportation accidents, invasive medical procedures, exposure to community violence, violence in the home, assault, and terrorism. Unfortunately, the emotional impact of exposure to trauma on children is often unappreciated and therefore untreated, and yet the impact of exposures to disaster and violence is profound and long-lasting. This article first briefly discusses the epidemiology of trauma in children, and then reviews the psychiatric and neurodevelopmental impact of trauma on children as well as the effects of trauma on children's emotional development. Trauma in children can lead to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder as well as to a variety of other psychiatric disorders, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, borderline personality disorder, and substance abuse in adult survivors of trauma. Research has found that early exposure to stress and trauma causes physical effects on neurodevelopment which may lead to changes in the individual's long-term response to stress and vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. Exposure to trauma also affects children's ability to regulate, identify, and express emotions, and may have a negative effect on the individual's core identity and ability to relate to others. The authors also discuss what has been learned, based on recent experiences such as the World Trade Center catastrophe, about the role of television viewing in increasing the effects of traumatic events. The last section of the article provides guidance concerning the identification and clinical treatment of children and adolescents who are having emotional problems as a result of exposure to trauma.

AB OBJECTIVE: Research has consistently shown an association between levels of parental drinking and adolescent alcohol use. Different mechanisms offered to explain this association include environmental mechanisms such as social learning and biological mechanisms such as genetic transmission. To integrate these perspectives, this study examines the moderation of environmental and genetic influences on adolescent alcohol use by parental drinking behaviors.; METHOD: The data used were 1,833 pairs drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health's monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, fill-sibling and half-sibling pairs. Analyses used Defries-Fulker (DF) models to estimate genetic and shared environmental influences and to evaluate the potential moderation of these influences by household parental drinking.; RESULTS: Full sample results revealed that genetic influences (h2 = 0.46, p < .05) were significant but that shared environmental influences (c2 = 0.10, p > .05) were not. Separate DF analyses for male, female and mixed-gender pairs found the magnitude of genetic and shared environmental influences on adolescents to be similar across male and female pairs. Results for mixed-gender pairs, however, were ambiguous. Extended DF models examining interactions between parental drinking and the expression of genetic and shared environmental influences found parental drinking was associated with a higher expression of genetic influences among male pairs but not among female or mixed-gender pairs.; CONCLUSIONS: The main inferences to be drawn are that, at least for male adolescents, genetic influences on drinking appear to be potentiated by exposure to parental drinking.

AB To evaluate the prevalence and indicators of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Houston and determine the effectiveness of targeted HCV screening in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. We performed a cross-sectional survey in low-risk and high-risk groups in Houston. This included a blinded survey of HCV conducted in 1010 STD clinic clients having serological syphilis tests, and 1885 multi-speciality group practice patients having metabolic blood work. This was followed with a targeted hepatitis C survey of 822 high-risk clients from STD clinics. The seroprevalence of hepatitis C infection in the blinded survey was 3.9% (95% CI 3.0-4.8) in the multi-speciality group and 5.0% (95% CI 3.7-6.3) in the STD clinics. Prevalence of hepatitis C infection among targeted STD clinic clients was significantly higher at 15.3% (95% CI 12.7-17.7). Risk factors that correlated with HCV infection after logistic regression included: injection drug use (OR = 10, 95% CI = 3.4-30.3), heroin use (OR = 6.6, 95% CI = 2.2-20.5), non-transfusion/ transplantation blood exposure (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.3-6.9), sharing equipment to snort drugs (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.4), and age above 25 years (OR = 51, 95% CI = 9-47). This study demonstrates that targeting clients in STD clinics for known risk behaviours is an effective way to identify cases of HCV infection. STD clinics allow access to clients with both drug use and sexual risk behaviours and are a useful location for targeting hepatitis C screening and prevention efforts.

AB PURPOSE: To examine the effects on early high-risk driving behavior of changes over time (trajectories) in adolescent alcohol use, friends' support for drinking, susceptibility to peer pressure, and tolerance of deviance.; METHODS: Statewide driving data were obtained for 4813 subjects who had completed at least two previous school-based questionnaires. The self-administered questionnaire data provided predictor measures from 5th through 10th grades. Trajectory information on predictor measures was summarized using each measure's slope over time and level at the 10th grade data collection (last value). Regression models used serious offenses, alcohol-related offenses, serious crashes, and alcohol-related crashes as outcomes, trajectory measures as predictors, and produced parameter estimates adjusted for demographic measures. Probabilities of having a serious offense or serious crash for five sample trajectories on each measure were obtained from the estimated regression models.; RESULTS: All four predictor measures were important, particularly in predicting serious offenses, alcohol-related offenses, and alcohol-related crashes. The highest probabilities for young adult high-risk driving were found among those with consistently high or increasingly high trajectories of friends' support for drinking, susceptibility to peer pressure, and tolerance of deviance.; CONCLUSIONS: Programs to prevent adolescent risk behavior should take into account environmental and personality influences. Prevention efforts need to emphasize preserving low levels, preventing increases, and promoting decreases over time of adolescent risk factors for unhealthy behaviors, such as high-risk driving.

AB OBJECTIVE: Since market liberalization in 1987, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau (TTWMB) annual statistics indicate that both the demand for imported cigarettes as well as the number of seized smuggled packs have increased with an average revenue loss of NT dollars 4942 million over the past 15 years. The NT dollars 10 average increase in cigarette prices after Taiwan entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the implementation of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Law in 2002 are forcing policy makers to examine smuggling even more closely. This study evaluates factors that affect an individual smoker's decision to purchase smuggled cigarettes, particularly when faced with higher prices.; DESIGN: 437 male smokers of imported cigarettes were drawn from a national interview survey on cigarette consumption, which the Division of Health Policy Research at the National Health Research Institutes conducted during the year 2000. Multiple logistic regression models were used to analyse the behaviour of purchasing smuggled cigarettes with respect to demographic factors, economic factors, smoking behaviour, and other variables.; RESULTS: Cigarette price was the driving factor most closely linked to the purchase of smuggled cigarettes--a 1% increase in cigarette price raised the likelihood of purchasing smuggled cigarettes at least 2.60 times (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.26). Smokers who spent more than NT 1000/month dollars on cigarettes were twice as likely to purchase smuggled cigarettes as those who spent less than NT 1000 dollars (odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.70). Betel nut chewers were more likely to purchase smuggled cigarettes (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.90). Smokers who opposed cigarette taxation policy were 1.69 times more likely to buy smuggled cigarettes. Personal income was not significantly associated with smuggled cigarettes purchases.; CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates what causes smokers to purchase smuggled cigarettes. We have determined that cigarette price is the most important factor and that betel nut vendors are the main suppliers. Our study provides policy makers with information that can help them develop effective strategies to curb cigarette smuggling after Taiwan's recent cigarette tax reform, which has increased cigarette prices.

AB Legislative changes and public media campaigns to prevent impaired driving are often cited as explanations for the reduction in the rate of impaired crashes over the past 25 years in most of the industrialized world. Other factors may have contributed to these reductions, such as changes in the age and sex distribution of the driver population. The primary purpose of this article is to assess the extent to which the reduction in impaired crashes in Ontario, Canada, may be attributable to the changing age and sex distribution of drivers. In Ontario, the rate of impaired crashes declined by 78.1% from 1974 to 1999. During this time period, the average age of drivers increased from 39.4 years in 1974 to 43.2 in 1999. Similarly, from 1974 to 1999 the percentage of all drivers that were women increased from 39.6% to 46.8%. Since statistics show the likelihood of impaired crashes is lower for both older drivers and women, the reduction of impaired crashes is partially due to these demographic changes. Using indirect standardization, the aging population accounted for an 8.6% decline in the rate of impaired crashes. The changing sex distribution of drivers accounted for a 9.4% decline in impaired crashes. Other global factors may also help to explain the reduction of impaired crashes, such as general road safety improvements and reductions in per adult consumption of alcohol.

A content analysis of photographs on these sites assessed the demographics of individuals depicted and the amount of smoking and nudity in the photographs. The sample included 30 Web sites, all of which were accessible to youth and did not require age verification services to enter them. Cigarette brand names were mentioned in writing on 35% of the sites, and brand images were present on 24% of the sites. Nearly all of the photographs (95%) depicted smoking, 92% featured women, and 7% contained partial or full nudity. These results underscore the need for greater research and monitoring of smoking-related Internet content by health educators and tobacco control advocates.

AB CONTEXT: Previous studies have reported that early initiation of cannabis (marijuana) use is a significant risk factor for other drug use and drug-related problems.; OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the association between early cannabis use and subsequent progression to use of other drugs and drug abuse/dependence persists after controlling for genetic and shared environmental influences.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in 1996-2000 among an Australian national volunteer sample of 311 young adult (median age, 30 years) monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twin pairs discordant for early cannabis use (before age 17 years).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported subsequent nonmedical use of prescription sedatives, hallucinogens, cocaine/other stimulants, and opioids; abuse or dependence on these drugs (including cannabis abuse/dependence); and alcohol dependence.; RESULTS: Individuals who used cannabis by age 17 years had odds of other drug use, alcohol dependence, and drug abuse/dependence that were 2.1 to 5.2 times higher than those of their co-twin, who did not use cannabis before age 17 years. Controlling for known risk factors (early-onset alcohol or tobacco use, parental conflict/separation, childhood sexual abuse, conduct disorder, major depression, and social anxiety) had only negligible effects on these results. These associations did not differ significantly between monozygotic and dizygotic twins.; CONCLUSIONS: Associations between early cannabis use and later drug use and abuse/dependence cannot solely be explained by common predisposing genetic or shared environmental factors. The association may arise from the effects of the peer and social context within which cannabis is used and obtained. In particular, early access to and use of cannabis may reduce perceived barriers against the use of other illegal drugs and provide access to these drugs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To summarize epidemiological studies providing data on prevalence, incidence, comorbidity, natural course, risk factors and consequences of social phobia (SP).; METHOD: Data from cross-sectional studies and prospective longitudinal studies in particular are considered.; RESULTS: These studies portray SP as a frequent mental disorder, which begins typically in early adolescence, and is highly comorbid with other anxiety disorders, as well as secondary depression and substance abuse disorders. Several possible risk factors have already been identified for the onset and unfavorable course of SP; some of them have been tested in prospective longitudinal studies. SP is a chronic disorder when compared with other mental disorders and when subclinical symptomatic levels are considered. Impairment caused by SP is considerable and increases over a patient's life span. The negative impact of SP is not only reflected in subjective well-being and reduced quality of life but also in social role functioning, and it impacts negatively on career progression.; CONCLUSION: Prospective longitudinal studies in representative samples drawn from the general population provide information that allows the overall direct and indirect costs of the disorder (treatment costs, disability, social welfare) to be determined, and enables an improvement in long-term care strategies as well as preventive efforts to be established.

A sample of 502 newspaper and magazine articles published in 1998 was researched using content analysis. The drugs most frequently featured in the headlines were tobacco (18.1%), coca-derived drugs (9.2%), marijuana (9.2%), alcoholic beverages (8.6%), and anabolic steroids (7.4%). Solvents were featured in only one article, although they are the most commonly used drug in Brazil, second only to alcohol and tobacco. These data indicate an imbalance between the journalistic approach and the epidemiological profile of psychoactive drug consumption in Brazil. Dependence was the most frequent consequence mentioned in the articles (46%), followed by violence (9.2%), withdrawal syndrome (8.0%), and AIDS (6.8%). The focus of the articles varied according to the drug in question. While articles on marijuana focused on its therapeutic use and legalization, those on cocaine-related issues discussed both the damage caused by consumption as well as various interventions (treatment and repression).

On average, drinkers reported having 5 or more drinks almost 5 times during the fall semester, and having 8 or more drinks almost twice during the same period. The groups reporting the highest rates of heavy drinking were males, those living in university residences, those with low academic orientation and those with high recreational orientation.; INTERPRETATION: Generally, this study has shown that heavy drinking is highly engrained in Canadian undergraduates' drinking patterns, and is related to a number of factors. These factors can be used to develop targeted prevention efforts.

AB The objective of this study was to ascertain the relationship among intravenous drug users between high levels of HIV risk-taking and both (a) deaths of significant others experienced before age 15, and (b) unresolved mourning; 592 out-of-treatment intravenous drug users (71.4% male; mean age = 40.5), stratified as to zip code, were recruited in San Jose, CA, as part of a CDC multisite investigation of access to sterile needles and HIV infection. HIV serostatus tests were obtained and an individual, structured interview administered covering demographics, employment, mental health, HIV risk-taking behavior, family contacts/closeness, and family deaths/mourning. Multivariate analyses indicated that the extent of HIV risk-taking in adulthood was highly and positively related to (a) the number of close-family-member deaths participants experienced as youth, (b) the extent to which respondents effectively mourned sudden family losses, (c) the extent to which those lost were emotionally close to the respondent, and (d) whether or not the respondent attended the funerals of lost relatives. Canonical correlations between sets of death/mourning and HIV risk-taking variables were .55 for the total sample (p < .001) and .70 for the subsample who experienced early and sudden family deaths (p < .001). In both analyses, it made little difference if age and gender were partialed out. These findings give credence to the importance of (a) unexpected deaths experienced early in life, and (b) related, inadequate mourning, as factors in progressively higher adult HIV risk-taking. They suggest that treatment for such individuals and their families should involve grief work dealing with unresolved losses within the family of origin. In addition, prevention efforts may have to revise their modus operandi toward both more focused and more family-based methods of outreach and engagement.

AB Two hundred college students participated in an experiment investigating how individuals use television and real world experiences to construct alcohol use schema. Students were asked to write a story about a student who had a difficult day and, on arriving home, fixed himself a drink. In randomly assigned conditions, directions led the student to believe this was to be either a real world scenario or the setting for a television episode. Stories were coded for setting and social nature of use, quantity of use, consequences (both severity and valence), and overall tone. In general, stories characterized alcohol use as heavy, social, relaxing, and resulting in mostly minor consequences. Story characteristics did not differ based on direction type (real world vs. TV scenario). Students also completed a series of measures regarding television viewing habits, attitudes about alcohol use, and past experiences with use. Regarding television viewing patterns, those who watched more television overall created stories with more alcohol use. Viewing of dramas in particular was associated with less severe consequences as a result of use. In terms of personal experience with use, individuals who had driven under the influence of alcohol were more likely to construct a story with a positive tone and those who had passed out from drinking were less likely to conclude their stories with a moral tale discouraging drinking. The conclusion of this research is that both personal and observed experiences are important influencing factors in individuals' schema regarding alcohol use.

Despite widespread acceptance among health educators, empirical results are clouded by measurement problems. This study, based on a random sample of 550 students, examined the effects of misperceptions of friends' and typical college students' drinking on one's drinking behavior. Results indicate that drinking behavior is positively related to perceptions of friends' drinking as suggested by the theory of planned behavior, which emphasizes subjective as opposed to social norms.

AB This research investigated the prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and substance abuse in a midwestern university population following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington, DC. Three-hundred five subjects volunteered to complete a questionnaire which measured nine areas of psychosocial functioning which included demographics, personality, PTSD, MDD, prior traumatic experiences, alcohol and drug use, psychiatric history and treatment, and current attitudes towards government, religion, the economy, and how children were affected by the events. The participants lived in a large urban city over which United Flight 93 circled before crashing in Pennsylvania due to terrorist attacks. The subjects were forced to evacuate their university and city due to attacks on New York and errant United Flight 93. The study also replicated the first two national studies on PTSD prevalence (Schuster, et al., 2002; Galea, et al., 2002). The results found a prevalence rate of 5.9% for probable PTSD, matching identically previous national surveys. There were higher levels of PTSD and MDD for females, those with less education and who were single or unmarried, and those who had a prior history of mental health problems or psychological trauma. PTSD and MDD were associated with higher levels of alcohol and drug use since September 11. Relations to active duty military personnel appear to moderate the perception of threat, suggesting the importance of affiliative kinship patterns to coping with stress. Finally, the concept of geographic and psychological proximity to the 'zone of danger' is discussed.

AB In an interdisciplinary approach the exposure to lead and cadmium of the population living in the vicinity of a Bulgarian non-ferrous metallurgical plant was studied to determine the routes of exposure. Two exposed villages situated 4 and 6 km SW and W, respectively,--in the plume of the plant's emissions--and a village for comparison situated 14 km SE of the plant were selected for the study. The blood of children aged 3-13 years from the exposed villages (n = 111) and the village for comparison (n = 18) was analyzed for lead (PbB) and cadmium (CdB) as well as for free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) and haematological parameters. A personal questionnaire concerning nutrition habits and life-style was filled in by interviewers of the children's parents. The cadmium levels in blood were within the variation range stated for Bulgaria. The exposed children had a mean CdB of 0.38 +/- 0.18 microgram/l (range 0.10-0.90 microgram/l) and the comparison group 0.31 +/- 0.35 microgram/l (0.06-1.42 micrograms/l). The mean PbB value measured in the exposed children was 240 +/- 96 micrograms/l (77-631 micrograms/l), while the mean value of PbB for the reference group was 149 +/- 57 micrograms/l (63-285 micrograms/l). Individual PbB levels > 150 and > 200 micrograms/l were found in 85% and 62%, respectively, of the exposed children and FEP > 80 micrograms/dl erythrocytes was detected in 21%. There was a concentration-response and a concentration-effect relationship (r = 0.51, D > 0.001) between PbB and FEP. According to the questionnaire only 10.3% of the interviewed families in the two exposed villages buy all food from the market, the others produce a significant part of their food themselves. The PbB levels of children who consume certain foods of local production (cabbage, cereals, poultry, and beef) were significantly higher compared to the PbB values of children whose families purchase these foods from the market. No significant relationship between lead in children's blood and the use of tin and ceramic utensils, drinking and irrigation water, hygiene habits, family tobacco smoking habits, playgrounds and traffic intensity were revealed. There was a significantly higher incidence of prematurely born babies in the exposed population. The proven relationship between lead intake via the food chain and existing significant health risks is the basis for risk communication. Measures aimed at healthier nutrition and life-style intend to contribute to decreasing the risk of the population living in the smelter region.

AB The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or "ecstasy") appears to be increasing worldwide, with "rave" attendees being one high-risk population. To date, however, only one study has collected ecstasy use information from rave attendees in the United States. To address this limitation, we collected self-report drug use information from 70 adult "club rave" attendees within the Baltimore-Washington corridor in April and May 2002. Data collection was scheduled between 12 A.M. and 5 A.M. Participation rates were high, with 85 percent of the club rave attendees completing the interview. Eighty-six percent of the respondents reported lifetime ecstasy use, 51 percent reported 30-day use, and 30 percent reported using ecstasy within the two days preceding the interview. While past-year ecstasy users were comparable to non-users with respect to a host of demographic and drug use variables, non-ecstasy users were significantly more likely than past-year users to perceive risks associated with the regular use of alcohol and ecstasy. Not surprisingly, non-ecstasy users were significantly more likely than past-year users to perceive harmful long-term physical and psychological effects associated with ecstasy ingestion. These findings suggest that rave attendees may be an important population for ecstasy-related prevention efforts.

AB When Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris's home run record in September of 1998, he was instantly declared an American hero and held up as a positive role model for teenagers and young adults. The extensive media attention focused on McGwire made the general public aware of his use of a muscle-building dietary supplement, Androstenedione. It also increased the public's awareness of McGwire's public service to prevent child abuse. The present research assesses audience involvement with McGwire through parasocial interaction and identification, and the effects of that involvement on audience knowledge of and attitudes toward Androstenedione and child abuse prevention. Results indicate parasocial interaction with an athlete regarded as a public role model likely leads to audience identification with that person, which in turn promotes certain attitudes and beliefs. In this case, parasocial interaction and identification with Mark McGwire was strongly associated with knowledge of Androstenedione, intended use of the supplement, and concern for child abuse. Implications of this research for featuring celebrities in health communication campaigns are discussed.

AB This paper presents the results of the Nationwide Campuses Study that measure the impact of programs supported by the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) for collegiate alcohol and other drug (AOD) prevention efforts. Outcomes were measured by using standardized pre- and post-program items on the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey and adjusted prevalences of AOD use. Although student awareness of AOD prevention programs increased during the funding period, there also were increases in the desire for drugs at parties and in the frequencies of arrests for driving while intoxicated or under the influence and of poor academic performance. Adjusted prevalences of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use among students increased, while tobacco use decreased. Curriculum infusion, administrative response, and faculty and community activities most clearly were associated with favorable outcomes. Overall, however, FIPSE funding had limited short-term impact on AOD use and its consequences in higher education.

AB HIV infection rates are dramatically increasing in the Russian Federation. Epidemiological studies indicate that the greatest rise of HIV incidence has been among injection drug users (IDU). Young adults (N = 188) who reported injecting drug use completed surveys and interviews that assessed injection drug use behavior, sexual behavior, and HIV-related knowledge. The average age of participants was 21.3 years. Multiple linear regression analysis found male gender and younger age at sexual debut was positively and significantly associated with having multiple sexual partners. Gender moderated the effects of sexual debut and number of times injected drugs were used in the past month. Males who initiate sex at a younger age were more likely to report multiple sex partners and females who reported higher frequency of drug use were more likely to report multiple sex partners. Gender is an important factor, as well as moderator of risk behavior among Russian injection drug users. Delaying sexual debut, particularly for males, may be an effective strategy to reduce subsequent risk behavior. Prevention efforts among IDUs need to address sexual risk behavior in conjunction with injection risk behavior.

AB PURPOSE: To identify person, social group, and environmental factors associated with uptake of binge drinking among a national sample of college students.; METHODS: Using self-reported responses of students in the 1999 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study (CAS), we regressed conceptually important predictors of binge drinking onto a dichotomized variable describing uptake in the freshman year. This was a random sample of full-time undergraduates provided by the registrar at each participant school (n = 119). For this study, we analyzed data describing a subset of the total sample comprising first year students aged < or =19 years, excluding transfers (n = 1894). The student CAS is a 20-page voluntary, anonymous mailed questionnaire containing student reports about their alcohol and substance use, school activities, and background characteristics. Analyses included univariate and multivariate logistic regression adjusting for school response rate and using the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) in the Statistical Analysis Software package to handle the within-college clustering owing to the sampling scheme.; RESULTS: College students who reported that they were exposed to "wet" environments were more likely to engage in binge drinking than were their peers without similar exposures. Wet environments included social, residential, and market surroundings in which drinking is prevalent and alcohol cheap and easily accessed. Findings held up in multivariate analyses that included variables describing person and social group characteristics. Students who picked up binge drinking in college also were more likely than their peers to report inflated definitions of binge drinking and more permissive attitudes about appropriate ages for legal consumption.; CONCLUSIONS: Binge drinking can either be acquired or avoided in college among students who report they did not binge drink in high school. Reducing college binge uptake may require efforts to limit access/availability, control cheap prices, and maximize substance free environments and associations.

AB Childhood overweight is a significant and growing health problem in the US and other parts of the world. Secular trend data in the US suggest that children have become substantially heavier over the last several decades and that their risk for a number of health problems is increasing as a result. Defining obesity in children has been difficult as assessing body fat is expensive and impractical. Body mass index (BMI), derived from weight and height, is used as a surrogate indicator in adults. In children, the consensus is to use BMI percentiles statistically derived from a reference population. There is evidence that the prenatal, early childhood, and adolescent periods are critical in the development of obesity but the mechanisms involved are yet to be elucidated. The recent rapid increase in childhood overweight and obesity is attributed to the modern obesogenic environment. Changes in dietary constituents including higher derivation of energy from nutritionally poor and energy dense foods, increased sweetened drink consumption, larger portion sizes, and more frequent intake of food outside the home have been associated with poorer diets and higher weights. Further, physical activity has reduced with decreases in school physical education classes and organized sports, fewer opportunities to expend energy for daily living activity due to more mechanization, lower frequency of walking and biking, and greater use of sedentary activities for leisure. Television watching remains the most common activity for children. There are significant health outcomes associated with childhood obesity, including the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, and greater prevalence of various medical problems including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome, orthopedic problems, and pseudotumor cerebri. Of further concern is the increased risk for obesity in adulthood with its attendant co-morbidities. Interventions are imperative but not widely studied. The most effective interventions include comprehensive behavioral management, dietary modification, and exercise. Family-based interventions have been most successful at maintaining long-term weight loss. School-based interventions have the potential to significantly impact childhood overweight as large numbers of children can be reached. However, such programs require long-term follow-up and are expensive. Very low calorie diets, pharmacotherapy, and surgery remain experimental options for children. More recently, metformin has shown promise in promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity among adolescents. Combining multiple approaches for treatment, addressing obesity-promoting sociocultural practices and policies, and focusing on prevention strategies will be necessary to address this epidemic.

AB Wine production in Argentina left its mark in alcoholic drinks, placing it much closer to the socio cultural habits of the Mediterranean Europeans of the middle of the 20th century than to the Saxon peoples where the priority was consuming distilled drinks. During the last twenty years a very important economic investment accompanied the changes in the patterns of alcohol use, basically because of the incorporation of adolescent and preadolescent population into the alcoholic drinks market. If the traditional permissive standard, which accepted the enjoyment of alcohol, was modified in the elements of culture that tended to set limits to its excess, evolution has leaned towards a culture that extends tolerance to excess, frequently referred to as an uncontrolled state. It is a change, which weighs even heavier upon those who are more vulnerable. Up to now although this has been evident in educational and economic areas, it can also be supported by other new factors. Historically, the focus of social concern has concentrated on those cases with alcohol dependence, as exemplified by the abstinence syndrome. The cultural trivialization of 'non addictive' levels of consumption, is sustained only by social tolerance. Preventive strategies must establish a system of alarm signals that target early detection, and as a result prompt attention. The variety of methods within the field of rehabilitation, in contrast to the scarce development in the secondary level, offers a sign of considerable bias in health policies. This is true both in the design of preventive programmes as well as in the training and organisation of support resources.

AB AIMS: A major question in national substance use prevention efforts is how much influence parents have on their children's substance use, answers to which could determine whether current school-based prevention programs that address peer pressure are sufficient or whether parents need to be involved. The present study examines whether parents act as gatekeepers by testing the moderator effects of parents' substance use on the relationships of friends' substance use to adolescent substance use (cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana).; DESIGN: A longitudinal school-based trial for prevention of substance use in adolescents.; SETTING: Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; PARTICIPANTS: As part of a large substance use prevention trial, entering middle school students were surveyed prospectively at baseline, 6 months and 18 months (n = 1807 from 57 schools).; MEASUREMENTS: A self-reported survey was used to measure behaviors, attitudes and social influences related to adolescent substance use.; FINDINGS: Results of logistic regression analyses and multiple group structural equation modeling showed that increasing numbers of parents and friends using substances were associated with greater risk of adolescent substance use, as were more substance offers and lower levels of refusal self-efficacy. Additionally, refusal self-efficacy mediated the effects of baseline use and substance offers on subsequent use. However, non-using parents had a buffering effect on friends' influences to use substances, such that friends' use did not affect adolescent use when parents were non-users, and the effects of substance offers on refusal self-efficacy were weaker.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that parent substance use should be addressed in adolescent substance use prevention programs, and that continuing non-use by parents should be reinforced.

The prevalence of heavy alcohol use (typically consuming five or more drinks in a row for males/four or more for females) among past-year and past-week drinkers is significantly higher among US students than Canadian students (41% versus 35%, 54% versus 42%). In both countries older [corrected] students and students living at home with their parents are less likely to be heavy drinkers; students who report first drunkenness before the age of 16 are more likely to be heavy drinkers in college.; CONCLUSION: Programs aimed at students' heavy alcohol use should target freshman at entry or earlier. Since students living with their parents are less likely to be heavy drinkers, parents may play a potentially important role in prevention efforts. The patterns of drinking in both countries may be influenced by the legal minimum drinking age. However, the relationship is complex and must be viewed in the context of other variables such as chronological age.

PY 2002

AB A "behavioral vaccine" provides an inoculation against morbidity or mortality, impacting physical, mental, or behavior disorders. An historical example of a behavioral vaccine is antiseptic hand washing to reduce childbed fever. In current society, issues with high levels of morbidity, such as substance abuse, delinquency, youth violence, and other behavioral disorders (multiproblems), cry out for a low-cost, widespread strategy as simple as antiseptic hand washing. Congruent research findings from longitudinal studies, twin studies, and other investigations suggest that a possibility might exist for a behavioral vaccine for multiproblem behavior. A simple behavioral strategy called the Good Behavior Game (GBG), which reinforces inhibition in a group context of elementary school, has substantial previous research to consider its use as a behavioral vaccine. The GBG is not a curriculum but rather a simple behavioral procedure from applied behavior analysis. Approximately 20 independent replications of the GBG across different grade levels, different types of students, different settings, and some with long-term follow-up show strong, consistent impact on impulsive, disruptive behaviors of children and teens as well as reductions in substance use or serious antisocial behaviors. The GBG, named as a "best practice" for the prevention of substance abuse or violent behavior by a number of federal agencies, is unique because it is the only practice implemented by individual teachers that is documented to have long-term effects. Presently, the GBG is only used in a small number of settings. However, near universal use of the GBG, in major political jurisdictions during the elementary years, could substantially reduce the incidence of substance use, antisocial behavior, and other adverse developmental or social consequences at a very modest cost, with very positive cost-effectiveness ratios.

AB OBJECTIVE: We assessed the prevalence of HIV infection and associated risk behaviors among street-recruited young injection drug users (IDUs) in San Francisco.; METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 304 young (age <30 years) IDUs with a history of injecting in the previous 30 days were interviewed and tested for antibodies to HIV. Analyses assessing independent associations with HIV infection were limited to males only, due to the low number of infections in women.; RESULTS: The prevalence of HIV infection was 5.3% overall but was highly stratified by gender and sexual preference (15.6% among homosexual/bisexual men vs. heterosexual men) and recruitment neighborhood (18% in the Polk Street area). Of 16 HIV infections, 14 (88%) were in males. Factors independently associated with HIV infection in males included sexual preference (homosexual/bisexual vs. heterosexual: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-36.6), recruitment neighborhood (Polk Street neighborhood vs. other neighborhoods: AOR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.4-16.7), and duration of residence in San Francisco (>or=1 year vs. <1 year: AOR, 11.8; 95% CI, 1.4-95.8).; CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV infection was highest among male IDUs who have sex with men. The strong associations between HIV infection and sexual orientation and HIV infection and recruitment locale suggest that risk may be attributable largely to sexual risk. In addition to successful prevention efforts aimed at reducing needle-associated risk, current intervention models aimed at young IDUs should target high-risk neighborhoods and emphasize sexual risk reduction measures, in particular among men who have sex with men.

AB AIMS: The estimation of alcohol-related human losses in Russia in the 1980s and 1990s.; DESIGN: The estimation was made by comparing changes in the total number of deaths and in specific categories, and alcohol consumption in Russia during this time.; SETTING: The anti-alcohol campaign, launched in 1985, and the market reforms launched in 1992 were associated with large and rapid changes of alcohol-consumption in Russia.; FINDINGS: In the early 1980s, the aggregate number of direct and indirect alcohol-related life losses was more than 500,000 per annum, or 32% of total deaths. Half of the alcohol-related human losses in Russia over the period studied were due to accidents, poisoning and violence. Following the anti-alcohol campaign and reduction in annual per capita alcohol consumption from 14.2 (1984) to 10.5 l (1986), mortality decreased from 1161.6 to 1054.0 per 100,000 of the population. It is estimated that from 1986 to 1991 the lives of 1.22 million people were spared; that is, 11.4% of the number of deaths expected without the anti-alcohol campaign. All categories of deaths were reduced with the exception of neoplasms, infectious and parasitic diseases. In the period of the so-called market reforms both alcohol consumption and mortality increased sharply. The total number of alcohol-related deaths for 1994 was 751,000 in the population, or 33% of all deaths (direct and indirect losses). In 1995 alcohol consumption started to decrease. A decrease in mortality was registered despite the sharp deterioration of the quality of life in the country. However, a new growth of total mortality, fatal alcohol poisonings and number of alcohol psychoses began in 1999-2000.; CONCLUSION: The results of this study show the enormous scale of alcohol-related mortality in Russia. It has been revealed that alcohol-related deaths are at the top of the hierarchy of all premature deaths in the country. Decreasing alcohol consumption is an important means of decreasing total mortality in Russia.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify developmental trajectories of drinking between the ages of 18 and 26 years and to identify variables, amenable to policy influence, which predict these trajectories.; DESIGN: Longitudinal data were analysed using latent class mixture modelling.; SETTING: Participants were interviewed in a central location.; PARTICIPANTS: Provincial city birth cohort, cross-national studies suggest findings are generalizable to other similar market economies.; MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of drinking over the past year and the typical quantity consumed per drinking occasion were computed from five location-specific questions. Measures used to predict membership of trajectory groups were ease of access to alcohol, drinking on licensed premises, response to alcohol advertising, educational achievement, parental consumption, age of onset of regular drinking and living arrangements.; RESULTS: Three trajectories of quantities consumed showed reduced consumption after age 21 but one trajectory showed marked increases. Three trajectories of frequency of drinking increased or remained stable over time. Access to licensed premises at age 18 had the most significant impact on membership of the trajectory groups and educational achievement had a significant impact on membership of the heavier quantity trajectory groups. Parental alcohol consumption, access to alcohol at 15 years, liking for alcohol advertising, living arrangement and age of onset of regular drinking also influenced trajectory membership.; CONCLUSIONS: Quantity and frequency of drinking in adolescence and early adulthood had different trajectories. Membership of heavier drinking groups was affected by environmental influences which are subject to policy change, particularly that of earlier access to licensed premises. In a small group high-quantity consumption did not decrease at age 26.

Respondents felt that information on certain areas of HIV/AIDS/STIs was much needed. Health care workers were perceived to see a high need for information and services generally. Religious and community leaders were perceived to see less need for some information and services (such as condom promotion, sex education for young people). All groups were perceived to see a need for education and services for people living with AIDS and drug users. Television and radio were considered the best channels for health education while training was seen as the most effective method for information exchange.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review the current state of knowledge of psychiatric comorbidity in adolescent cigarette smokers.; METHOD: assisted literature search was conducted and seminal articles were cross-referenced for comprehensiveness of the search. For each disorder, a synopsis of knowledge in adults is provided and compared with the knowledge in adolescents.; RESULTS: Psychiatric comorbidity is common in adolescent cigarette smokers, especially disruptive behavior disorders (such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), major depressive disorders, and drug and alcohol use disorders. Anxiety disorders are modestly associated with cigarette smoking. Both early onset (<13 years) cigarette smoking and conduct problems seem to be robust markers of increased psychopathology, including substance abuse, later in life. In spite of the high comorbidity, very few adolescents have nicotine dependence diagnosed or receive smoking cessation treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric treatment settings.; CONCLUSIONS: There is increasing evidence for high rates of psychiatric comorbidity in adolescent cigarette smokers. Cigarette smoking in adolescence appears to be a strong marker of future psychopathology. Child and adolescent psychiatry treatment programs may be a good setting for prevention efforts and treatment, which should focus on both nicotine dependence and psychiatric disorders.

AB This article focuses on consumer reactions during and after the Coca-Cola crisis of June 1999 in Belgium. The research tests for associations between the personality trait "emotional stability," attitude toward the brand, and self-reported behavior. Cross-sectional data are collected from a sample of Coca-Cola drinkers between 19 and 22 years old. The data are analyzed through the specification and estimation of a structural equation model and ANOVA. A direct and positive effect of attitude toward the brand on the behavioral response is found. No direct effect of emotional stability on behavior is revealed. However, indirect effects of personality mediated by attitude are discovered. Further, emotional stability is found to correlate negatively with importance attached to information during the crisis. Fast and transparent communication with specific attention to lower emotional stability groups, as well as the inclusion of personality and attitude measurements in future health and food safety studies, are recommended.

AB BACKGROUND: Various studies support the concept of an inherited vulnerability to drug dependency, while emphasizing the importance of social and environmental influences and their interactions.; OBJECTIVES: To compare the characteristics of heroin-dependent Jewish men in Israel with those of the general population, focusing on the nature of family history of substance abuse.; METHOD: This case-control study compares 64 heroin-dependent Jewish male residents of Jerusalem with a community sample of 131 randomly selected Jerusalem residents with no drug use disorder. Univariate and multivariate models were employed to appraise the independent associations between heroin dependence and exposure variables such as family history of substance misuse and exposure to legal psychoactive substances.; RESULTS: The case group is characterized by heavy tobacco and alcohol involvement. Nearly 70% of the cases report an alcohol and/or drug problem in at least one first-degree relative compared with 10% of controls (odds ratio 14.5, adjusted for sociodemographic and other potential confounders). Cases with a positive family history have, on average, higher alcohol consumption levels and higher heroin-use severity scores, as compared with cases with no such history.; CONCLUSIONS: Familial aggregation of drug and alcohol problems, along with smoking at a young age, is the strongest predictor of heroin dependence in this population. Better understanding of the components underlying this familial aggregation can lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Television is a source from which children gain information about life and experience different types of behavior. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) has not been used thoroughly to evaluate the behavioral effects of television viewing on children.; OBJECTIVE: To examine the competency and problem behavior correlates of television viewing in school-aged children using the CBCL.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: Two randomly selected grade schools, one from a high-income district and the other from a low-income district.; PARTICIPANTS: Students in grades 2 and 3 and their parents.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A questionnaire on children's time spent watching television and engaging in other daily activities and the CBCL were sent to the parents of 888 second- and third-grade students.; RESULTS: Results of the questionnaire reported that the overall mean +/- SD daily television viewing time was 2.5 +/- 1.3 hours. Overall television viewing time had a negative correlation with social and school achievement (r = -0.17, P<.001 and r = 0.11, P =.03, respectively) subscale scores. Withdrawn (r = 0.11, P =.004), social problem (r = 0.14, P =.001), thought problem (r = 0.11, P =.03), attention problem (r = 0.20, P<.001), delinquent behavior (r = 0.12, P<.001), aggressive behavior (r = 0.22, P<.001), and externalization (r = 0.19, P<.001) subscales and total problem (r = 0.15, P<.001) scores were positively correlated with time spent watching television. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that the only significant variables associated with a risk of watching television for more than 2 hours were age, gender, social subscale, and attention problem subscale scores of the CBCL.; CONCLUSION: As evaluated by the CBCL, television viewing time is positively associated with social problems, delinquent behavior, aggressive behavior, externalization, and total problem scores. Older age, male gender, and decreasing social subscale and increasing attention problem subscale scores on the CBCL increases the risk of watching television for more than 2 hours.

AB Some drinks containing natural products with stimulant properties are highly consumed among young adults. The market for these drinks has increased in past years around the globe, and, although they might be harmless, overdoses or combination of these with other drinks could be harmful to the health of some consumers in certain circumstances. Samples were obtained at food shops and different popular brands were chosen. Cytotoxicity tests used were neutral red uptake, total protein content, and tetrazolium assay on Chinese hamster ovary cells. Results revealed that tested samples were not cytotoxic; however, studies have demonstrated the toxicity of high concentrations of some of these products. For this reason, the authors considered it to be of critical importance to carryout an in vitro toxicity screening of stimulant soft drinks that are highly consumed.

AB The portrayal of violence, sex, and drugs/alcohol in the media has been known to adversely affect the behavior of children and adolescents. There is a strong association between perceptions of media messages and observed behavior, especially with children. Lately, there has been more of a focus in the public health/medical field on media influences of youth and the role of the pediatrician and/or healthcare worker in addressing this area of growing concern. There is a need to explicitly explore the influences of media violence, sex, and drugs/alcohol on youth within the context of the Social Learning Theory. Implications of these influences are discussed, and recommendations for pediatricians and/or health care workers who interact with children and adolescents are described. Pediatricians and health care workers should incorporate media exposure probes into the developmental history of their patients and become knowledgeable about the effects of medial influences on youth.

AB We examined heritability of error rate on the antisaccade task among female twin youths. This task appears to be sensitive to prefrontal functioning, providing a measure of individual differences in inhibitory control associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia. The sample consisted of 674 11-year-olds and 616 17-year-olds, comprising the two cohorts of female twins from the Minnesota Twin Family Study, a population-based investigation of substance abuse and related psychopathology. We used biometric model-fitting methods to determine the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on performance. In both age cohorts, the best fitting model contained additive genes and nonshared environment. Despite substantial age-related differences in mean performance levels (effect size = .81), additive genes accounted for greater than half the variance in performance in both age cohorts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that antisaccade error rate might serve as an endophenotype for behavior disorders reflecting frontal lobe dysfunction or problems with inhibitory control.

AB BACKGROUND: Adolescents are at high risk of sexually transmitted disease (STD)/HIV infection, and one vulnerable subgroup is African American females. The association between adolescents' previous experience of STD and recent sexual risk behaviors has been ill-defined.; GOAL: The goal was to examine the associations between adolescents' self-reported history of STD diagnosis and current sexual risk behaviors, prevention knowledge and attitudes, and STD infection status.; STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional survey. Recruitment sites were in low-income neighborhoods of Birmingham, Alabama, characterized by high rates of unemployment, substance abuse, violence, and STDs. Participants were sexually active adolescent females (N = 522) 14 to 18 years of age. Information on STD history and current sexual behaviors (within the 30 days before assessment) was collected in face-to-face interviews. Less sensitive topics, such as STD prevention knowledge, attitudes about condom use, and perceived barriers to condom use, were addressed via self-administered survey. DNA amplification of vaginal swab specimens provided by the adolescents was performed to determine current STD status. Outcomes associated with past STD diagnosis were determined by means of logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) in the presence of observed covariates.; RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of adolescents reported ever having an STD diagnosed. Although past STD diagnosis was associated with increased STD prevention knowledge, it was not associated with increased motivation to use condoms. Compared with adolescents who had never had an STD, adolescents with a history of diagnosed STD were more likely to report not using a condom at most recent intercourse (AOR = 2.54; 95% CI = 1.64-3.93; = 0.0001), recent unprotected vaginal intercourse (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.15-2.79; = 0.010), inconsistent condom use (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.46-3.51; < .0001), sexual intercourse while drinking alcohol (AOR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.33-3.28; = 0.001), and unprotected intercourse with multiple partners (AOR = 3.29; 95% CI = 1.09-9.89; = 0.034). Past STD diagnosis was associated with increased risk for current biologically confirmed gonorrhea and trichomoniasis (AOR = 2.48; 95% CI = 1.09-5.23; = 0.030; and AOR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.18-3.59; = 0.011, respectively). Past STD diagnosis was not significantly associated with increased risk of current biologically confirmed chlamydia (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.45-1.37; = 0.38).; CONCLUSION: Among this sample of female adolescents, past STD diagnosis was an indicator of current high-risk sexual activity and increased risk for two common STDs: gonorrhea and trichomoniasis. Although adolescents may gain factual knowledge from the experience of having an STD diagnosed, they are not applying that knowledge to their current sexual behaviors. Thus, these adolescents remain at risk for subsequent STD infection. Therefore, the findings suggest that there is a need to intensify clinic-based prevention efforts directed toward adolescents with a history of STDs, as a strategy for reducing STD-associated risk behaviors and, consequently, the likelihood of new STD infections.

AB There is no single "best" prevention program, and no one program or approach will stop all drug use. There are many effective research-based programs; the best approach for any particular population requires selecting the best intervention for the target population on the basis of a knowledge of the risk and protective factors in that population. Unfortunately, the most highly marketed school or family programs are generally not those programs with the best outcomes. The best approach to prevention is to begin early to reduce emerging behavioral and emotional problems in youth. Longer-lasting effects should accrue from changing school, community, and family environmental conditions that promote and maintain drug problems in youth. More and more prevention specialists are considering moving from a focus on the individual to changes in total systems or the environmental contexts that promote or hinder drug use. On the basis of economic considerations, the "whole family" systems-change approach of family skills training classes is becoming popular even in the managed care environment. The greatest challenge facing the drug abuse prevention field is to get information out to practitioners and communities about the best prevention programs, approaches, and principles of effectiveness. Researchers and funding agencies must learn how to effectively market the most successful programs to bridge the gap between research and practice. We must become as effective at marketing drug prevention programs as drug dealers are at promoting and selling drugs. Communities need health care professionals who are knowledgeable about substance abuse prevention and who can advocate the implementation and ongoing improvement of prevention programs with known effectiveness.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine what young people think about the tobacco company Philip Morris and how it affects their evaluations of the company's new television advertising.; DESIGN: Data were gathered in the context of a controlled experiment in which participants saw four Philip Morris ads about youth smoking prevention, four Philip Morris ads about charitable works, or four Anheuser-Busch ads about preventing underage drinking (the control group). Knowledge and opinion of Philip Morris were measured before ad exposure.; SETTING: A California state university in the San Francisco Bay area.; SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of undergraduates (n = 218) aged 18-25 years.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Advertising evaluation measured by 12 semantic differential scales.; RESULTS: A little more than half of the students knew that Philip Morris is a tobacco company. Neither this knowledge nor students' smoking status was related to their opinion of the company. Philip Morris ads were rated less favourably by students who were aware that the sponsor is a tobacco company than by students who were unaware.; CONCLUSIONS: Advertisements designed to discredit the tobacco industry typically avoid references to specific companies. This study suggests that such counter-advertising would benefit from teaching audiences about the industry's corporate identities.

AB The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviors and drug-using behaviors in a large community sample of male and female injection drug users (IDUs) in St. Petersburg, Russia. This investigation used a data collection plan that systematically recruited a drug user sample from venues where IDUs were known to congregate and could be accessed. Surveys were completed by 239 IDUs (males = 139, females = 100), aged 13-25. Participants averaged 44 injections (range = 0-240) in the past 30 days, with heroin (70%) and heroin plus other drugs (20%) the most frequently used. Participants' mean age of first drug injecting was 17.6 years, 41% of participants regularly shared needles, most had multiple sexual partners (mean = 9.3 partners in the past 3 months), and 70% reported engaging in vaginal intercourse without condoms. Stepwise logistic regression showed that high-risk sexual behavior was predicted by being female, young, using heroin several times a month, and less negative attitudes toward using condoms. Effective HIV prevention efforts for IDUs in Russia must be tailored to their age, gender, drug use, and condom attitudes. These programs will also have to address the dual risk factors, unique to IDUs, of risky sexual behaviors and needle sharing. Without a rapid intervention response, Russia's HIV/AIDS crisis will soon turn catastrophic.

AB BACKGROUND: Multiple risk behavior plays an important role in the social etiology of youth injury, yet the consistency of this observation has not been examined multinationally.; OBJECTIVE: To examine reports from young people in 12 countries, by country, age group, sex, and injury type, to quantify the strength and consistency of this association.; SETTING: World Health Organization collaborative cross-national survey of health behavior in school-aged children.; PARTICIPANTS: A multinational representative sample of 49 461 students aged 11, 13, and 15 years.; MAIN EXPOSURE MEASURES: Additive score consisting of counts of self-reported health risk behaviors: smoking, drinking, nonuse of seat belts, bullying, excess time with friends, alienation at school and from parents, truancy, and an unusually poor diet.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-report of a medically treated injury.; RESULTS: Strong gradients in risk for injury were observed according to the numbers of risk behaviors reported. Overall, youth reporting the largest number (> or =5 health risk behaviors) experienced injury rates that were 2.46 times higher (95% confidence interval, 2.27-2.67) than those reporting no risk behaviors (adjusted odds ratios for 0 to > or =5 reported behaviors: 1.00, 1.22, 1.48, 1.73, 1.98, and 2.46, respectively; P<.001 for trend). Similar gradients in risk for injury were observed among youth in all 12 countries and within all demographic subgroups. Risk gradients were especially pronounced for nonsports, fighting-related, and severe injuries.; CONCLUSIONS: Gradients in risk for youth injury increased in association with numbers of risk behaviors reported in every country examined. This cross-cultural finding indicates that the issue of multiple risk behavior, as assessed via an additive score, merits attention as an etiological construct. This concept may be useful in future injury control research and prevention efforts conducted among populations of young people.

AB Immigrant parents and their U.S.-born children may experience stressful family conflicts over the disparate sociocultural norms of the United States and their country of origin. Such stresses may heighten adolescents' vulnerability to drug abuse. This article documents the extent of drug use in a sample of 200 U.S.-born Asian Indian adolescents. According to the study participants' self-reports on lifetime use, 28 percent had used alcohol on at least one occasion, 16.5 percent had used cigarettes, and 2.5 percent had used marijuana. Adolescents who placed importance on their parents' drug abuse prevention messages tended not to use drugs. The implications of the study's findings for drug abuse assessment, treatment, and prevention are discussed.

AB This is a study of the secondhand effects of student alcohol use experienced by residents of neighborhoods near college campuses. We examined the relationship of a college's level of binge drinking and the number of alcohol outlets in the immediate area, to lowered quality of neighborhood life through such secondhand effects. Adults from 4661 households in the United States were interviewed through a stratified list-assisted random digit dialing telephone survey. The interview schedule included questions about residents' experiences of secondhand effects of alcohol use such as noise, vandalism or public disturbances. Reports about the quality of neighborhood life provided by respondents residing near colleges were compared with those of respondents who did not live near colleges; and reports of neighbors of colleges with high rates of binge drinking were compared with those of neighbors of colleges with lower rates. The presence of alcohol outlets in these areas was also compared. Residents near colleges and particularly near colleges with heavy episodic drinking reported the presence of more alcohol outlets within a mile. Those neighborhoods were characterized by lower socioeconomic status. Neighbors living near college campuses were more likely to report a lowered quality of neighborhood life through such secondhand effects of heavy alcohol use as noise and disturbances, vandalism, drunkenness, vomiting and urination. A path analysis indicated that the number of nearby alcohol outlets was an important factor mediating the relationship between colleges, especially those with high rates of binge drinking, and such secondhand effects. The results suggest that neighborhood disruptions around colleges due to heavy alcohol use may be reduced by limiting the presence of alcohol outlets in those areas, and the marketing practices that this engenders.

AB This paper describes the types of, and circumstances surrounding, unintentional farm-related fatal injuries involving young and older adults in Australia. Information was obtained from an inspection of coronial files for the period 1989-1992. Around 14% of all farm-related fatalities in Australia during 1989-1992 were of young adults aged 15-24 years and approximately one-quarter were of older adults aged > or = 55 years. Young adults were commonly fatally injured in motor vehicle incidents and in incidents involving firearms. Tractors were the most common agent involved in fatal incidents involving older adults. Intervention measures to prevent fatalities of older adults in agriculture should focus on the safe use of tractors, while for young adults it appears prevention efforts should centre around safe use of firearms and operation of motor vehicles on the farm. Ways to overcome barriers to the use of injury prevention measures in rural Australia should be further explored.

AB PURPOSE: To examine the current prevalence of disordered eating behaviors in a large sample of adolescents, by gender and ethnicity, and to identify gender and ethnic-specific risk and protective factors.; METHODS: The study population included 81,247 9th- and 12th-graders who completed the 1998 Minnesota Student Survey, a self-report, school-based survey which included questions about disordered eating behaviors and a variety of psychosocial characteristics.; RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of 9th-grade females and 28% of 9th-grade males report disordered eating behaviors (i.e. one or more of the following to lose or control weight: fasting or skipping meals, diet pills, vomiting, laxatives or smoking cigarettes; and binge-eating), with slightly higher rates among 12th-grade females and males, 57% and 31%, respectively. Among both genders, Hispanic and American Indian youth reported the highest prevalence of disordered eating. Risk factors for disordered eating among both males and females included cigarette smoking, appearance concerns, and alcohol use. Protective factors for both males and females were positive self-esteem, emotional well-being, school achievement, and family connectedness. While risk and protective factors were similar across gender, they differed across ethnicity particularly among females.; CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals working with youth need to be aware of the high prevalence of these subclinical disordered eating behaviors, ask appropriate screening questions, and provide resources and referral, if necessary, for youth reporting these behaviors. Knowledge of risk and protective factors can serve to guide intervention and prevention efforts, particularly as they apply across ethnicity.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between beginning to binge-eat or purge, beginning to smoke, and getting drunk for the first time.; METHOD: Prospective study of 11,358 girls and boys, 10 to 15 years of age, in an ongoing cohort study who completed questionnaires in 1997 and 1998. The outcome measures were beginning to engage in bulimic behaviors, beginning to smoke, and getting drunk for the first time between 1997 and 1998.; RESULTS: During 1 year, 4.3% of girls and 3.8% of boys started smoking, 5.3% of girls and 4.8% of boys started getting drunk, and 2.4% of girls and 0.8% of boys started engaging in bulimic behaviors. Among the girls, weight concerns in 1997 were predictive of beginning to smoke (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2), get drunk (OR = 1.7), purge (OR = 3.8), and binge-eat (OR = 2.6). Adolescents who reported smoking in 1997 were more likely than nonsmokers to get drunk for the first time (girls: OR = 5.7; boys: OR = 7.1). The reverse association, getting drunk as a predictor of starting to smoke, was of lesser magnitude (OR = 2.3-2.6).; CONCLUSIONS: The three unhealthy behaviors were associated prospectively with each other. The results suggest that prevention efforts should target weight concerns and multiple risk behaviors.

AB This descriptive study was designed to assess coping strategies of female adolescents infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (N = 30). Results from the Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences Questionnaire (ACOPES) revealed that the most often utilized coping strategies identified by the adolescents were: listening to music, thinking about good things, making your own decisions, being close to someone you care about, sleeping, trying on your own to deal with problems, eating, watching television, daydreaming and praying. The adolescents also reported low utilization of certain maladaptive coping strategies such as alcohol and illicit drug usage. Chronic illnesses such as HIV, cancer and diabetes are difficult for adolescents because of the unique developmental tasks needed to understand the psychological and social impact caused by chronic illnesses. The research presented illustrates the complexities of stress and the effects of coping on psychological well-being, health behavior, and health. This research explores specific coping strategies used by HIV-infected adolescents. Findings provided baseline data of the various coping strategies of female adolescents infected with HIV in an outpatient setting. These findings may serve as a foundation for future studies on coping strategies among females infected with HIV. Furthermore, the findings may also be useful in developing an outpatient behavior-modification/coping effectiveness training program that is both gender-specific and culturally appropriate.

AB Substance use by adolescents can lead to mortality, physical and social morbidity, and a brain disorder called substance dependence if allowed to progress to chronic, repetitive self-administration. Substance abuse and dependence can begin in adolescence or adulthood, but many of the attitudes and behaviors that affect risk become established during adolescence. Genetic risk factors have been identified for at least two distinct disorders and more are under active study to determine the cause and pathophysiology of addictive disorders. Although much remains to be done, a complex interplay of numerous genetic and environmental risk factors clearly is involved. An understanding of the most important environmental risk factors has led to effective primary prevention approaches; knowledge of the genetic risk factors and neuropharmacology of drugs of abuse in the brain is beginning to influence secondary prevention efforts and treatment, including better medications for addictive disorders. A large proportion of adolescents carry a genetic vulnerability that can be expressed when they accept peer and societal influences that promote experimentation with substances of abuse. At that point, the genetic factors take over, maintaining the drug self-administration pattern. Decay of social status results from association with drug-using peers and shifts in priorities supportive of drug use rather than education and productivity. More research into the genetic risk factors and applications of current knowledge to treatment is needed.

AB The dollar value of an illicit drug market is an important statistic in drug policy analysis. It can be used to illustrate the scale of the trade in a drug; evaluate its impact on a local community or nation; provide an indication of the level of criminality related to a drug; and can inform discussions of future drug policy options. This paper calculates the first ever demand side estimates of the New Zealand cannabis black market. The estimates produced are calculated using cannabis consumption data from the Alcohol & Public Health Research Unit's (APHRU) 1998 National Drug Survey. The wholesale value of the market is estimated to be 81.3-104.6 million dollars a year, and the retail value of the market is estimated to be 131.3-168.9 million dollars a year. These demand side estimates are much lower than the existing supply side estimates of the market calculated using police seizures of cannabis plants. The retail figure is four times lower than the lowest national supply side estimate (636 million dollars) and seven times lower than the highest national supply side estimate (1.27 billion dollars). The demand side estimates suggest a much smaller cannabis economy to fuel organized criminal activity in New Zealand than previous estimates implied.

AB OBJECTIVES: To compare personal and situational influences on incidents involving drink driving with those involving sober driving.; METHODS: Information on a range of road safety practices was sought in face to face interviews conducted with 969 members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study cohort at age 26 years. A total of 750 study members reported an incident that involved the opportunity to consume alcohol and also travel by motor vehicle. Of these, 87 were classified as "drink drive incidents" and 663 as "sober drive incidents".; RESULTS: Study members who were male, of lower socioeconomic status, had no school qualifications, or were dependent on alcohol or marijuana at age 21 were significantly more likely to report a drink drive incident at age 26. Compared with the sober drive incidents, the drink drive incidents were more commonly associated with driving alone, drinking at bars, and no advanced planning. For drink drive incidents the amount of alcohol consumed was influenced by the conviviality of the occasion, whereas for sober drive incidents it was the need to drive. One quarter of those reporting drink drive incidents stated they had used marijuana and/or LSD at the event at which they drank.; CONCLUSIONS: Drink drive and sober drive incidents differed, particularly with regard to decisions made before the event. Prevention efforts could usefully be targeted toward these decisions.

AB Previous research of addictive substances suggests that use of alcohol, illicit drugs, and tobacco is overrepresented on prime-time television (TV). These studies, however, have relied on frequency counts of the substance, rather than the prevalence of use among characters. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence of alcohol, illicit drug, and tobacco users among characters on prime-time TV during 1995 and 1996 with rates of use in the United States. In addition, we determined if the ratio of male to female, young to old, and white to minority addictive substance users on prime-time TV were similar to the equivalent U.S. ratios. Comparing results for prime-time TV characters versus the U.S. population (respectively), 11.0% (99% CI, 9.8-12.1) drank alcohol versus 51.0%; 0.8% (99% CI, 0.5-1.1) used illicit drugs versus 6.1%; and 2.5% (99% CI, 2.0-3.1) smoked tobacco versus 28.9%. In addition, no consistent pattern was evident in our analyses that assessed whether addictive substance users on prime-time TV were more frequently represented as men, young, or minority compared to the similar U.S. ratio. These results indicate that contrary to prevailing beliefs, alcohol, illicit drug, and tobacco users are uncommon on prime-time TV and are less prevalent than in the U.S. population.

AB Trend analyses of the U.S. monitoring data systems (the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the Monitoring the Future Study) and of the country's surveillance program, the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG), indicate that several new "drug abuse" patterns have emerged over the past several years. For adolescents, drug use rates are converging for females and males, the mean age at which youngsters initiate drug use has declined, and more young adolescents are reporting using drugs. Furthermore, emergent new drug use patterns are being observed by the CEWG. The use of drugs such as Rohypnol, the injecting of crack-cocaine, and the spread of methamphetamines by new traffickers challenge our existing knowledge and understanding of drug use and its prevention. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has funded several large longitudinal studies that follow selected children and adolescents into their twenties, and some into their thirties. This research has been a rich source of information on the determinants of initiating and continuing drug abuse. Yet the findings from the surveys have not been well explored by the longitudinal studies, nor have the findings from the longitudinal studies been used in the surveys to better understand the observed changing trends in drug use patterns. This paper addresses six issues that have been observed from the findings from analyses of data from the surveys or macroepidemiologic studies. Information from the sub-population or micro-epidemiologic studies are reviewed for possible hypotheses to explain each issue. Suggestions for further research and implications for prevention also are presented.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the use of contraceptives in Sweden.; METHODS: Analysis of the population-based survey 'Sex in Sweden. On the Swedish sexual life 1996'. The survey was analyzed in relation to socio-demographic, lifestyle, sexual and behavioral characteristics as well as attitudes to, and evaluation of, personal experiences. The data included 2810 men and women between 18 and 74 years of age. The results were compared with a similar survey carried out in 1967.; RESULTS: During the 30-year period between the 1967 and 1996 surveys, condom use more than halved and use of oral contraceptives increased by 6 percentage points. The decline in the use of condoms did not occur among teenagers but among all other age groups in both men and women. In 1996 the majority (72%) used a reliable contraceptive method, but 29% did not. Coitus-dependent methods were more frequently used by men and women who were below the age of 21, smoked, used alcohol simultaneously with coitus, had casual partners, were more highly educated, were breastfeeding, had coitus less frequently and among those who were most satisfied with their sexual life and their partner relationship.; CONCLUSION: In order to increase the use of more reliable contraceptive methods, three crucial factors should be focused on in counselling and media campaigns: gender, age and the use of coitus-dependent/coitus-independent methods.

AB AIMS: Despite widespread prevention efforts to decrease adolescent risk-taking, substance use and driving after drinking (DD) are prevalent in the United States. The current study compared the efficacy of an abbreviated version of Drug Abuse and Resistance Education (DARE-A) to a new Risk Skills Training Program (RSTP).; DESIGN: Adolescent participation in drinking, drug use, DD and riding with a drunk driver was examined longitudinally. After baseline assessments, adolescents were randomly assigned to the RSTP. DARE-A or a no intervention control group and then completed 2-month post-test and 6-month follow-up assessments.; SETTING: Adolescents attended a mid-sized suburban high school.; PARTICIPANTS: The sample (N = 300) was comprised of 58% females and the age range was 14-19 years.; INTERVENTION: The RSTP was developed to target several risk behaviors and to examine the feasibility of conducting a brief personalized prevention program in a group setting. DARE-A focused on increasing knowledge and understanding the deleterious effects of substance use.; MEASUREMENTS: Risk-taking behavior, perception of peer risk-taking and positive and negative alcohol expectancies were assessed.; FINDINGS: RSTP participants decreased participation in several risk behaviors at post-test, but reductions were not maintained at 6-month follow-up. The control and DARE-A groups increased their positive and decreased their negative alcohol expectancies. The control group increased their alcohol consumption.; CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a brief, personalized, group prevention program is a feasible approach to reducing adolescent risk-taking. Strategies must be developed to solidify these positive changes so that they are longer-lasting.

Initial drugs were frequently administered through sniffing/snorting (55%) and smoking cigarettes mixed with a drug (38%). First drug use occurred most commonly at a friend's home (65%) and in the company of other drug users (83%). Drugs were generally provided free for first-time use by other drug users (72%). Reasons for first drug use included experimentation (90%), being lured into drugs by other people (44%) and relaxation (42%). Most drug users had a history of regular cigarette smoking (89%), alcohol consumption (49%) and deviant behaviors (51%) prior to their drug initiation. The majority perceived that their friends (90%) and neighbors (88%) used illicit drugs.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings are similar to studies in western countries with respect to the pattern and correlates of illicit drug initiation, and underscore the need for drug prevention efforts in China.

Students were in the seventh grade at pretest (N = 4,776). The smoking intervention included posters, booklets, classroom activities, debates, and a signature campaign. The family intervention involved home activities. The survey measured tobacco knowledge, attitudes, offers, use, and intentions.; RESULTS: Intervention students were significantly less likely than controls to have been offered, received, experimented with, or have intentions to use tobacco.; CONCLUSION: The project had a significant impact on tobacco use.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of learning disorders, defined as repeating a year, in adolescents and associated social and health risk factors.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study of a cohort of 14-year-olds was performed. Data (medical, social and family history and anthropometric data) were collected by pediatricians and a self-administered questionnaire on school progress, health-related self-image, physical activity, leisure-time activities, family and social relationships, drug and alcohol consumption, and self-esteem was given to the adolescents.; RESULTS: Of 287 adolescents, three were excluded because of mental deficiency. Of the 284 adolescents included in the study (135 girls and 149 boys), 48 (16.9 %) had learning disorders. No significant differences were found between sexes (18.1 % in boys vs. 15.55 % in girls). Learning disorders increased with the number of siblings (p 0.003). The prevalence was greater in the lower social classes (classes I, II, III: 6 %; class IV: 15.9 %; class V: 33 %; p 0.019) and in families with psychosocial risk factors (48.4 % vs. 12.7 %; p > 0.0001). Adolescents with learning disorders participated less in sports (50 % vs. 60.6 %; p 0.03), read less frequently (8.3 % vs. 27.1 %; p 0.005) and watched more TV on working days (2.4 hours/day vs. 1.6 hours/day; p 0.033). Girls with learning disorders were less aware of contraceptive methods (71.4 % vs. 95.6 %; p 0.0002) and of sexually transmitted diseases (71.4 % vs. 93 %; p 0.003). Adolescents with learning disorders started smoking earlier (39.6 % vs. 20.8 %, p 0.0053) but no differences were found in regular smoking.; CONCLUSIONS: Learning disorders constitute a common problem requiring pediatric care due to their influence on adolescents' overall health and their relationship with risk factors such as lower awareness of birth control and sexually transmitted diseases, greater sedentariness, and earlier initiation of smoking.

AB Society increasingly holds schools responsible for the effectiveness of health promotion activities, such as drug abuse prevention efforts funded through the federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools program. Consequently, school districts use student surveys as a method for assessing trends and evaluating effects of programs on behavior. Because cost and practical concerns often preclude consistent population-based school survey sampling, risk indicators can provide an essential tool in analyzing needs assessment and program evaluation data. In this paper, three risk measures associated with substance use were selected from among commonly used school surveys. These measures--truancy, grade point average, and recent sexual intercourse--were compared, using meta-analysis techniques, to assess the reliability of risk measures across different survey instruments, different communities, and different points in time. Truancy was judged superior, because of its strong predictive value, particularly among younger students, and because rates can be compared to school records to assess sampling validity over time.

AB INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to describe trends in food habits in Denmark derived from a food frequency survey conducted by the Danish Nutrition Council in 2001 and compare it to similar surveys from 1995 and 1998.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: A random population sample of 1000 men and women (aged 15-91 years) were interviewed by telephone. They were asked 13 food frequency questions about nutritionally important foods (yoghurt, milk, cheese, rye bread, wheat bread, sandwiches with fish, fish as the main meal, meat as the main meal, potatoes, rice/pasta, vegetables (two questions) fruit) and about the type of milk and fat spreads most often used.; RESULTS: Several of the changes seen from 1995 to 1998 had continued into the 1998-2001 period. The results showed increased frequencies for shredded salad/raw vegetables and rice/pasta, but reduced frequencies for meat as the main meal and potatoes. Fruit consumption had also increased between 1998 and 2001. Average frequencies differed by 13-28%. Another pronounced trend was the increased use of low-fat milk (< or = 0.5% fat) instead of whole milk (42% drinking low-fat milk in 2001 versus 28% in 1998) and the greater numbers who did not spread any kind of fat on their bread (40% versus 22% in 1995, for rye bread).; DISCUSSION: In general the observed trends point in the right direction in respect of food-based dietary guidelines and other recommendations. This indicates that the Danish population has been influenced by the nutritional messages and campaigns stressing fat reduction and increased intake of fruit and vegetables. An important factor in this context is the increasing availability of low-fat milk products on the Danish market. Whether or not the positive trends for foods included are supported by the rest of the diet remains to be answered.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to elucidate characteristics of persons likely to transition into injection drug use so that an identifiable group with high-risk for blood-borne infection may be targeted for interventions.; METHODS: An age-matched case-control analysis was performed from a cohort study in Baltimore, 1997-1999, of street-recruited non-injection and injection drug users (IDUs), aged 15-30. Cases were IDUs injecting < or = 2 years and controls were age-matched persons who used non-injection heroin, cocaine or crack. At baseline, all were interviewed about prior year-by-year behaviors; analysis using conditional logistic regression was based on information for the year prior to injection onset for the case and the same calendar time for the controls as well as recent behaviors for both groups.; RESULTS: Of 270 participants, most were African American (78%), female (61%), and HIV seroprevalence was 7% at baseline. IDUs were significantly more likely than controls to be non-African American (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.09) and report high school dropout (AOR=2.32), early sex-trading (AOR=2.72), and recent violence victimization (AOR=9.28).; CONCLUSION: Given that new injectors are at high-risk for HIV and hepatitis yet difficult to reach for prevention efforts, our data suggest some categories to use to target non-injectors who are likely to transition into injection use.

AB OBJECTIVES: The overall aim was to examine how working conditions in 1993 influenced the occurrence of poor mental health in 1997 among women and men from the general population. Also, the relative importance of other living conditions in relation to poor mental health in 1997 was examined.; METHODS: A sample from the general Swedish population (originally examined in 1969) was followed up in 1993 and 1997. Data from these follow-ups were analysed, and both bivariate and multivariate analyses of associations between occupational and non-occupational conditions in 1993 and poor mental health in 1997 -- defined as sub-clinical depression, reduced psychological well-being and high alcohol consumption -- were performed.; RESULTS: Several occupational risk indicators were identified for poor mental health among women, especially sub-clinical depression and high alcohol consumption. Occupational factors such as shift work, job strain, no education at the employer's expense, low occupational pride, low stimulation at work and poor social support were related to poor mental health among women. For poor mental health among men, mainly sub-clinical depression, shift work and low occupational pride were identified as risk indicators. Non-occupational factors related to poor mental health among women were poor quality of social contacts, demanding life events, physical inactivity, high perceived physical load outside work and inadequate coping strategies. Among men, smoking and inadequate coping strategies were related to poor mental health.; CONCLUSIONS: The difference between women and men, regarding the numbers of identified occupational and non-occupational risk indicators, may partly be explained by the gender-segregated labour market, and partly by other explanations. In our study, we have not succeeded in collecting the relevant information about occupational conditions that is important for men's mental health.

AB A substantial proportion (44%) of traffic injury cases seeking emergency services in public hospitals had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.1 per cent or more. To reduce alcohol related traffic injuries and deaths, a law was enacted setting a criminal per se legal blood alcohol limit at 0.05 per cent in 1994. However, not until 1997, was an active public education program undertaken on a national scale to raise awareness against drink driving and to support law enforcement. This includes dissemination of knowledge through multiple channels e.g., roadside posters; stickers on the back of vehicles; sporadic radio and TV programs or spots; public announcements; press reports. In 1999, highly visible sobriety check points were set up as a measure for law enforcement. In order to systematically assess the campaign, multiple methods were used to collect relevant data. This report focused on the outcomes of the campaign based on hospital surveillance data in the emergency rooms of 4 public hospitals from March to November, 2000 on alternate months. It was found that the campaign succeeded in raising public awareness and support for law enforcement against drink driving. However, the proportion of road victims with illegal BAC seeking emergency care did not decline after 17 months of the campaign. Limitations and weaknesses of law enforcement activities were discussed along with recommendation for future action.

AB There are no gold-standard tests for evaluating a teen suspected of abusing substances. Awareness of the high prevalence of substance abuse in youth, a high index of suspicion, and a firm desire to be a part of the solution are all that is required to address the problem of substance abuse in youth. In an age of "dotcoms" and societal complexity that fosters an emotionally "disconnected" atmosphere by uniting adolescents only by what they buy, plug into, click on, or blast away, teens need trusted medical homes where caring pediatricians are available to give youth accurate and authoritative facts and care to help them build inner resilience and connect them to the pain and hurt of the people in their lives. Until now, the "three strikes and you're out" maxim has been applied in medical care. This maxim may work for baseball, Clintonomics, and practical office management strategies but is not recommended for addressing the needs of substance using or abusing youth who are prey to advertising strategies. The size of the marketing and advertising budgets of the alcohol and cigarette industries is an indication of the relentless marketing directed toward vulnerable youth. Pediatricians would be doing teens a disservice if they fail to countermand this marketing effect by not using the "rule of seven"--the "seven 'S' screen," seven education attempts, seven different ways over 7 years, and persistence over seven attempts of chemically dependent adolescents to quit. It has been said by Osler that "These are our methods--to carefully observe the phenomena of life in all its stages, to cultivate the reasoning of the faculty so as to be able to know the true from the false. This is our work--to prevent disease, to relieve suffering, to heal the sick," and provide HOPE always.

AB Injection drug use is inextricably linked to commercial sex work and the transmission of sexually transmitted disease (STD). In many communities prevention efforts have been stalled owing to the marginal existence of this community. This study describes the sexual activities, condom use, reported STDs, and commercial sex work in a large cohort of injection drug users. Seventy two per cent of male and 92% of female subjects in the cohort were sexually active. Among female subjects, 57% reported more than 100 lifetime partners. Condoms were generally not used with regular partners, used about half the time with casual partners, and used about 80% of the time with paying partners. Female sex workers were more likely to have unstable housing and to report incarceration in the previous six months. Reducing the transmission of STDs and HIV in drug using communities is a public health priority. While existing prevention programmes should be strengthened, innovative approaches to STD surveillance, diagnosis, and prevention are needed.

AB Economic research has contributed to the evaluation of alcohol policy through empirical analysis of the effects of alcohol-control measures on alcohol consumption and its consequences. It has also provided an accounting framework for defining and comparing costs and benefits of alcohol consumption and related policy interventions, including excise taxes. The most important finding from the economics literature is that consumers tend to drink less ethanol, and have fewer alcohol-related problems, when alcoholic beverage prices are increased or alcohol availability is restricted. That set of findings is relevant for policy purposes because alcohol abuse imposes large "external" costs on others. Important challenges remain, including developing a better understanding of the effects of drinking on labor-market productivity.

AB The 2001 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study surveyed students at 119 4-year colleges that participated in the 1993, 1997, and 1999 studies. Responses in the 4 survey years were compared to determine trends in heavy alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and encounters with college and community prevention efforts. In 2001, approximately 2 in 5 (44.4%) college students reported binge drinking, a rate almost identical to rates in the previous 3 surveys. Very little change in overall binge drinking occurred at the individual college level. The percentages of abstainers and frequent binge drinkers increased, a polarization of drinking behavior first noted in 1997. A sharp rise in frequent binge drinking was noted among students attending all-women's colleges. Other significant changes included increases in immoderate drinking and harm among drinkers. More students lived in substance-free housing and encountered college educational efforts and sanctions resulting from their alcohol use.

AB OBJECTIVE: The question addressed in this review is whether aggregate alcohol advertising increases alcohol consumption among college students. Both the level of alcohol-related problems on college campuses and the level of alcohol advertising are high. Some researchers have concluded that the cultural myths and symbols used in alcohol advertisements have powerful meanings for college students and affect intentions to drink. There is, however, very little empirical evidence that alcohol advertising has any effect on actual alcohol consumption.; METHOD: The methods used in this review include a theoretical framework for evaluating the effects of advertising. This theory suggests that the marginal effect of advertising diminishes at high levels of advertising. Many prior empirical studies measured the effect of advertising at high levels of advertising and found no effect. Those studies that measure advertising at lower, more disaggregated levels have found an effect on consumption.; RESULTS: The results of this review suggest that advertising does increase consumption. However, advertising cannot be reduced with limited bans, which are likely to result in substitution to other available media. Comprehensive bans on all forms of advertising and promotion can eliminate options for substitution and be potentially more effective in reducing consumption. In addition, there is an increasing body of literature that suggests that alcohol counteradvertising is effective in reducing the alcohol consumption of teenagers and young adults.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased counteradvertising, rather than new advertising bans, appears to be the better choice for public policy. It is doubtful that the comprehensive advertising bans required to reduce advertising would ever receive much public support. New limited bans on alcohol advertising might also result in less alcohol counteradvertising. An important topic for future research is to identify the counteradvertising themes that are most effective with youth.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate the more immediate health effects of smoking and drinking among adolescents.; METHODS: Secondary analyses of data from the 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse were conducted to explore the relationship between subjective and objective health outcomes and the use of alcohol and tobacco among adolescents.; RESULTS: The findings suggest that adolescents who smoke or drink actually report poorer health during adolescence than those who do not. In fact, adolescents who are frequent or heavy alcohol and tobacco users report poorer subjective overall health and a greater number of overnight hospital stays during the previous year than less frequent or intense users and than nonusers. In addition, the data revealed a number of significant gender and age group differences in reports of health outcome as well.; CONCLUSIONS: Demonstrating to youngsters the more immediate, negative health consequences of alcohol and tobacco use might strengthen prevention messages and ultimately decrease the use of these substances among adolescents.

AB Ketamine is a rapid-acting anesthetic commonly used during surgical procedures in both animals and humans, as an experimental drug in the treatment of chronic pain, and as a probe for the study of the cause of schizophrenia. When used medically as an anesthetic it is administered as an intravenous (IV) solution, but when diverted to the illicit market it can be injected, snorted, smoked, or consumed in drinks. Ketamine produces effects similar in some respects to phencyclidine (PCP) and lysergic acid (LSD), but of shorter duration. Psychedelic effects are produced quickly by low doses of the drug, although larger doses are frequently used in an attempt to produce "near-death" experiences. Convulsions and death can be caused by higher doses, although most deaths in which ketamine is detected are the result of poly-drug use or trauma. Reports of ketamine use at rave parties attended by young adults appear to be on the rise. The effects from ketamine last from 1-5 hours, and ketamine can be detected in the urine for a period of 1-2 days following use.  Copyright © 2002 Central Police University.

AB BACKGROUND: Smoking often begins in early adolescence, and addiction can occur rapidly. For effective smoking prevention efforts with younger children, knowledge of their early smoking experience is needed. The purpose of this paper was to report the smoking experience of French elementary school children and to describe their lifestyle habits and health knowledge.; METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 913 children age 9-11 years in 31 randomly selected schools of the Loire administrative department in France was conducted, using anonymous previously validated questionnaires. Correlates of smoking initiation and intention to smoke in the future were assessed by unconditional logistic regression analysis.; RESULTS: A total of 12.3% of the children had smoked at least one cigarette, 5.1% within the previous 30 days. Correlates of ever smoking were male sex, older age, engaging in physical activity, reporting not following safety-related recommendations, or drinking alcohol. Of the 112 children who reported ever smoking, 45.5% stated that they did not want to remain smokers in the future and an additional 26.8% were not sure.; CONCLUSIONS: Information on the smoking experience of preadolescents should help in designing effective prevention programs, which are essential for reinforcing abstinence in nonsmokers and preventing others from progressing to addiction.

AB Many studies have found strong peer correlations for a variety of problem behaviors that begin in adolescence (e.g. substance use). Such correlations are commonly attributed to peer influences, but could also be explained by selective ('assortative') friendship: the tendency for those with similar patterns of behavior to become friends. Here we show how, under certain assumptions, cross-sectional data from pairs of siblings or twins and their peers may be used to resolve the contributions of peer selection and reciprocal peer environmental influences to peer resemblance. We performed power calculations to determine necessary sample sizes for rejecting with 80% power, at the 5% significance level, the hypothesis of only peer selection effects, or only reciprocal peer environmental effects. A false hypothesis of only selective friendship effects was always easier to reject than a false hypothesis of only reciprocal peer environmental influences. Limitations of these simulations, including uncertainty about the most appropriate way to model peer selection, are discussed.

AB UNLABELLED: The objective of this study was to determine adolescents' attitudes concerning the use of self-care and traditional medicines. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire with open-ended questions was completed by 543 adolescents aged 15-19 y. The results showed that the most frequent self-care activity for general health problems, in more than three-quarters of them, was self-medication; 14% of them resorted to minor home treatment such as taking care of wounds, bandaging or massages. Instructions for use were mentioned by 69% of adolescents as a way of choosing self-prescribed drugs. Natural medicines were used by 32% of the girls and 23% of the boys, mainly herbal teas or plant-based medicines, followed by homoeopathy. Self-care for emotional and relational problems mainly involved thinking about the problem and questioning themselves about their own behaviour or about the way they are. They also mentioned activities such as sports, going out, listening to music, watching television, and trying to think about something else by keeping themselves occupied. Natural medicines were used by 19% of the girls and 13% of the boys. Plant-based medicines or herbal teas were used most often, followed by drugs or alcohol, with homoeopathy in third place.; CONCLUSION: Self-care and alternative medicines were used by adolescents in this study for physical as well as for emotional or relational problems. Their use did not reflect dissatisfaction with physicians and hospital treatment or an objection to formal services, but rather was a choice of these approaches for their own specific characteristics. They were also viewed as being less harmful than conventional treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a major problem in the Reunion Island and the Public Health Authorities decided to determine its prevalence in their medico-social centers on 31 December 1996.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was established to identify affected patients in the 20 medico-social centers in charge of 1320 children. Eighty-eight children were selected and 87 could be analyzed.; RESULTS: Sixty-four of 87 (76.3%) were FAS and 23 of 87 (23.7%) had closely alcohol-related diseases. The prevalence was between 7.1 and 14.1% and lower than expected from available data.; CONCLUSION: The study allowed to precise the social and familial factors predisposing to alcohol addiction during pregnancy. A TV prevention message will be broadcasted after this study.

AB BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates of psychiatric and substance use disorders among young adults in South Florida are presented. Unique aspects of the study include the large sample size, its ethnic diversity, and the fact that a substantial proportion of Hispanic participants were foreign born.; METHODS: This study builds on a previous cohort study of students who entered middle school in 1990. A random subsample of this representative cohort (N = 1803) was interviewed between 1998 and 2000 when most were between 19 and 21 years of age. Disorders were assessed through computer-assisted personal interviews utilizing the DSM-IV version of the Michigan Composite International Diagnostic Interview.; RESULTS: More than 60% of the sample met lifetime criteria for 1 or more study disorders, and 38% did so within the preceding year. Childhood conduct and major depressive and alcohol abuse disorders were the most prevalent. Although rates of affective and anxiety disorders in females were double that in males, this gender difference disappeared when attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorders, and antisocial personality disorders were also considered (46.6% vs 45.7% for females vs males, respectively). Substantially lower rates were observed among African Americans for depressive disorders and substance abuse and dependence. Among Hispanics, rates tend to be lower among the foreign-born in comparison with their US-born counterparts, particularly for the substance disorders.; CONCLUSIONS: The documented presence of psychiatric and substance disorders in middle and high school populations emphasizes the importance of prevention efforts in school settings. Research on the origins of ethnic and nativity differences is called for.

TI Asian migration to Australia: food and health consequences.

SO Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition
VL 11 Suppl 3
PS S562-8
PY 2002
PD 2002 
AB Australia's food and health patterns are inextricably and increasingly linked with Asia. Indigenous Australians arrived in the continent via Asia and have linguistic connections with people who settled in south India; there was interaction and food trade between both South-East Asia and China and northern indigenous Australians over thousands of years. After European settlement in 1788, there have been several and increasing (apart from the period of the infamous White Australian Policy following the Colonial period and Independence, with Federation, in 1901) waves of Asian migration, notably during the gold rush (Chinese), the building of the overland Telegraph (Afghans), the Colombo Plan and Asian student education in Australia from the 1950s onwards (South-Eeast Asians), and with refugees (Vietnamese and mainland Chinese), and business (late twentieth century) and progressive family reunion. Each wave has injected additional food cultural elements and caused a measure of health change for migrants and host citizens. Of principal advantage to Australia has been the progressive diversification of the food supply and associated health protection. This has increased food security and sustainability. The process of Australian eating patterns becoming Asianized is evident through market garden development (and the introduction of new foods), fresh food markets and groceries, restaurants and the development of household cooking skills (often taught by student boarders). Most of the diversification has been with grain (rice), legumes (soy), greens, root vegetables, and various 'exotic fruits'. Food acculturation with migration is generally bi-directional. Thus, for Asians in Australia, there has been a decrease in energy expenditure (and a lower plane of energy throughput), an increase in food energy density (through increased fat and sugary drink intakes), and a decrease in certain health protective foods (lentils, soy, greens) and beverages (tea). This sets the stage for 'eco-diseases'. In a population probably genetically programmed (but modifiably) in utero to abdominal obesity, diabetes (type II and gestational) and cardiovascular disease, these conditions may be rapidly acquired on migration, along with certain cancers (breast, colo-rectal and prostate). Thus, whilst Asian migration to Australia has provided health opportunities for host citizens, there have been threats to migrant citizens in regard to nutrition-related health.

Youth remanded to juvenile correctional facilities in a southern US state completed a structured interview regarding abuse history, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and demographics. Adolescents who experienced sullen affect were significantly more likely to engage in behaviors that put them at risk for HIV infection. Moreover, higher levels of alcohol use predicted HIV risk behavior. HIV prevention efforts need to address emotional distress as well as substance use among delinquent adolescents to reduce HIV risk behavior. Implications for treatment and future research are discussed.

TI The role of nonpharmaceutic conservative interventions in the treatment and secondary prevention of epilepsy.
AU Wolf, Peter
SO Epilepsia
VL 43 Suppl 9
PS 2-5
PY 2002
PD 2002 
AB Nonpharmacologic conservative treatments receive too little attention. Depending on the clinical condition of the patients, they may be used alone or in conjunction with other therapies. Their target is the single seizure rather than the epileptic condition as such. They belong mainly to one of three domains. NONSPECIFIC PREVENTION OF SEIZURES: The first step is the identification of factors facilitating the occurrence of seizures. In the second step, strategies to control these factors are developed. Most common are disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, especially reduction of sleep. Patients should follow a regular sleep schedule with deviations of not >2 h. Sometimes a sleep calendar is helpful. Night shifts are not compatible with seizure prevention in these cases. Sleep disturbances as a facilitating factor of seizures are particularly common in juvenile idiopathic generalized epilepsies, in which their avoidance is in many cases an indispensable part of the therapeutic regimen, along with appropriate drug treatment. They are the most common precipitating factor in adolescents and adults with a first epileptic [mostly generalized tonic-clonic (GTC)] seizure. In these instances, their avoidance is central to the secondary prevention of epilepsy developing from the single seizure, whereas the prescription of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is rarely effective. Other nonspecific facilitators of seizures include uncontrolled use of alcohol and extraordinary stress. Patients must learn how to cope with stressful events. SPECIFIC PREVENTION OF SEIZURES: In reflex epilepsies, specific precipitants of seizures are the targets of interventions. Thus, most patients with primary reading epilepsy begin to have, with prolonged reading, perioral reflex myoclonias, which enable them to stop reading and thus to avoid a GTC seizure. In photosensitive patients, seizures are often precipitated by television. These can be avoided by viewing from a distance and using a remote control, small screens in a well-lit room, and preferably with a 100-Hz line shift. Environmental flicker stimulation often comes unexpectedly, and it is advisable that the patients always wear sunglasses in brightly lighted surroundings. Polarized glasses seem to be more protective than plain sunglasses. If the patient has only photically induced seizures, treatment by specific prevention alone may be sufficient, but if spontaneous seizures also occur, drugs must be given in addition. ARREST OF SEIZURES: Focal seizures that develop sufficiently slowly to leave the patient time to react may be interrupted by "countermeasures." These, again, may be nonspecific (acting by relaxation, concentration, or a combination of both) or specific. The latter are individually tailored, based either on spontaneous experiences of the patient or on the anatomy of ictogenesis. Seizure propagation is blocked when a major part of the neurons involved is activated and not recruitable for spread of the epileptic discharge. Seizure arrest rarely is used alone but usually in combination with partially successful pharmacotherapy.

AB Using data from a large-scale antimarijuana media campaign, this investigation examined the demographic and psychographic variables associated with exposure to public service announcements designed to target high sensation-seeking adolescents. The literature on sensation seeking indicates that adolescents high in this trait are at greater risk for substance abuse. Analyses assessed the predictive utility of various risk and protective factors, normative influences, demographic variables, and marijuana-related attitudes, intentions, and behaviors on campaign message exposure. Results confirm that level of sensation seeking was positively associated with greater message exposure. In addition, viewers reporting greater exposure were younger adolescents who indicated that they had poor family relations, promarijuana attitudes, and friends and family who used marijuana. Implications for designing future antimarijuana messages based on these findings are discussed.

AB A substantial percentage of infants, children and adolescents experience gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its accompanying symptoms, as well as disease complications. The diagnosis of GERD in children is made based upon the child's history, and data derived primarily from pH monitoring tests and endoscopy. In those children with confirmed reflux disease, the options for management parallel those recommended in adult patients, with the first step consisting of lifestyle changes. Surgical procedures may also be performed; however, these are rarely recommended prior to an adequate course of pharmacologic therapy, and appropriate case selection is important. Among the current pharmacotherapeutic options available in the US, the prokinetic agents and the acid-inhibitory agents (histamine-2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are the most widely used. The clinical utility of the prokinetic agents has been limited by the recent withdrawal of cisapride from the US marketplace and the potential for irreversible central nervous system complications with metoclopramide. Numerous clinical studies performed in adults, and several studies involving children, have demonstrated that the proton pump inhibitors are more effective than the histamine-2 receptor antagonists in the relief of GERD symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. In children, omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered as the intact oral capsule, or in those who are unable or unwilling to swallow, the granule contents of the capsule may be mixed with soft foods (e.g. apple sauce) or fruit drinks/liquid dietary supplements prior to oral administration with no detrimental effects on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, or pharmacodynamics. Studies performed with omeprazole and lansoprazole in children have shown pharmacokinetic parameters that closely resemble those observed in adults. In over a decade of use in adults, the proton pump inhibitor class of agents has been found to have a good safety profile. Studies involving children have also shown these agents to be well tolerated. In numerous drug-drug interaction studies performed with these two proton pump inhibitors, relatively few clinically significant interactions have been observed.

School factors and drug-use modeling of peers and family were the most important risk factors for marijuana abuse or dependence for both European and African Americans.; CONCLUSION: Personal, familial, and social context factors during early adolescence affect adult drug-use problems, particularly for African Americans. Levels of drug use are lower among African Americans, but exposure to risks is higher and there are clear differences in the long-range impact of risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of developing and timing appropriate prevention efforts.

The problems that were discussed included threats of contemporary world such as: alcoholism, smoking, excessive participation in watching TV, video and Internet. During the meeting drawings, graphics arts and poetry enabled informal entering into conversation with young people and encouraged them to express their opinions. At the next meeting, which took place in High School, a survey was carried out in a group of 33 teenagers. The results of the survey showed that young people assign 6 hours 30 min. on average for rest at night, 3 hours 20 min. on average for watching TV, 2 hours 45 min. for computer, 2 hours 30 min for Internet, 1 hour 30 min for video. 12 out of 27 teenagers are mentally and physically tired after school, 15 teenagers have a rest after school, 18 teenagers fell ill during the school year and answered that they are nervous. 6 answered that they are sometimes nervous. 17 young people like alcohol and tried have it and 6 were drunk up. 14 teenagers like commercials on TV and 19 do not like them 27 children do not belong to any organisations. 12 teenagers have smoked cigarettes and 9 rarely have smoked cigarettes. 1 teenager has taken drugs. American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Public Education describes the possible negative health effects of television viewing on children and adolescents, such as violent or aggressive behavior, substance use, sexual activity, obesity, poor body image, and decreased school performance. In addition to the television ratings system and the v-chip (electronic device to block programming), media education is an effective approach to mitigate these potential problems. The European Society of Social Paediatrics (ESSOP) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers a list of recommendations on this issue for pediatricians and for parents, the federal government, and entertainment industry.

Height and body weight were measured.; SUBJECTS: Students in grades 7-12 who were enrolled in participating schools, had parental consent and were in attendance on the day of data collection.; MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of fast food restaurant use (FFFRU), dietary intake, and demographic and behavioral measures were self-reported. Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Height and body weight were directly measured.; RESULTS: FFFRU was positively associated with intake of total energy, percent energy from fat, daily servings of soft drinks, cheeseburgers, french fries and pizza, and was inversely associated with daily servings of fruit, vegetables and milk. FFFRU was positively associated with student employment, television viewing, home availability of unhealthy foods, and perceived barriers to healthy eating, and was inversely associated with students' own and perceived maternal and peer concerns about healthy eating. FFFRU was not associated with overweight status.; CONCLUSIONS: FFFRU is associated with higher energy and fat intake among adolescents. Interventions to reduce reliance on fast food restaurants may need to address perceived importance of healthy eating as well as time and convenience barriers.

AB Drug addictions are often viewed as compulsive behaviors, not sensitive to the typical rules of self-discipline or market forces. Nonetheless, many governments try to discourage consumption of addictive substances through macro policy tools, such as taxation, regulation and prohibition, in an effort to reduce the harmful consequences that result from their consumption. The government's ability to discourage this type of behavior through these macro policies depends critically on the responsiveness of addictive consumption to market interventions. This paper reviews the growing literature that applies economic principles to the analysis of "substance abuse." Specifically, we review the impact of prices and public policies on the demands for tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The findings from these studies clearly demonstrate that even addictive behaviors are sensitive to changes in the price of substances being abused. When the full price of the addictive good rises, consumption of that good falls, even among abusers. Therefore, public policies that raise the full price of a drug to a consumer, particularly youth, are likely to result in long run reductions in rates of addiction.

A sample of 508 adolescents (238 females, 270 males; mean age = 15.1 years) completed the Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI), and the Intensity and Novelty subscales of the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking. Users of each substance also completed the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R) and/or author-compiled measures for assessing motives for cigarette smoking and marijuana use, respectively. Multiple regression analyses revealed that, in the case of each drug, the block of personality variables predicted "risky" substance use motives (i.e., coping, enhancement, and/or conformity motives) over-and-above demographics. High intensity seeking and low anxiety sensitivity predicted enhancement motives for alcohol use, high anxiety sensitivity predicted conformity motives for alcohol and marijuana use, and high trait anxiety predicted coping motives for alcohol and cigarette use. Moreover, anxiety sensitivity moderated the relation between trait anxiety and coping motives for alcohol and cigarette use: the trait anxiety-coping motives relation was stronger for high, than for low, anxiety sensitive individuals. Implications of the findings for improving substance abuse prevention efforts for youth will be discussed.

AB Examples of gene-environment interaction in human behavioral data are relatively rare; those that exist have used simple, dichotomous measures of the environment. The authors describe a model that allows for the specification of more continuous, more realistic variations in environments as moderators of genetic and environmental influences on behavior. Using data from a population-based Finnish twin study, the authors document strong moderating effects of socioregional environments on genetic and environmental influences on adolescent alcohol use, with nearly a five-fold difference in the magnitude of genetic effects between environmental extremes. The incorporation of specific environmental measures into genetically informative designs should prove to be a powerful method for better understanding the nature of gene-environment interaction and its contribution to the etiology of behavioral variation.

AB OBJECTIVE: This longitudinal study investigated Grade-7 and Grade-10 risk factors for alcohol misuse at Grade 12. Alcohol misuse was conceptualized as problem-related drinking (e.g., missing school), high-risk drinking (e.g., drunk driving) and high consumption.; METHOD: Prospective analyses using two-part models predicted any alcohol misuse and the amount of misuse (given that some has occurred) for over 4,200 (52% male) participants in the RAND Adolescent Panel Study. Predictor variables were demographics, substance use and exposure, prodrug attitudes, rebelliousness and deviant behavior, self-esteem, family structure and relations, and grades.; RESULTS: Grade-7 predictors of alcohol misuse 5 years later included early drinking onset, parental drinking, future intentions to drink, cigarette offers, difficulty resisting pressures to smoke, being white, being male, having an older sibling, deviant behavior and poor grades. By Grade 10, predictors of alcohol misuse 2 years later included drinking and marijuana use by self and peers, future intentions to drink, difficulty resisting pressures to drink and use marijuana, being male, coming from a disrupted family and deviant behavior. Somewhat different predictors were identified for problem-related, high-risk and high consumption drinking, emphasizing the importance of investigating multiple dimensions of misuse.; CONCLUSIONS: The high social acceptability of alcohol use makes prevention difficult. Curbing alcohol misuse may be a more attainable goal than preventing any use. These results indicate that predictors of misuse in late adolescence can be identified by Grade 7 and are generally visible and modifiable. Prevention efforts should begin by early adolescence, address both familial and peer influences to drink and use other substances, and take into account problems that predict alcohol misuse (e.g., poor academic performance and early deviant behavior).

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine suicide attempts in an epidemiologically and genetically informative youth sample.; METHOD: 3,416 Missouri female adolescent twins (85% participation rate) were interviewed from 1995 to 2000 with a telephone version of the Child Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism, which includes a detailed suicidal behavior section. Mean age was 15.5 years at assessment.; RESULTS: At least one suicide attempt was reported by 4.2% of the subjects. First suicide attempts were all made before age 18 (and at a mean age of 13.6). Major depressive disorder, alcohol dependence, childhood physical abuse, social phobia, conduct disorder, and African-American ethnicity were the factors most associated with a suicide attempt history. Suicide attempt liability was familial, with genetic and shared environmental influences together accounting for 35% to 75% of the variance in risk. The twin/cotwin suicide attempt odds ratio was 5.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-17.8) for monozygotic twins and 4.0 (95% CI 1.1 -14.7) for dizygotic twins after controlling for other psychiatric risk factors.; CONCLUSIONS: In women, the predisposition to attempt suicide seems usually to manifest itself first during adolescence. The data show that youth suicide attempts are familial and possibly influenced by genetic factors, even when controlling for other psychopathology.

AB This research examined the effect of students' drinking behaviors in high school on their alcohol use and alcohol problems in college. Five colleges in New York State were randomly selected for the study. The telephone interview method was employed to survey college students during the spring semester of 1998. Within each participating college, students were randomly selected through the use of complete student telephone directories provided by the college administration. A total of 813 students were interviewed. Alcohol problems were measured with items from DSM-IV. Results indicate that both frequency and quantity of alcohol use in high school significantly affect students' alcohol consumption in college. Furthermore, the impact of alcohol use in high school on alcohol problems in college tends to be composed of a moderate direct effect and a relatively strong indirect effect via its impact on current alcohol consumption in college. Prevention efforts for drinking in college may need to start in high school to reduce or delay alcohol use by high school students. Additional assessment services and more readily available treatment services may be required to address potential alcohol problems among college students. Future research should examine the effect and longevity of students' alcohol problem symptoms after they graduate from college.

AB Marketplace practices are integral to the larger economic and social context of adolescent health risk behaviors. To corporations and marketers, adolescents represent a gold mine of current and future profits. Adolescent incomes increased by almost a third in the 1990s. The annual spending of the U.S. adolescent population is estimated now to have reached 155 billion US dollars. The sheer size of the adolescent population and its spending power are of keen interest to corporations and marketers. This chapter presents a brief history of youth-targeted marketing and examines the major avenues in the media and inside schools that marketers and corporations use today to reach adolescents with their messages and products. It outlines the impact of consumerism and marketing on adolescent health using five case examples: tobacco, alcohol, cosmetic surgery, laxatives, and diet pills. It then concludes with a discussion of resistance efforts, led by health advocates, policy makers, parents, and youth themselves to restrict sales of harmful products to youth and curtail advertisers' access to adolescents in schools. A critical role for adolescent health researchers and advocates is to contribute a public health perspective into ongoing debates over regulating business practices that negatively affect the health of young people.

AB A model of problematic adolescent behavior that expands current theories of social skill deficits in delinquent behavior to consider both social skills and orientation toward the use of adaptive skills was examined in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 113 male and female adolescents. Adolescents were selected on the basis of moderate to serious risk for difficulties in social adaptation in order to focus on the population of youth most likely to be targeted by prevention efforts. Structural equation modeling was used to examine cross-sectional data using multiple informants (adolescents, peers, and parents) and multiple methods (performance test and self-report). Adolescent social orientation, as reflected in perceived problem solving effectiveness, identification with adult prosocial values, and self-efficacy expectations, exhibited a direct association to delinquent behavior and an indirect association to drug involvement mediated by demonstrated success in using problem solving skills. Results suggest that the utility of social skill theories of adolescent problem behaviors for informing preventive and remedial interventions can be enhanced by expanding them to consider adolescents' orientation toward using the skills they may already possess.

AB AIMS: Genotype-environment correlation refers to the extent to which individuals are exposed to environments as a function of their genetic propensities. These correlations are important in the study of psychopathology because they identify environments that may maintain the expression of underlying genetic liabilities for a disorder. The present study examined the correlation between genetic liabilities for alcohol and drug misuse with perceptions of the social environments of the family of origin and the classroom.; DESIGN: Postal survey data were collected from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.; SETTING: Twin pairs were recruited from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada using newspaper advertisements and media stories.; PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five monozygotic and 77 dizygotic twin pairs were recruited from the general population.; MEASUREMENTS: Twin pairs completed self-report measures of alcohol and drug misuse contained in the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology, the Family Environment Scale, the Classroom Environment Scale, and the Traumatic Events Questionnaire.; FINDINGS: Genetically indexed alcohol and drug misuse scores were regressed on the environmentally indexed FES and CES scales. Genetic liabilities for alcohol and drug misuse were associated with decreased perceived family moral-religious emphases, family cohesion and classroom task orientation and increased perceptions of classroom order and organization (strictness).; CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-environment correlations, in particular, moral-religious emphases in the home, appear to be important in the development of substance misuse.

AB BACKGROUND: The Russian-American Partners for Prevention was an adaptation and evaluation of the Slick Tracy Home Team Program which was developed in Minnesota in order to delay the onset of drinking. The Slick Tracy Home Team Program was the first intervention of Project Northland, a large 3 year community trial of the efficacy of a public health intervention for under age drinking.; METHODS: The programme was administered through schools, but involved parents using engaging and fun homework activities. The Russian version was implemented in fifth-grade classrooms in 20 Moscow schools with 1,212 students surveyed at baseline. Students were surveyed again after programme implementation (n = 1,182), of whom 980 were present at baseline. Parents of 1,078 students were surveyed by telephone after programme implementation.; RESULTS: The results demonstrated the successful recruitment and retention of 20 Moscow schools in a research project, acceptability of programme materials in Russia, high participation rates, changes in students' knowledge about problems associated with under age drinking and some evidence about increases in parent-child communication about alcohol use. As in the USA, no changes in students' alcohol use rates were observed at the end of the first year of the 3 year programme.; CONCLUSION: Russian youth, as compared to Americans, began drinking at earlier ages, received fewer prevention messages from their parents, and had fewer prevention programmes in school. The results suggested that carefully implemented and evaluated replications of the US Project Northland interventions might provide effective and appropriate school-based programmes for Russia.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between parent-adolescent communication about sex-related topics and the sex-related communication and practices of African American adolescent females with partners, as well as their perceived ability to negotiate safer sex.; DESIGN: A theory-guided survey and structured interview were administered to 522 sexually active African American females 14 to 18 years old. Recruitment sites were neighborhoods with high rates of unemployment, substance abuse, violence, and sexually transmitted diseases. Multivariate analyses, controlling for observed covariates, were used to identify the association of less frequent parent-adolescent communication with multiple assessed outcomes.; RESULTS: Less frequent parent-adolescent communication (scores below the median) was associated with adolescents' non-use of contraceptives in the past 6 months (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.7) and non-use of contraceptives during the last 5 sexual encounters (AOR = 1.6). Less communication increased the odds of never using condoms in the past month (AOR = 1.6), during the last 5 sexual encounters (AOR = 1.7), and at last intercourse (AOR = 1.7). Less communication was also associated with less communication between adolescents and their sex partners (AOR = 3.3) and lower self-efficacy to negotiate safer sex (AOR = 1.8).; CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the importance of involving parents in human immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy prevention efforts directed at female adolescents. Pediatricians and other clinicians can play an important role in facilitating parent-adolescent communication about sexual activity.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study examined long-term response to an individual preventive intervention for high-risk college drinkers relative to the natural history of college drinking.; METHODS: A single-session, individualized preventive intervention was evaluated within a randomized controlled trial with college freshmen who reported drinking heavily while in high school. An additional group randomly selected from the entire screening pool provided a normative comparison. Participant self-report was assessed annually for 4 years.; RESULTS: High-risk controls showed secular trends for reduced drinking quantity and negative consequences without changes in drinking frequency. Those receiving the brief preventive intervention reported significant additional reductions, particularly with respect to negative consequences. Categorical individual change analyses show that remission is normative, and they suggest that participants receiving the brief intervention are more likely to improve and less likely to worsen regarding negative drinking consequences.; CONCLUSIONS: Brief individual preventive interventions for high-risk college drinkers can achieve long-term benefits even in the context of maturational trends.

AB In order to conduct a comparative risk analysis for alcohol within the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2000), several questions had to be answered. (1) What are the appropriate dimensions for alcohol consumption and how can they be categorized? The average volume of alcohol and patterns of drinking were selected as dimensions. Both dimensions could be looked upon as continuous but were categorized for practical purposes. The average volume of drinking was categorized into the following categories: abstention; drinking 1 (> 0-19.99 g pure alcohol daily for females, > 0-39.99 g for males); drinking 2 (20-39.99 g for females, 40-59.99 g for males), and drinking 3 (> or =40 g for females, > or =60 g for males). Patterns of drinking were categorized into four levels of detrimental impact based on an optimal scaling analysis of key informant ratings. (2) What is the theoretical minimum for both dimensions? A pattern of regular light drinking (at most 1 drink every day) was selected as theoretical minimum for established market economies for all people above age 45. For all other regions and age groups, the theoretical minimum was set to zero. Potential problems and uncertainties with this selection are discussed. (3) What are the health outcomes for alcohol and how do they relate to the dimensions? Overall, more than 60 disease conditions were identified as being related to alcohol consumption. Most chronic conditions seem to be related to volume only (exceptions are coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke), and most acute conditions seem to be related to volume and patterns. In addition, using methodology based on aggregate data, patterns were relevant for attributing harms for men but not women.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the burden of mortality in young people (age 15-29) in established market economies in Europe in 1999, which is attributable to alcohol consumption. Two dimensions of alcohol consumption were considered: average volume of consumption, and patterns of drinking.; METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the WHO EIP data bank, average volume data from the WHO global databank on alcohol, pattern of drinking data from a questionnaire sent out to experts, from the published literature and from the WHO global databank. Methods are explained and discussed in detail in two other contributions to this volume.; RESULTS: More than 8,000 deaths of people aged 15-29 in Europe in 1999 were attributable to alcohol. Young males show a higher proportion of alcohol-attributable deaths (12.8%) than females (8.3%). Both average volume and patterns of drinking contribute to alcohol-related death.; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-related deaths constitute a considerable burden in young people in Europe.

AB This study uses a functional perspective to examine the reasons young people cite for using psychoactive substances. The study sample comprised 364 young poly-drug users recruited using snowball-sampling methods. Data on life-time and recent frequency and intensity of use for alcohol, cannabis, amphetamines, ecstasy, LSD and cocaine are presented. A majority of the participants had used at least one of these six drugs to fulfil 11 of 18 measured substance use functions. The most popular functions for use were using to: relax (96.7%), become intoxicated (96.4%), keep awake at night while socializing (95.9%), enhance an activity (88.5%) and alleviate depressed mood (86.8%). Substance use functions were found to differ by age and gender. Recognition of the functions fulfilled by substance use should help health educators and prevention strategists to make health messages about drugs more relevant and appropriate to general and specific audiences. Targeting substances that are perceived to fulfil similar functions and addressing issues concerning the substitution of one substance for another may also strengthen education and prevention efforts.

AB PURPOSE: To identify predictors of smoking onset and cessation between early (age 13 years) and late adolescence (age 18 years) and between late adolescence (age 18 years) and young adulthood (age 23 years).; METHODS: We employed logistic regression to predict smoking initiation and cessation for an ethnically diverse sample of 3056 adolescents recruited from 30 West Coast schools in 1985 and observed from age 13 to age 23 years. Fifty-six percent of the sample was female. Predictors tapping sociodemographic characteristics, environmental influences, attitudes and beliefs about smoking, bonds with school, and problem behavior were measured at age 13 years (older teenager models) and at age 18 years (young adult models).; RESULTS: Robust predictors of both initiation and cessation across the two developmental periods included doing poorly in middle/high school and prior smoking behavior. Predictors common to three of the four models included being young for one's grade cohort and intending to smoke in the next 6 months. Early deviant behavior and drinking fostered initiation among older teenagers, but problem behavior as an older teenager did not predict young adult initiation. Smokers who had few or no high school friends who smoked and felt able to resist prosmoking pressures at age 18 years were more likely to quit by age 23 years. Being female predicted initiation by age 18 years; being African-American, Hispanic, or Asian inhibited it.; CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of prior smoking behavior and intentions with later smoking status among both adolescents and young adults underscores the importance of starting smoking prevention early and continuing it through high school. Such programs might also consider the greater vulnerability of females, youth who are young for their grade cohort, and those who are doing poorly in school.

AB This investigation assessed the relative influence of peer norms and parental involvement on adolescent cigarette and alcohol use. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to 2,017 seventh- to 12th-grade students in two Ohio public school districts. Cigarette and alcohol use rates in the sample were comparable to those found in national probability surveys. Results indicated that the relative balance of peer-parent influences did not differ across grade level. At all grade levels, perceived peer norms had substantially greater correlations with cigarette and alcohol use than did measures of perceived parental involvement. The findings are interpreted from an efficiency perspective. Optimal use of prevention resources suggest that programming for seventh- to 12th-graders should focus on shaping the perceptions of peer smoking and drinking practices rather than on parent interventions. Social norms marketing or other forms of normative education should be tested in this population.

We obtained demographic, clinical, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale data.; RESULTS: Most patients were young to middle-aged women; the majority reported symptoms for > 5 years in all three groups. Subject characteristics varied among the groups. Typically, primary care patients were anxious, smokers and daily alcohol drinkers who had sought care recently for irritable bowel syndrome and tried antispasmodic drugs. Their symptoms were intermediate in severity between those of the other two groups. Advertisement subjects were the oldest, most highly educated, most often depressed, and were least likely to have sought care recently for symptoms, which were almost uniformly only moderate in severity. Gastroenterologist patients tended to be anxious and had nearly all sought care recently for symptoms, which were the most severe and most likely to include all three pain-related Rome I criteria.; CONCLUSION: Recruitment methodology affects important characteristics of an irritable bowel syndrome study group.

AB In Minnesota, state legislation, enacted July 1998, provided for voluntary pharmacy sales of syringes/needles without a prescription for an accompanying drug. The goal was to stem HIV transmission among injecting drug users (IDUs) by providing greater access to sterile syringes. We used a pre/post evaluation design to investigate the impact of less restrictive syringe/possession laws on IDUs' HIV-related syringe practices. Independent cross-sectional samples of IDUs were recruited from street sites and a correctional facility immediately before and 1 year after enactment of the laws. Of the 671 IDUs interviewed, 570 (270 prelegislation and 300 postlegislation) had injected at least once in the 30 days before the interview. IDUs were more likely to purchase syringes at pharmacies after enactment of the laws (odds ratio [OR], 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-3.85), yet did not change their behaviors regarding carrying unused syringes (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63-1.28). After adjusting for speedball injection and criminal history, syringe sharing decreased among IDUs (adjusted OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-1.00) yet syringe reuse remained the same (adjusted OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.40-1.11). Safe disposal of syringes did not differ significantly across the sampling periods (adjusted OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.84-2.06). Increased access to pharmacy syringes offers a first step at reducing HIV-related syringe practices but must be coupled with strong HIV prevention messages, drug treatment referrals, and safe syringe disposal options.

AB Drowning is the third leading cause of death from unintentional injuries in Louisiana. In 1998, the fatality rate from drowning for Louisiana residents was 3.1 per 100,000 population, higher than the U.S. rate of 1.9 per 100,000, and more than twice the 2000 national target of 1.3 per 100,000 population. This report describes the demographics and risk factors associated with drownings in Louisiana in 1998. Findings indicate that alcohol or illicit drug use was found in approximately 60% of tested victims aged > or = 13 years and that none of the victims of boating-related drowning were correctly wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). Prevention efforts should focus on decreasing alcohol and illicit drug use and increasing the proper use of PFDs among boaters and others involved in water recreation.

AB BACKGROUND: Drinking frequency escalates rapidly during adolescence. Abstinence declines markedly, and drinking monthly or more often becomes normative. Individual differences in adolescent drinking patterns are large, and some patterns are predictive of subsequent drinking problems; little, however, is known of the gene-environment interactions that create them.; METHODS: Five consecutive and complete birth cohorts of Finnish twins, born 1975-1979, were enrolled sequentially into a longitudinal study and assessed, with postal questionnaires, at ages 16, 17, and 18.5 years. The sample included 1786 same-sex twin pairs, of whom 1240 pairs were concordantly drinking at age 16. Maximum likelihood models were fit in longitudinal analyses of the three waves of drinking data to assess changes in genetic and environmental influences on alcohol use across adolescence. Secondary analyses contrasted twin pairs residing in rural versus those in urban environments to investigate gene-environment interactions.; RESULTS: Longitudinal analyses revealed that genetic factors influencing drinking patterns increased in importance across the 30-month period, and effects arising from common environmental influences declined. Distributions of drinking frequencies in twins residing in urban and rural environments were highly similar, but influences on drinking varied between the two environments. Genetic factors assumed a larger role among adolescents residing in urban areas, while common environmental influences were more important in rural settings. Formal modeling of the data established a significant gene-environment interaction.; CONCLUSIONS: The results document the changing impact of genetic and environmental influences on alcohol use across adolescence. Importantly, the results also reveal a significant gene-environment interaction in patterns of adolescent drinking and invite more detailed analyses of the pathways and mechanisms by which environments modulate genetic effects.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative contributions of substance abuse history and violent etiology to the prediction of outcomes for individuals who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) requiring inpatient rehabilitation.; DESIGN: Longitudinal study of outcomes 1 year postdischarge from rehabilitation.; SETTING: Specialized TBI acute rehabilitation unit.; PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred fifty-one individuals consecutively admitted for rehabilitation.; INTERVENTIONS: Gathered data from patients' medical records (including etiology of injury, initial Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and FIMtrade mark instrument scores at discharge), demographic details, and history of substance abuse; phone and mail survey data from individuals (Satisfaction with Life Scale [SWLS]; Community Integration Questionnaire [CIQ]).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CIQ and SWLS; relative contributions of injury etiology, demographic and injury-related dependent variables, and substance abuse history to predictive model.; RESULTS: Almost 80% of persons with injuries from violence-related causes had a history of substance abuse. Substance abuse was found to contribute to the prediction of life satisfacton and productivity, while violent etiology was not a significant contributor to predictive models.; CONCLUSION: Substance abuse history proved to be a strong predictor of long-term outcomes, while violent etiology of injury was less influential. The results of this study emphasize the need to include substance abuse history in all studies of outcomes after TBI, and to increase prevention efforts to limit the effects of such a history.

About 52% had smoked cigarettes, 25% had tried alcohol, 21% opium and 12% cannabis; only one student had used heroin. Those who had used drugs obtained them from and used them with friends or acquaintances. The majority of students wanted more information on drugs, and considered television and films the best medium for providing information. Drug use among Shiraz University students is still lower than that reported in the West (except opium). Drug prevention programmes relevant to Iranian culture should be devised.

AB OBJECTIVE: This article examines the relationship between prior problem behaviors and change in residence on alcohol use patterns among college students.; METHOD: Measures of alcohol consumption (e.g., drinking frequency, average consumption and frequency of heavy episodic drinking were related to residence patterns and prior problem behaviors (e.g., conduct problems. illicit substance involvement and early age at onset of alcohol consumption). Subjects (N = 2,465; 51% women) were a subsample drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Labor Market Experience in Youth. The analysis was conducted using a linear growth model for continuous outcomes with time-invariant and time-varying covariates for each of the drinking measures.; RESULTS: The results of the structural equation analysis yielded significant and direct effects related to residence patterns and prior problem behaviors. Problem behaviors were related to drinking measures; however, there was no evidence for a mediational hypothesis. Neither was there systematic evidence that the relationship between prior problem behavior and alcohol use was mediated by residence patterns. The analysis of change in residence was related to both time-specific and longer-term influences on alcohol use.; CONCLUSIONS: The presence of direct and independent effects for both dispositional and high-risk environmental factors in collegiate drinking practices support targeted and diverse strategies for prevention activities.

AB Important trends in research over the past decade indicate that women are as greatly affected by familial alcoholism as are men. Although it is increasingly recognized that the adverse drinking outcomes predicted for adult children of alcoholics (COAs) are not inevitable, and only a small percentage develop alcohol dependence or grow up to be alcoholic, relatively little knowledge exists regarding moderating factors that reduce their vulnerability. This study identifies a multiple mediator latent structural model of the intergenerational transmission of risk for DSM-IV-assessed alcohol abuse and dependence among women COAs in adulthood. The effects of both parental alcoholism and family environment are estimated at three time points spanning 10 years across 5-year intervals (1984, 1989, and 1994) using data from a subsample of 4,449 women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Dyadic cohesion in marital communication (greater marital cohesion, harmony, and less verbal disagreement, discord, and conflict) is a proposed moderating factor that may operate in adulthood to lower the risk of female COAs developing alcohol abuse and dependence. Maximum likelihood standardized estimates of the effects of alcohol mediators measured over time indicate that direct parental effects for adverse outcomes decline when COAs are in their late 20s and early 30s. Indirect parental effects through environmental influences dramatically increase the risk of abuse and dependence among COAs at this time if they have one or more alcoholic siblings, especially an alcoholic sister. Dyadic cohesion and positive interpersonal communication patterns were found to moderate effectively the relationship that existed among parental alcoholism, environmental influences, and adverse alcohol consequences. COAs with satisfactory marital communication also evidenced higher levels of intimacy with their partners, perceived the division of housework to be fairer, shared more responsibilities and burdens of the household, and had less conflict over critical domestic issues than other women COAs. The protective benefits of a good marriage against the risks of alcoholism remained when applied to younger and older subjects, across diverse backgrounds, and after adjusting for other factors such as employment status.

AB A social marketing campaign to change perceptions of peer drinking norms was conducted by the National Golden Key Honor Society at the University of Mississippi during the 1995-1996 school year. To assess the campaign's impact on perceptions of student drinking norms and alcohol consumption, Golden Key's national office administered a survey three times during the school year to all students enrolled in a random sample of required freshmen English courses. Regression analyses suggest that exposure to the marketing campaign may be associated with lower (and more accurate) estimates of student drinking norms. While offering promising results, this study was limited due to shortcomings in the research design. Future evaluations of social norms marketing campaigns should adhere to basic evaluation principles, such as using comparison groups, collecting contextual data, using a valid and reliable survey instrument, and ensuring proper survey administration techniques.

AB AIMS: To test the hypothesis that drug law enforcement encourages entry into methadone maintenance treatment.; DESIGN: Survey conducted as face-to-face interviews in methadone clinics, at needle exchange centres and on the street, in areas of widespread heroin dealing and use.; SETTING: Sydney, Australia.; PARTICIPANTS: Heroin users.; MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported data on personal characteristics, and experience of drug law enforcement and methadone maintenance treatment.; FINDINGS: Although keeping their relationship/family together emerged as the most important reason given by respondents for entering treatment, avoiding more trouble with police/courts was also rated by the majority of respondents as an important or very important reason for entering treatment. The results of logistic regression analysis show that, after controlling for other factors, heroin users who have had a friend or family member imprisoned are more likely to have tried methadone maintenance treatment. A heroin user's own experience of arrest and imprisonment was also found to increase the likelihood of having tried treatment but only when age and length of time as a regular user (which were related to the user's experience of arrest and imprisonment) were excluded from the set of control variables. Despite having extensive histories of contact with the police and criminal justice system, however, Asian, Middle Eastern and Aboriginal respondents showed less proclivity to enter treatment than Caucasian respondents.; CONCLUSION: Drug law enforcement may have a role to play in heroin demand reduction but its effects are not evident for all ethnic groups and the separate effects of contact with police, age and time spent in the heroin market remain unclear.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess young people's perceived messages in three ads for a vodka-based, pre-mixed alcohol beverage, and to assess the extent to which the ads appeared to be consistent with the industry's voluntary code.; METHOD: Members of two convenience samples of young people (15-16 and 19-21 years) were each exposed to one of three advertisements. Respondents completed a post exposure questionnaire based on standard advertising copy testing procedures.; RESULTS: The most frequently nominated open-ended responses to 'the main message(s) of the ad' related to the product delivering mood effects: both removal of negative emotions (e.g. 'stress reduction'), as well as inducing positive states such as feeling 'carefree' and gaining 'increased enjoyment'. Consumption of the product was perceived to offer 'self-confidence', 'sexual/relationship success' and 'social success'. Fewer respondents nominated tangible product characteristics, the main one being 'easy to drink'. One in four of the 15-16 year olds saw the ads as aimed at 'people my age', while almost half of the 19-21 year olds saw the ads as aimed at 'people younger or much younger than me'.; DISCUSSION: These results appear to contravene the Alcoholic Beverages Advertising Code (ABAC) by suggesting that the consumption of alcohol beverages: (i) contributes to social and sexual success; and (ii) contributes to a significant change in mood (stress reduction/relaxation).; IMPLICATIONS: Incidental observation of alcohol ads suggests that contravention of the code is more widespread than the number of alcohol advertising complaints would indicate. All 11 such complaints lodged with the Advertising Standards Board between May 1998 and April 1999 were dismissed. Evidence such as that gathered in this study might improve the chances of complaints being upheld.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in mental health service use and cost among privately insured children.; DATA SOURCES: Inpatient and outpatient claims from the MarketScan database, a collection of health care claims for a national sample of over seven million privately insured individuals. Claims were analyzed for all users of mental health services 17 years of age and under from 1993 to 1996.; STUDY DESIGN: The proportion of children receiving mental health services and annual costs and treatment days per treated child were compared across diagnostic groups over time.; PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The proportion of covered children receiving any mental health services fell substantially (-30.0 percent). Inpatient mental health costs per treated child fell $4,587 (-46.9 percent) during the period, driven by decreases in the number of hospital days per treated child per year (-22.9 percent) and per diem costs (-14.5 percent). Outpatient mental health costs also fell during the period due to a 5.1 percent decline in the number of treatment days and a 25.9 percent fall in costs per day. Children whose primary diagnosis was hyperactivity experienced the largest decrease in inpatient costs per treated patient, those diagnosed with schizophrenia experienced the smallest decrease, and those diagnosed with substance abuse disorders experienced large increases.; CONCLUSIONS: Changes in mental health service delivery have resulted in substantially reduced access to mental health care among children and significant declines in service use and costs among those who do receive services.

PS 572-86
PY 2001
PD 2001 Apr
AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of outbreaks and sporadic cases of viral hepatitis in tropical and subtropical countries but is infrequent in industrialized countries. The virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route with fecally contaminated drinking water being the usual vehicle. Hepatitis resulting from HEV infection is a moderately severe jaundice that is self-limiting in most patients. Young adults, 15 to 30 years of age, are the main targets of infection, and the overall death rate is 0.5 to 3.0%. However, the death rate during pregnancy approaches 15 to 25%. Death of the mother and fetus, abortion, premature delivery, or death of a live-born baby soon after birth are common complications of hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Hepatitis E virus is found in both wild and domestic animals; thus, HEV is a zoonotic virus. The viruses isolated from swine in the United States or Taiwan are closely related to human HEV found in those areas. The close genetic relationship of the swine and human virus suggests that swine may be a reservoir of HEV. In areas where swine are raised, swine manure could be a source of HEV contamination of irrigation water or coastal waters with concomitant contamination of produce or shellfish. Increasing globalization of food markets by industrialized countries has the potential of introducing HEV into new areas of the world. The purpose of this review is to cover certain aspects of hepatitis E including the causative agent, the disease, diagnosis, viral detection, viral transmission, epidemiology, populations targeted by HEV, and the role of animals as potential vectors of the virus.

AB One of the consequences of increased exposure to Western influences has been the spread of drug use among Nigerian young people over the last two decades. There is now a buoyant consumer market for home-grown cannabis, and a smaller market for heroin and cocaine within the country. Under successive military regimes, drug use was either downplayed, or regarded as a law enforcement issue. Little work was carried out to gauge the extent of use, or obtain an understanding of the user constituencies. Government policies are entirely informed by Western models and sadly inadequate in understanding Nigerian drug trends and in devising schemes to meet local needs. This article, by giving voice to Nigerian drug users, is an attempt to dispel some misconceptions about drug use and abuse, and to widen the debate surrounding African drug control. There is a grave danger of the war on drugs being exported to African countries where civil societies are weakest in withstanding the onslaught of government and international agencies. This article is therefore an ethnographic drugs study engaging with crucial development issues.

AB In Scotland during the mid 1990s the news media began reporting growing concern about a new form of alcoholic beverage known as 'alcopops'. Fears raised by the press centred on the claim that these drinks were being marketed towards young children and as such were responsible for the rising levels of adolescent drunkenness. In focusing on underage consumption and alleged marketing aimed at children, the press portrayed alcopops use as illicit, allowing these drinks to be reported as if they were an illegal drug. This 'negative' publicity was in contrast to the 'positive' stories and advertising space given over to other alcoholic beverages elsewhere in their pages. This manuscript quantifies the volume of reporting of these drinks in the Scottish press over the life-span of their news-worthiness. It argues that the press's claims could not be supported by the realities of underage drinking at the time. When this became apparent the scare story ended as rapidly as it had begun. Though concerning a licit substance these findings were found to have many illuminating parallels with illegal drug scare stories.

AB BACKGROUND: Alcohol-related injuries, particularly motor vehicle, are an important cause of adolescent mortality. School-based alcohol prevention programs have not been evaluated in terms of driving outcomes. This study examined the effects on subsequent driving of a high school-based alcohol prevention program.; METHODS: The Alcohol Misuse Prevention Study included a randomized test of the effectiveness of an alcohol misuse prevention curriculum conducted among 4,635 10th-grade students. Students were assigned to intervention (n = 1,820) or control (n = 2,815) groups and were followed for an average of 7.6 years after licensure, which typically occurred during or shortly after 10th grade. Outcomes examined included alcohol-related and other serious offenses, and at-fault, single-vehicle, and alcohol-related crashes.; RESULTS: Only serious offenses (which included alcohol-related) had a significant treatment effect (statistically marginal) after we adjusted for sex, age, race, alcohol use/misuse, family structure, presence of prelicense offenses, age of driver licensure, and parental attitudes toward teen drinking. The effect was found only during the first year of licensure (estimated adjusted relative risk = 0.80, confidence interval = 0.63-1.01). Two first-year serious offense interactions were found. The positive effect was strongest among the largest subgroup of students, those who were drinking less than one drink per week on average before the curriculum, compared with those who drank more than one drink per week (p = 0.009). The effect was also stronger for the small subgroup of students whose parents had not expressed disapproval of teens' drinking, compared with those whose parents had disapproved (p = 0.004).; CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a high school-based alcohol prevention program can positively affect subsequent driving, particularly that of students who do not use alcohol regularly. The results highlight the need to start prevention efforts early and extend them beyond the initial exposure to driving. Programs should incorporate the differing backgrounds of the students.

AB OBJECTIVE: This article examines the factor structure of 22 symptom items used to configure the criteria of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) alcohol abuse and dependence and relates the factor structure to background characteristics.; METHOD: Data for this study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Labor Market Experience in Youth (NLSY). The symptom items were related to the covariates using the statistical technique of structural equation modeling generalized to dichotomous outcomes. The present model is a special case of structural equation modeling, a multiple causes and multiple indicators (MIMIC) model, in which one or more latent variables (i.e., alcohol abuse and dependence) intervene between a set of observed background variables predicting a set of observed response variables (i.e., DSM-IV symptom items).; RESULTS: The results of the structural equation analysis provide further support for two dimensions underlying the DSM-IV symptom items. Although the two-factor dimension bore a strong resemblance to the DSM-IV conceptions of abuse and dependence, there were notable differences in the item content of the symptom items for each dimension. The dependence dimension drew upon items related to the abuse criteria for continued drinking despite social problems and recurrent drinking resulting in failure to fulfill role obligations. The abuse dimension drew upon items related to the abuse criterion for hazardous drinking and the dependence criterion for larger amounts over time. The two factors were shown to have different relationships to the background variables. Alcohol dependence was related to family history of alcoholism and educational status. Age was not related to dependence and inversely related to alcohol abuse.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study replicate the two-dimensional model for DSM-IV criteria found in other studies and provide further support for the validity of alcohol dependence in general population samples. A major implication of the factor structure in the present study relates to the different classification of cases that would otherwise be obtained with DSM-IV criteria. These departures were shown to affect abuse, which retained only 40% of DSM-IV diagnoses, more strongly than dependence, which retained 91% of DSM-IV diagnoses.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test a developmental model of drug use in male adolescents. The model postulates that low executive functioning and a difficult temperament are related to aggression and affiliations with delinquent peers which, in turn, are related to elevated drug use.; METHOD: Boys (N = 187) with and without a family history of a substance use disorder (SUD) were followed over a 6-year period. Executive functioning and temperament were measured at age 10-12, aggression and affiliations with delinquent peers were assessed at age 12-14 and drug use was measured at age 16.; RESULTS: Low executive functioning and a difficult temperament were related to increased aggression and affiliations with delinquent peers. These latter variables were related to increased drug use. Furthermore, the relation between difficult temperament and drug use was fully mediated by aggression and affiliations with delinquent peers.; CONCLUSIONS: Drug abuse prevention efforts may benefit from clinical interventions aimed at strengthening executive functioning, regulating temperament and improving socialization strategies in antisocial children.

AB This study sought to determine whether the well-established relation between fraternity/sorority (Greek) membership and heavy alcohol use persists beyond the college years and whether some common third variables might account for the relation between Greek status and heavy drinking. During each of 4 years of college and 1 additional year, young adults (N = 319) completed measures of alcohol use, personality, alcohol expectancies, and environmental influences on drinking. Throughout the college years, Greeks consistently drank more heavily than non-Greeks. Statistically controlling for previous alcohol use did not eliminate this effect. However, Greek status did not predict postcollege heavy drinking levels. Also, perceived peer norms for heavy drinking mediated the relation between Greek affiliation and heavy alcohol use. Results are discussed in terms of situational determinants of heavy alcohol involvement in young adults.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate whether adolescent contraceptive non-use is associated with other risk behaviors.; METHODS: A multistage sampling procedure produced a sample of 913 sexually active high school students. They completed a self-administered questionnaire that required mainly "yes" or "no" answers to questions involving participation in a range of risk behaviors. A series of multivariate logistic regression models investigated the relationships between contraceptive non-use and selected hypothesised correlates, controlling for key demographic variables.; RESULTS: Contraceptive non-use was not significantly associated with use of cigarettes, alcohol, or inhalants; perpetration or being a victim of violence; exposure to risk of physical injury; and suicidality. For males only, there was a significant inverse association between contraceptive non-use and use of cannabis in the previous month. This was not the case for lifetime cannabis use for either gender. There was a significant inverse relationship between contraceptive non-use and knowing the most recent partner for more than 7 days, but no association for the number of partners nor duration since the last intercourse. For females only, there was a significant inverse association between contraceptive non-use and both age and age of first intercourse.; CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the hypothesis that contraceptive non-use is a component of the "risk behavior syndrome." Decisions to participate in intercourse and to use contraception have different psychosocial foundations. Prevention efforts should prioritize relationships with new partners and younger girls who commence intercourse early.

AB BACKGROUND: A large epidemic of HIV-1 subtype B began among injection drug users (IDUs) in Bangkok in 1988. Despite ongoing prevention efforts, HIV-1 prevalence among IDUs remained at 30-50% through the 1990s.; OBJECTIVES: To measure the incidence of HIV-1 infection and related risk factors to guide prevention efforts and to evaluate the feasibility of conducting an HIV vaccine efficacy trial.; DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study in which IDUs attending methadone treatment programs in Bangkok were screened during 1995-1996 for enrollment into the study. IDUs found to be HIV-seronegative on two occasions were offered enrollment with follow-up visits every 4 months. On each visit participants were evaluated with a questionnaire and serologic testing.; RESULTS: A total of 1209 HIV-negative IDUs were enrolled. Through the end of 1998, the overall HIV-1 incidence rate was 5.8 (95% confidence interval, 4.8-6.8) per 100 person-years of follow-up. HIV-1 subtypes E and B accounted for 79 and 21% of infections, respectively. On multivariate analysis, HIV-1 seroconversion was primarily associated with the frequency of heroin injection, the sharing of injection equipment, and incarceration, especially with drug injection. Sexual behavior was not associated with increased risk for HIV-1. Risk factors for infection with HIV-1 subtypes E and B were similar.; CONCLUSION: HIV-1 transmission risk remains high among Bangkok IDUs despite methadone treatment and other current prevention strategies. There is an urgent need to address this ongoing epidemic, especially in jails and prisons. This study led to the initiation in 1999 of a phase III HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trial in this population.

AB Public health social marketing campaigns have targeted adults to prevent drinking and driving, smoking, and human immunodeficiency virus transmission; however, adults have not been targeted for prevention of child sexual abuse. In Vermont, STOP IT NOW! addresses child sexual abuse systematically as a public health issue by using social marketing and public education to emphasize the responsibility of adults for prevention. As one component of STOP IT NOW!, Vermont sex offender treatment providers and state attorneys' offices were surveyed in September 1997 to assess self-reported abuse by adults and adolescents. This report summarizes the results of the survey, which indicate that some adults who abuse will turn themselves in voluntarily for treatment despite mandated reporting to the legal system, and some parents will intervene to seek help for their children who have sexual behavior problems even without a victim's report. Continued studies are needed to evaluate this approach to preventing child sexual abuse.

The students' use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, and other illicit drugs were compared, because these vary by gender, country, and their age of first drug use and are influenced by demographic variables, individual characteristics, and environmental influences. More BCN students than LA students had used alcohol, but more LA than BCN students had used illicit drugs and initiated drug use earlier. When demographic variables were influential, they were most powerful and increased the risk for drug use more than environmental factors or individual characteristics. Environmental factors were most influential for boys' drug use, whereas environmental and demographic variables were most influential for girls' drug use.

The Community Readiness Survey was designed through a series of prevention practitioner and consultant meetings and focus groups. Psychometric evaluation revealed five distinct domains: perception of alcohol, tobacco, or other drug problem; support for prevention; permissive attitudes toward teen substance use; perception of adolescent access; and perception of community commitment. Evidence of construct validity was demonstrated by the small but significant relationships between selected scale scores and community readiness as evaluated by prevention planners.

AB Social influences can promote or discourage adolescent substance use. The authors surveyed 4,263 sixth- to eighth-grade students to assess the effect of peer and parent influences on adolescent substance use. The authors conducted separate multiple logistic regression analyses for smoking and drinking, controlling for grade, sex, and race. Positive independent associations with smoking and drinking were found for direct peer pressure and associating with problem-behaving friends. Independent negative associations with smoking and drinking were also found for parent involvement, parent expectations, and parent regard. In an analysis of interactions, peer pressure was positively associated with drinking for girls but not for boys and problem-behaving friends was positively associated with drinking for both boys and girls. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that associating with deviant peers promotes and that authoritative parenting protects against smoking and drinking.

Data from two studies of IDUs conducted from 1992 through 1995 and 1998 through 1999 in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and East Harlem, New York, were examined to assess trends over this period. Separate analyses were conducted for IDUs who were current crack smokers. Significant decreasing trends in seroprevalence were found among IDUs in the New York and Puerto Rico samples (p <.001). Significant decreasing trends in receptive and distributive needle sharing were found in the New York sample, and a significant decline in receptive sharing was found in the Puerto Rico sample. Overall, higher levels of needle-sharing behaviors were reported in Puerto Rico compared with New York. Decreasing trends in needle sharing and seroprevalence in both communities are an encouraging finding. Ongoing epidemiologic studies to monitor the epidemic and continued prevention efforts to help maintain or further these declines are needed, particularly to address the higher rates of needle sharing in Puerto Rico.

AB The quantity, frequency, and variability of alcohol and other substance use is described in a random sample of 1,436 enrolled members of four tribes from the northern United States. Overall, males begin regular drinking at an earlier age than do females (17 vs. 18.1 years), and more males drink alcohol than females (70.7% to 60.4%). There are some very heavy drinkers who drink daily in these populations, but most drinkers are binge drinkers. On any typical day abstinence from alcohol is the modal pattern. That is, most respondents indicated very infrequent drinking, and among the older age groups (40+), there is a high rate of abstinence. Males drink more frequently and in larger quantities than females. The number of drinking days per month is 4.7 for males and 2.1 for females, and on those days when drinking occurs, the males consume an average of 5.7 drinks and females an average of 3.1. The highest prevalence of drinking and the heaviest drinking occur among those who are under the age of 30. With the exception of tobacco use, which is high in all age categories, the use of other drugs is highest in those under 30.

During Phase 1, a single brand name was provided; for Phase 2, assorted brand names were added. Number of condoms taken was recorded for each phase.; RESULTS: For one clinic there was nearly a two-fold increase in number of condoms taken (Phase 1 to Phase 2); for the second clinic there was negligible difference in number of condoms taken.; CONCLUSIONS: The provision of assorted brand name condoms, over a single brand name, can serve to increase condom acquisition. Locations of condoms and target population characteristics are related factors.

AB This is the first report of the Twin Mom Study, an investigation of three hypotheses concerning influences on maternal adjustment. These hypotheses concern the role of the marital and parent-child relationships in mediating genetic influences on maternal adjustment and on the importance of the mothers' marital partners as a specifiable source of influences on their adjustment not shared with their sisters. The study's sample of 150 monozygotic (MZ) twins and 176 dizygotic (DZ) twins was drawn randomly from the Swedish Twin Registry and is, with some small exceptions, likely to be representative of women in the Swedish population. The sample included the marital partners of these twins and their adolescent children. Self-report and coded videotapes were a source of information about family process. Results reported in this first report focus on comparability of American and Swedish samples on scales measuring psychiatric symptoms, and on an analysis of genetic and environmental influences on nine measures of mothers' adjustment. Results suggest comparability between the US and Sweden. Genetic influences were found for all measures of adjustment, particularly in the psychological manifestations of anxiety and for smoking. The pattern of findings also underscored the importance of influences unique to each sibling within the twin pair, thus focusing attention on the potential role of marital partners in maternal adjustment. Results also suggested that experiences shared by the twin sisters, experiences unrelated to their genetic similarity, may influence their fearfulness and alcohol consumption. Our model did not include these influences and thus must be amended.

In 1994, the odds of alcohol abuse increased by 7.0% with each decreasing year of age at drinking onset, while age at drinking onset was not related to alcohol abuse in 1989. Several other risk factors were found to be strong and consistent predictors of abuse and dependence in 1989 and 1994, including being male, divorced, separated or never married, younger, and having an early history antisocial behaviors and marijuana use.; IMPLICATIONS: Implications of the results of this study are discussed in terms of other factors that may impact on the onset-abuse and onset-dependence relationship and the need to focus future prevention efforts.

AB PURPOSE: This study examines heavy episodic alcohol consumption and associated harms in collegiate athletes in the United States. The factors which may promote or deter such use are explored.; METHODS: Randomly selected students in a nationally representative sample of 4-yr colleges in the United States completed self-report questionnaires in the spring of 1997. Athletes were defined as students who participated in one or more hours of intercollegiate athletics per day. Heavy episodic or "binge" drinking for men was defined as consuming five or more alcoholic drinks on at least one occasion in the past 2 wk and four or more for women. Athletes were compared with other students at their colleges.; RESULTS: Athletes reported more binge drinking, heavier alcohol use, and a greater number of drinking-related harms. Athletes are more likely to exhibit the strong social ties found to be associated with binge drinking. Athletes, despite drinking more heavily than other students, report greater exposure to alcohol prevention efforts and possess unique motivations to limit their alcohol use.; CONCLUSIONS: Athletes are a high-risk group for binge drinking and alcohol-related harms. Although special educational programs have targeted this group they have not sufficiently impacted the problem. Future prevention efforts targeted for athletes should address the unique social and environmental influences on athletes. Programs should also take advantage of motives of athletes for self-limiting alcohol intake. Colleges, athletic departments, coaches, and sports medicine professionals are urged to act to help reduce athletes risk of alcohol-related harms.

AB In this Monograph, we report the follow-up of 570 adolescents who had been studied as preschoolers in one of two separate investigations of television use. The primary goal of the study was to determine the long-term relations between preschool television viewing and adolescent achievement, behavior, and attitudes. Using a telephone interview and high school transcripts, we assessed adolescent media use; grades in English, science, and math; leisure reading; creativity; aggression; participation in extracurricular activities; use of alcohol and cigarettes; and self-image. In each domain, we tested theories emphasizing the causal role of television content (e.g., social learning, information processing) as contrasted with those theories positing effects of television as a medium, irrespective of content (e.g., time displacement, pacing, interference with language). The results provided much stronger support for content-based hypotheses than for theories emphasizing television as a medium; moreover, the patterns differed for boys and girls. Viewing educational programs as preschoolers was associated with higher grades, reading more books, placing more value on achievement, greater creativity, and less aggression. These associations were more consistent for boys than for girls. By contrast, the girls who were more frequent preschool viewers of violent programs had lower grades than those who were infrequent viewers. These associations held true after taking into account family background, other categories of preschool viewing, and adolescent media use. One hypothesis accounting for the sex differences is that early experiences, such as television viewing, have greater effects when they counteract normative developmental trends and predominant sex-typed socialization influences than when they reinforce them. Adolescents in the study used both television and print media to support ongoing interests. Television content (e.g., entertainment, sports, or world events) predicted extracurricular activities, role models, and body image. The only evidence for possible effects of television as a medium was the positive relation of total viewing to obesity for girls. The medium of television is not homogeneous or monolithic, and content viewed is more important than raw amount. The medium is not the message: The message is.

AB OBJECTIVE: Substantial research has associated exposure to entertainment media with increased levels of interpersonal violence, risky sexual behavior, body image distortion, substance abuse, and obesity. The objective of this study was to determine what pediatric residency programs are teaching trainees about media and the influence of media on the physical and mental health of children and adolescents.; DESIGN: Survey of residency curricula, consisting of 17 items about children's exposure to media, including television, movies, popular music, computer/video games and the Internet, the effects of this exposure on specific health risks, and associations between program characteristics and media education in the residency curriculum. Participants. Directors of the 209 accredited pediatric residency programs in the United States.; RESULTS: Two hundred four programs (97.6%) responded. Fifty-eight programs (28.4%) offered formal education on 1 or more types of media; 60 programs (29.4%) discussed the influences of media when teaching about specific health conditions. Residents in 96 programs (47.1%) were encouraged to discuss media use with patients and parents; 13 programs (6.4%) taught media literacy as an intervention. Among program characteristics, only media training received by program directors was significantly associated with inclusion of media in residency curricula.; CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing awareness of media influence on child health, less than one-third of US pediatric residency programs teach about media exposure. Developing a pediatric media curriculum and training pediatric residency directors or designated faculty may be a resource-effective means of improving health for children growing up in a media-saturated environment.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent to which demographic, sexual, and non-injection drug use practices predict adolescent initiation of injection drug use.; METHODS: Street recruited injection drug users 15-30 years of age in Baltimore, Maryland, who initiated injection within five years of study enrollment, completed a questionnaire that included a year-by-year history regarding the five years prior to initiation of injection. Factors associated with initiation during adolescence (< or = 21 years of age) versus young adulthood (>21 ) were determined using logistic regression.; RESULTS: Of 226 participants, most were female (61%) and African American (64%). Median age of participants was 25; median age at initiation of injection was 23. Factors significantly associated with adolescent initiation in multivariate analysis included race other than African American, and practices prior to initiating injection including condom use, lack of cocaine use, exclusive crack smoking just prior to initiation, and smoking marijuana. Adolescent initiates also had shorter durations of illicit drug use prior to initiating injection.; CONCLUSION: Short-term non-injection drug use, particularly exclusive crack smoking, was associated with adolescent initiation of injection drug use. Early prevention efforts targeting this high-risk group of younger drug users are warranted in order to delay or prevent onset of injection drug use.

AB Trends in cigarette use among students in grades 7-12 in the Madison Metropolitan School District were examined using data from the Dane County Youth Survey, which has been conducted every 5 years since 1980. Past year use of smoking tobacco among these students declined from 40% to 45% through 1995 to 32% in 2000. Past month cigarette use declined from 27% in 1995 to 18% in 2000; daily smoking dropped from 15% in 1990 to 8% in 2000. Among 12th grade students, 1999 national data show that 35% smoked in the past month, compared to 30% of Madison 12th graders. Bivariate analyses show significant socio-economic and race/ethnic disparities in cigarette smoking rates. Hispanic, Native American and white students reported higher rates of smoking than Asian and African American students. Students whose parents had more education were less likely to smoke, as were those students who themselves were academically successful and who had college plans. Students who smoked were far more likely than non-smokers to engage in other risky behaviors, including use of alcohol and marijuana, and to be sexually active. Parental monitoring and supervision, support in one's neighborhood, and participation in volunteer and leadership activities were associated with lower rates of smoking. Risk factors associated with increased rates of smoking included other drug use, aggressive behavior, less family disapproval of risky behavior, and self-concerns about one's own behaviors. These data can assist in targeting prevention and cessation efforts for Wisconsin adolescents. Physicians and other care providers should consider cigarette smoking as a sentinel event that signals the need for screening for potential substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and contraceptive care. School-based preventive efforts should be continued, particularly at the middle school level, with cessation programs added at the high school level.

AB Twin studies have yielded contradictory findings about sex differences in genetic influences on the etiology of alcoholism. Studies based on population registers or epidemiological samples have yielded similar estimates of heritability (50-60% of the total variance) for males and females. In contrast, studies of twins identified through treatment settings have found sizeable genetic contributions to alcoholism in males but usually negligible heritabilities for females. We investigated this discrepancy by applying a "simulated" treatment ascertainment strategy to data on alcohol-related disorders collected by structured interviews with a population-based sample of adult twins aged 18-56 years from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. Structural models were used to estimate heritabilities for two definitions of treatment, and these estimates were compared with those obtained from the population-based sample. In males, heritability estimates were similar across sampling methods, but the treatment ascertainment methods yielded higher estimates of common environmental influences. For females, heritability estimates based on a broad definition of treatment were similar to those obtained by using the random ascertainment design. However, estimates based on sampling women who had been in alcohol-treatment programs were (nonsignificantly) lower than those obtained with the other methods. These results provide partial support for the hypothesis that differences in sampling method may account for differences in heritability estimates for alcoholism among studies of female twins. Am. J.

AB Finland's participation in the European Union has meant that Finnish markets have been opened to international competition and that the traditional alcohol policy decision-making that revolved around Alko, the state alcohol monopoly company, has become impossible. The influence of private commercial interests increased in the 1990s but not in a straightforward manner. They had their biggest influence in the mid-1990s when the 1994 Alcohol Act was drafted and accepted. After that the influence of commercial interests has declined, and nowadays the alcohol question is again discussed in terms of public health and safety and drinking among young people. Integration did not lead to the expected deregulation of alcohol control but to new forms of regulation, where EU authorities such as the Commission and the EU Court also play an important role. Alcohol policy-making is now more transparent, and free trade and competition without interference are much more stressed than previously. These are the new frames of public intervention in the alcohol question, both in the trade of alcoholic beverages and in the taking care of individuals harmed by the use of alcohol.

AB This paper focuses on the marketing of alcohol to young people in the United Kingdom, but the lessons that emerge have international significance. Alcohol is a global enterprise and recent consolidation means that it is controlled by a decreasing number of expanding multi-nationals. Alcohol companies are able to allocate significant resources to researching consumer preferences, developing new products and promoting them on an international level. Recent years have seen a growth in the value that youth culture attaches to brand labels and symbols and a move away from the healthy-living ethos. The alcohol industry's response to these trends has been to design alcoholic beverages that appeal to young people, using well-informed and precisely targeted marketing strategies. This has led to growing concerns about the implications for public health and a demand for tighter controls to regulate alcohol marketing practices. In the United Kingdom, controls on alcohol are piecemeal and reactive and the current system of voluntary regulation appears ineffective. This paper argues for more research to establish current industry practice and inform the development of a comprehensive regulatory structure and system of monitoring.

AB This paper describes the introduction of alcopops and sweet ciders in Sweden in 1996, as a result of the membership of the European Union. Special attention is given to its effect on youth drinking. Surveys of young people show that alcopops and sweet ciders are perceived to be easy to drink and to have a sweet and pleasant taste, which tends to conceal the taste of alcohol. These results suggest that alcopops and sweet ciders should be regarded as one category of drinks. Alcopops and sweet ciders have penetrated the youth market rapidly. The introduction of these beverages accounted for approximately half of the increase in alcohol consumption by 15-16-year-old boys from 1996 to 1999, and two-thirds of the increase among girls, according to the surveys. A large proportion of the youth answered that alcopops and ciders did not replace any other alcoholic beverage. The paper also describes the public debate on alcopops and cider. The introduction of alcopops was criticized by the media and the responsible minister. Prominent spokesmen of the alcohol industry put themselves at a distance from these, primarily imported, products. The sales of alcopops have been declining since 1997. Sweet ciders, on the other hand, which in reality are synonymous with alcopops, have continued to increase during the whole period since 1996, and have not been subject to the same public criticism.

AB Over 8,000 adolescents and young adults (4,111 males; 4,085 females) reported on several HIV-related risk behaviors during enrollment into 10 service demonstration projects targeted to youth living with, or at risk for, HIV. Distinct risk patterns emerged by gender when predicting HIV serostatus (versus unknown serostatus/negative serostatus). Males who had injection drug risk histories, had sex with an HIV positive partner, had sexually transmitted diseases, had sex with males, and/or were homeless had an inflated risk of being HIV positive. Females who engaged in sex with an HIV partner, had sex with an injection drug user, and/or had sexually transmitted diseases, were at the highest HIV risk. For both samples, engaging in sex with women reduced the likelihood of HIV positive status. Very basic information about risk factors obtained at service intake offers important information about HIV status of "high risk" youth presenting for care in community programs, as well as suggests clear risk factors for targeted preventive efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: One factor contributing to the 3- to 5-fold increase in risk for substance use disorders (SUDs) among children of alcoholics may be the rearing environment. These influences may include availability of substances, modeling of SUDs, inadequate parenting, or other factors. The contribution of parental environmental influences on offspring with SUDs may be estimated independently of genetic influences through assessment of adoptees raised by nonbiological parents.; METHODS: Relative risk of SUDs was assessed in adult adoptees (N = 442) of alcoholic and nonalcoholic adoptive parents as well as in stepchildren (N = 1859) with alcoholic or nonalcoholic stepfathers who participated in the community-based National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES).; RESULTS: Rearing by an alcoholic adoptive mother was associated with increased DSM-IV alcohol abuse. Rearing by an alcoholic adoptive father was predictive of adoptees' illicit drug use, as well as DSM-IV drug dependence. Rearing by an alcoholic stepfather was predictive of stepchild DSM-IV alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, and drug dependence, whereas an alcoholic stepmother was associated with increased illicit drug use in the stepchild. Alcoholism in adoptive parents or step parents did not increase risk for offspring DSM-IV alcohol dependence. In both adoptive and biological families, there was a subadditive interaction of mother by father alcoholism such that the rate of substance abuse when both parents were alcoholic was less than that expected based on the additive effects of each alcoholic parent.; CONCLUSIONS: Rearing by an alcoholic parent had a greater influence on alcohol abuse by offspring than on alcohol dependence. The increased risk of proband illicit drug use and drug dependence associated with paternal alcoholism suggested nonspecificity of environmental transmission. Both maternal and paternal cultural transmission effects influenced offspring SUDs.

AB The Campuswide Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Program (CADAPP) was implemented and evaluated over a 1.5-year span at the University of New Mexico (UNM). Drawing on self-regulation theory as a basis for understanding motivation for change, the program was designed to increase risk perceptions and thereby reduce the use of alcohol and other drugs among university students. The program was evaluated from 1988 to 1989 through repeated anonymous random sample surveys of all enrolled students on the UNM campus and on a similar control campus not implementing new prevention efforts during the same period. As predicted, relative to the control campus, students on the CADAPP campus after the program showed significantly higher perceived risks from substance use and significantly reduced levels of alcohol and marijuana use. These findings provide encouraging evidence for this theory-based approach to primary and secondary prevention.

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe epidemiologic patterns and trends in HIV infection in Vietnam from 1996 through 1999, and to summarize the national response to the epidemic.; METHODS: We reviewed nationwide HIV case reports, and we analyzed annual seroprevalence among different sentinel populations in 21 provinces, using the chi2 test for linear trend to assess trends in HIV prevalence. HIV prevention efforts were also reviewed.; RESULTS: Through 1999, 17,046 HIV infections, including 2947 AIDS cases and 1523 deaths had been reported in Vietnam. The cumulative incidence rate for the country was 22.5 per 100,000 population. Injection drug users (IDUs) represented 89.0% of all those for whom risk was reported before 1997 and 88.0% in the period 1997 to 1999. In 1999, HIV prevalence rates among IDUs ranged by province from 0% to 89.4%. Significantly increasing HIV trends among IDUs (p <.05) were found in 14 of the 21 sentinel provinces during 1996 to 1999. HIV prevalence among commercial sex workers (CSWs) ranged from 0% to 13.2%, increased significantly in 6 of 21 provinces. In 1999, prevalence among pregnant women, blood donors, and military recruits were 0.12%, 0. 20% and 0.61%, respectively. Major prevention activities include mass information; peer education and outreach among groups at increased risk; availability of low-cost syringes and condoms through pharmacies; needle exchange pilot projects; widely available treatment for sexually transmitted diseases; antibody screening of blood for transfusion; and free medical treatment at government hospitals.; DISCUSSION: The HIV epidemic continues to evolve rapidly, intensifying among IDUs and increasing among CSWs. Serosurveillance indicators of HIV in the population at large continue to indicate the relatively slow extension beyond those at highest risk. Immediate, intensive preventions in high-risk groups may decelerate expansion to the broader population.

AB OBJECTIVE: We present baseline sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence rates from an ongoing intervention trial at Kenyan agricultural sites.; METHODS: After gaining the cooperation of management, we identified six matched pairs of tea, coffee, and flower plantations and enrolled approximately 160 women at each site. Six intervention sites received an information programme and distributed female and male condoms, while six control sites received male condoms only and similar information about them. At clinic visits, we tested participants for cervical gonorrhoea (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) by ligase chain reaction on urine specimens, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) by culture. The study has 80% power to detect a 10% prevalence difference during follow up, assuming a combined STD prevalence of 20%, 25% loss to follow up and intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03.; RESULTS: Participants at intervention and control sites (total 1929) were similar at baseline. Mean age was 33 years, the majority were married, more than half currently used family planning, 78% had never used male condoms, and 9% reported more than one sexual partner in the 3 months before the study. Prevalences of GC, CT, and TV were 2.6%, 3.2%, and 20.4% respectively (23.9% overall), and were similar at intervention and control sites. The ICC for STD prevalence was 0.0011. Baseline STD was associated with unmarried status, non-use of family planning, alcohol use, and more than one recent sexual partner, but the highest odds ratio was 1.5.; CONCLUSIONS: Baseline results confirm a high prevalence of trichomoniasis and bacterial STD at these Kenyan rural sites. Improved STD management is urgently needed there. Our ongoing female condom intervention trial is feasible as designed.

AB Despite advances in characterizing human genotypes, the complex process through which genes exert their influence limits the application of molecular genetics to human diseases. Substance use disorders are necessarily complicated by gene-environment interaction because exposure to an exogenous substance is required for their development. The methods of genetic epidemiology are specifically designed to identify sources of complexity that impede etiologic findings and prevention efforts. The goal of this paper is to illustrate the application of family study methods to identify risk factors for substance abuse and their implications for prevention. The Yale Family Study is a controlled family study of the comorbidity of substance and psychiatric disorders. The sample consists of 223 probands with substance use and/or an anxiety disorders and community controls, 1218 adult first degree relatives and spouses, and 203 offspring (ages 7-17) followed for 8 years. Results indicated familial aggregation of substance disorders in adults and children, independence of familial aggregation of alcoholism and drug dependence, and specificity of familial clustering of some drugs of abuse. Familial factors are more strongly associated with substance dependence than abuse, with an attributable risk of 55%. Premorbid psychiatric disorders--social phobia and bipolar affective disorder in adults, and depression, anxiety, conduct, and oppositional defiant disorders in children--were strongly associated with the subsequent development of substance dependence (attributable risks ranging from 44 to 86%). A family history of substance abuse and premorbid psychopathology are strongly associated with the development of substance use disorders. Implications for primary and secondary prevention are discussed. As specific genetic vulnerability markers for substance use disorders become identified, application of the tools of genetic epidemiology may be employed to identify specific environmental risk factors that may serve as targets for prevention.

AB Both molecular genetic factors (the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) and the D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4) polymorphisms) and environmental influences of living in an alcoholic or nonalcoholic home on the personality traits of Extraversion and Neuroticism were assessed in drug-naive, young adolescent boys. There were no significant main effects of genetic or environmental factors on either Neuroticism or Extraversion as measured by the Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory (JEPI). However, a significant interaction between DRD2 (but not DRD4) alleles and environmental variables was observed on Extraversion. Specifically, children with the minor alleles of the DRD2 gene showed a significantly greater Extraversion score when living in an alcoholic than in a nonalcoholic home. In contrast, children with the major alleles of the DRD2 gene showed a trend in the opposite direction. Although the results are preliminary and pending replication, they nevertheless provide the first report of a specific gene-environment interaction involving a human personality trait.

AB OBJECTIVE: School- and community-based alcohol prevention programs are often evaluated using a group-randomized trial (GRT) design with a single pretest and a single posttest survey. To size such studies properly, investigators need accurate estimates of the variance and intraclass correlation that will be operative in their analyses. Until recently, the only available estimates were based on cross-sectional analyses. A recent report suggests that values from cross-sectional analyses may overestimate the intraclass correlation operative in pretest-posttest analyses. The purpose of this article is to review these issues, present estimates of intraclass correlation for a variety of alcohol-related endpoints based on cross-sectional analyses and to compare those estimates to estimates based on pretest-posttest analyses. We will also show how these estimates can be used to establish optimal sample sizes for GRTs to evaluate school- and community-based alcohol prevention programs.; METHOD: Data were collected from 18 to 20 year olds and high-school seniors as part of an alcohol prevention effort employing a group-randomized trial design with a single pretest and a single posttest survey. Data were analyzed via mixed-model regression methods to estimate components of variance. Those components were then used to compute the intraclass correlations operative in both cross-sectional analyses and in pretest-posttest analyses.; RESULTS: Results indicate that intraclass correlations operative in pretest-posttest analyses are much smaller than are those operative in cross-sectional analyses.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that future alcohol-prevention studies employing a group-randomized trial design with a single pretest and single posttest survey may not need to be as large as previously suggested by intraclass correlation estimates based on cross-sectional data. This holds true even if they are analyzed to reflect the extra variation typical of group-randomized trials.

AB The Great Patent Medicine Era (1865-1907) was the golden age of secret remedies--quack, non-prescription medicinal products, sold over-the-counter. Making outrageous and unsubstantiated claims, the makers of dental nostrums purported to effectively treat stained teeth, bad breath, diseased gums, toothache and teething discomfort. No proof was required to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of these concoctions. Advertisements for patent medicines were widespread, appearing in newspapers, almanacs, magazines, trade cards and multiple other media forms. Many dental patent medicines contained acids, abrasive substances, alcohol and/or narcotics, such as heroin, cocaine and morphine. Sozodont Tooth Powder, the most widely promoted and successful dentifrice of this era, claimed to "harden and invigorate the gums, purify and perfume the breath and beautify and preserve the teeth from youth to old age." Early dental researchers found that this remedy contained harsh ingredients (such as acid, sharp abrasives and astringents) which could destroy tooth substance. Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, an extremely popular dental nostrum, was intended to quiet a fretful child during the teething process. However, it contained generous levels of alcohol and morphine sulfate which could cause coma, addiction or death in an infant. Although somewhat chemically altered, these two products were eventually removed from the market in the 1930s.

AB Health-related lifestyles (smoking, drinking alcohol, exercise and diet) and feelings of alienation (powerlessness and hopelessness) of the citizens of Helsinki and Moscow are examined and discussed in a framework of life chances and life choices. The data were collected by a postal survey of 18-64 yr old citizens of Helsinki (N = 824) and Moscow (N = 545) in 1991. Almost all respondents in both cities used alcohol, but heavy drinking was more frequently reported in Helsinki. Muscovite men were smokers more often and Muscovite women less often than their counterparts in Helsinki. Nearly half of the Muscovites, but less than one-fifth of the Helsinki respondents considered their diet unhealthy or of poor quality. Regular exercise was much more common among the Finns compared to the Muscovites. The sex difference in health-related lifestyles was wider in Moscow than in Helsinki, especially concerning health-damaging behaviour. Feelings of alienation were more pronounced in Moscow. In both cities alienation was more clearly associated with socioeconomic life chance factors than with lifestyle factors. In Helsinki feelings of alienation had stronger associations both with health and health related lifestyles, which possibly points to a conventional stratification effect of a market-based class society. In Moscow, which represents a more traditional community, alienation seemed to be part of a widely felt general discontent. Health was a highly salient value in both cities, especially among women. In Helsinki a high valuation of health was connected with less smoking, more exercise and a healthier diet. Valuing health did not seem to emerge as a distinct healthy lifestyle in Moscow where behavioural choices were limited by many material constraints.

AB In an earlier paper, the author identified the role of maternal social characteristics on child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa through statistical analysis (Iyun, 1992; GeoJournal, 26(1), 43-52). This follow-up analysis attempts to further analyze and determine the relative significance of environmental and maternal factors on childhood mortality in two contrasting towns in southwestern Nigeria. The research design takes advantage of the integration of the medical and social sciences. The results of the current analysis reveal interesting insights into child mortality and maternal factors on one hand and domestic environmental conditions on the other. They give credence to an ecological perspective as a way to understand the complexities behind child survival. Domestic environmental conditions were stronger predictors of child mortality in the more developed study town, Ota, than the more traditional town, Iseyin. However, in both sites maternal factors, in particular age of mother at marriage, age of mother at first childbirth and parity were statistically significant predictors of child mortality. Mother's education was only significant in the more urbanized center, and generally remains inconsistent in its relationship with child mortality. Furthermore, child mortality rates continued to be a function of an environmental factor, namely source of drinking water, and a child care behavior factor, where the child was kept when mother was at work, especially the market environment.

AB Models of program development have primarily focused on the internal organizational processes needed to plan, implement, and evaluate new service programs. However, creating an external demand for new programs by policy makers, administrative bureaucracies, public health officials, and funders is critical to establishing new programs. A series of deaths of seropositive youth and an absence of local service settings with staff trained to address the needs of youth living with HIV provided the impetus for Larkin Street Youth Center. In particular, the agency had to overcome stigma associated with having both substance use and mental health disorders to establish service programs to recruit and mobilize staff within the agency and the local community and to establish a comprehensive housing program for symptomatic HIV-infected adolescents. This article examines how a residential assisted care facility for HIV-seropositive adolescents was established using organizational strategic planning processes, problem solving, and social marketing frameworks.

AB The inheritance of substance use and abuse among adolescents was investigated in a sample of 626 male and female 17-year-old twin pairs. Both licit (tobacco) and illicit (e.g., marijuana, amphetamines) substance use and abuse was assessed and analyzed using standard biometric methods. The heritability of use and abuse of illicit substances was modest (25% or less), whereas the heritability of tobacco use and nicotine dependence was substantial (40% to 60%). There was no evidence that gender moderated the strength of genetic influences. Shared environmental influences were substantial for all substance use measures. The finding of greater genetic influence on the use and abuse of a licit substance than on the use and abuse of illicit substances suggests that inherited risk to drug abuse is considerably moderated by environmental control, at least in adolescence. The finding of significant environmental influences on all substance use measures underscores the importance of intervention on early adolescent substance use, a known predictor of adult substance abuse and dependence.

AB Comorbidity among childhood disruptive behavioral disorders is commonly reported in both epidemiologic and clinical studies. These problems are also associated with early substance use and other markers of behavioral disinhibition. Previous twin research has suggested that much of the covariation between antisocial behavior and alcohol dependence is due to common genetic influences. Similar results have been reported for conduct problems and hyperactivity. For the present study, an adolescent sample consisting of 172 MZ and 162 DZ twin pairs, recruited through the Colorado Twin Registry and the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study were assessed using standardized psychiatric interviews and personality assessments. DSM-IV symptom counts for conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, along with a measure of substance experimentation and novelty seeking, were used as indices of a latent behavioral disinhibition trait. A confirmatory factor model fit to individual-level data showed a strong common factor accounting for 16-42% of the observed variance in each measure. A common pathway model evaluating the genetic and environmental architecture of the latent phenotype suggested that behavioral disinhibition is highly heritable (a(2) = 0.84), and is not influenced significantly by shared environmental factors. A residual correlation between conduct disorder and substance experimentation was explained by shared environmental effects, and a residual correlation between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and novelty seeking was accounted for by genetic dominance. These results suggest that a variety of adolescent problem behaviors may share a common underlying genetic risk.

AB AIMS: To investigate the importance of individual competences and risk factors at the age of 18 for future risk of substance misuse. Both behavioural and home-background risk factors were studied.; DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: The study group consisted of 7577 18-year-old Swedish conscripts followed for substance misuse up to the age of 36. Information on competence and risk factors was obtained from a survey at conscription. Records of drug use were obtained from official registers; 158 (2%) people were identified as serious adult substance misusers.; FINDINGS: Good emotional control and cognitive and social capacity were significantly associated with reduced risk of adult drug use whereas early contact with the police or juvenile authorities and alcohol misuse were the most powerful predictors for increased risk of adult drug misuse in multivariate analyses. The proportion of registered adult drug misuse in conscripts with multiple behavioural risk factors was 13.3% in those with drug experiences in late adolescence, compared with 2.6% in those with no earlier drug-experiences. Subjects with multiple behavioural and home-background risk factors but more than one competence were less likely to develop future substance misuse than those with only one or no competence factor. When analysed in relation to behavioural risks, competence factors are most effective in reducing drug use among subjects belonging to the high-risk category, whereas when analysed in relation to home-background risks personal competences are effective in low, medium and high-risk groups.; CONCLUSION: Competences can protect against the development of serious problematic drug use and thus must be considered in preventive efforts.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between patterns of behaviour, body composition and diet in adolescent girls. A group of 328 14 to 16-year-old girls at school in Southampton, U. K. completed a questionnaire about their behaviour and lifestyle, and had their heights, weights and skinfold thicknesses measured. Of these girls, 286 also provided dietary information. Socially independent girls were more likely to smoke, and less likely to eat breakfast and meals with family. They consumed more snacks, chocolate and soft drinks. Girls who were dissatisfied with their weight dieted and exercised, watched less television and spent less of their money on food. Dissatisfaction with weight was strongly related to body mass index. The odds of being a dieter, an indication of dissatisfaction with weight, increased with every unit increase in body mass index, so that girls with a body mass index of 24 kg/m(2)and over were 19 times more likely to diet than those with a body mass index of 19 kg/m(2)or less. Girls who were less satisfied with their weight reported lower energy intakes but ate more green vegetables and brown bread than other girls. The eating habits of the girls were therefore influenced by the extent of their social lives and by their satisfaction with their weight. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

AB BACKGROUND: Examining life expectancy and general mortality rates, the health of the population of Geneva can be described as one of the best in the world. However, in some areas Geneva fares worse than the rest of Switzerland or Europe. To re-appraise the current health priorities of the Genevan population, we analysed the relative importance of specific diseases and injuries calculating DALYs.; METHODS: We followed the procedures developed for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to ensure comparability. Some adaptations were made for mortality coding. Disability was estimated based on data for countries classified as Established Market Economies (EME) in the GBD study.; RESULTS: Non-communicable diseases accounted for 79% of the disability adjusted life years (DALY), injuries represented 12%, and communicable diseases and other disorders 9%. Ischaemic heart disease was the largest single contributor to DALY, followed by unipolar major depression. Neuropsychiatric disorders and mental health accounted for more than 23% of DALY.; CONCLUSIONS: Some of the most important problems identified-depression, osteoarthritis and alcohol abuse-would have been overlooked in an analysis based solely on mortality data. The most striking finding is the importance of mental health problems. The main limitation is the lack of morbidity data for Geneva.

AB As regulatory agencies have increased restrictions on the sale and marketing of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), they have been frustrated by the appearance of precursor molecules such as gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) that have become widely available over the Internet. These dangerous precursors are vigorously marketed to adolescents and young adults as dietary supplements that increase muscle mass and enhance sexual performance with seductive names such as Verve and Jolt, both easily recognizable teen icons. We present the case of an adolescent who ingested both of these GBL products 2 weeks apart, resulting in life-threatening respiratory depression and emergent intubation on both occasions. The GBL toxidrome, necessary acute interventions, and public health implications are reviewed. We urge all health care providers to report similar cases immediately to the FDA MedWatch system.

AB CONTEXT: Adults aged 18 to 24 years, many of whom are in college, represent the youngest legal targets for tobacco industry marketing. Cigarette smoking has been described among college students, but little is known about non-cigarette tobacco use by college students or cigar use by adults of any age.; OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of all forms of tobacco use (cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco) among US college students and to identify student- and college-level factors associated with use of each product.; DESIGN: The Harvard College Alcohol Survey, a self-administered survey conducted in 1999.; SETTING: One hundred nineteen nationally representative US 4-year colleges.; SUBJECTS: A total of 14,138 randomly selected students (60% response rate).; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report of current (in the past 30 days), past-year, and lifetime use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and all tobacco products.; RESULTS: Nearly half (45.7%) of respondents had used a tobacco product in the past year and one third (32.9%) currently used tobacco. Cigarettes accounted for most of the tobacco use (28.5% current prevalence), but cigar use was also substantial (37.1% lifetime prevalence, 23.0% past-year prevalence, and 8.5% current prevalence) and combinations of the 2 were common. Total tobacco use was higher in men than in women (37. 9% vs 29.7%; P<.001), despite nearly identical current cigarette smoking rates between the sexes (28.5% for women vs 28.4% for men), because of greater use of cigars (current prevalence, 15.7% vs 3.9%; P<.001) and smokeless tobacco (current prevalence, 8.7% vs 0.4%; P<. 001) by men. Tobacco use was significantly higher among white students (P<.001), users of other substances (alcohol and marijuana) (P<.001), and students whose priorities were social rather than educational or athletic (P<.05). Among students who had used both cigars and cigarettes, only 8.9% smoked cigars at an earlier age than they had smoked cigarettes.; CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that tobacco use is common among college students and is not limited to cigarettes. College appears to be a time when many students are trying a range of tobacco products and are in danger of developing lifelong nicotine dependence. National efforts to monitor and reduce tobacco use of all types should expand to focus on college students and other young adults. JAMA. 2000;284:699-705

AB BACKGROUND: Little is known about interpersonal and broader sociocultural factors related to protection from or use of tobacco and alcohol among immigrant adolescents. This study presents the baseline predictors of tobacco and alcohol use and susceptibility to tobacco and alcohol among Hispanic migrant adolescents.; METHODS: The sample consisted of 660 Hispanic adolescents (51% male) between the ages of 11 and 16 years enrolled in the Migrant Education Program through the County Office of Education. Slightly more than 75% of the study sample was first generation Hispanics and 79% preferred to speak Spanish. An interviewer-administered survey assessed the following information: standard demographic characteristics, modeling of cigarette smoking (including parental and peer smoking), attitudes (including self-standards and anticipated outcomes), acculturation, communication with parents, amount of social support, and satisfaction with social support.; RESULTS: Significant predictors of susceptibility to tobacco and smoking status included age, gender, attitudes toward cigarettes (e.g., anticipated outcomes, self-standards), satisfaction with social support, and parent-child communication. Factors that were also significant predictors of susceptibility to alcohol and drinking status were age, attitudes toward drinking, satisfaction with social support, and level of parent-child communication. In addition, peer and household use of alcohol predicted adolescent outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results it is suggested that tobacco and alcohol prevention efforts for first-generation Hispanic adolescents should target not only usual concerns (e.g., availability, peer pressure, modeling, expectancies), but also parent-child communication.

AB To document knowledge and attitudes regarding sexuality and sexual practices of male adolescent high school students in Lima, Peru, a self-administered, anonymous survey was completed by 991 male adolescents aged 12-19 as part of a School-Based Sex Education Intervention model. Questions concerned sociodemographic information; family characteristics; personal activities; knowledge and attitudes regarding sexuality; sexual experience; and contraceptive use. Knowledge related to sexuality was limited. Males tended to mainly discuss sexuality with their male peers (49.8%). Attitudes towards sexual activity and condom use were largely positive, although some males expressed ambivalent feelings towards the latter. Of the sample, 43% had ever had sex; age at first sexual intercourse was 13 years. While 88% of the sample would use condoms, 74% also gave reasons for not using them. Sexual activity was related to age, ever having repeated a grade, living with only one parent or in a mixed family, activities such as going to parties, use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, and viewing pornographic videos or magazines. Many male adolescents were at risk of causing an unintended pregnancy or acquiring an STD.

AB OBJECTIVES: (i) To assess the severity of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), (ii) to determine the aetiology of IDD in Gujarat, (iii) to identify the best prevalence indicator of IDD, and (iv) to compare thyroid volume (TV) results with the WHO International reference.; METHODS: Five hundred and thirty schoolchildren (6-15 years) were studied from two districts (Baroda and Dang) and data were collected on dietary habits and parameters such as height, weight, thyroid size by palpation and ultrasonography, urinary iodine (UI), and blood thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Drinking water was analyzed for iodine content and food articles for goitrogens.; RESULTS: In Gujarat children median UI (interquartile range)=56 (30-96)microg/l, mean TSH=1.71 +/- 2.10mU/l, goiter by palpatio n = 30%, and median TV = 27.8 (23-35)ml. Females had lower median UI (48 (27-82) microg/l) and higher mean TSH levels (2.0 +/- 2.5mU/l) than males. Applying the WHO ultrasonography reference to Gujarat children resulted in an enlarged TV-for-body surface area in almost 100% of subjects. Ninety-nine percent of females and 95% of males had enlarged TV-for-age. Three to eight times larger TV were seen in all subjects as compared with European children. Dang children were severely malnourished. Flavonoids like vitexin, glucosyl vitexin and apigenin were detected in pearl millet. Apigenin was never identified in pearl millet. Dang district water was lacking in iodine content.; CONCLUSIONS: IDD is a severe public health problem in Gujarat. Baroda district is a new pocket of IDD. High amounts of dietary flavonoids in Baroda and Dang districts, and lack of iodine in Dang water, account for IDD. TV measurement by ultrasound is the best prevalence indicator of IDD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare risk factors for self-harm in 2 groups: hospitalized adolescents who had attempted suicide and adolescents reporting suicide attempts in a community survey.; METHOD: All suicide attempters aged 13 to 19 years admitted to medical wards (n = 91) in a region of Norway were assessed and interviewed. Risk factors were identified by comparisons with a general population sample participating in a questionnaire study in the same community (n = 1,736). In this population sample, a separate analysis of risk factors for reporting deliberate self-harm (n = 141) was performed, applying bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models.; RESULTS: Adjusted risk factors for suicide attempts in hospitalized adolescents were depression (odds ratio [OR] = 4.7), disruptive disorders (OR = 9.4), low self-worth (OR = 1.3), infrequent support from parents (OR = 3.3) or peers (OR = 3.3), parents' excessive drinking (OR = 4.3), and low socioeconomic status (OR = 2.4). For adolescents who self-reported self-harm, depression (OR = 3.1) and loneliness (OR = 1.13) were significant adjusted risk factors (p < .001). Low self-worth, low socioeconomic status, and little support from parents or peers characterized hospitalized suicidal adolescents compared with those who were not hospitalized.; CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors were more powerful for hospitalized than for nonhospitalized adolescents. Prevention efforts should target the same factors for both groups, at a population level for nonhospitalized adolescents and at an individual level for hospitalized adolescents, with a focus on depression, low self-esteem, and family communication.

AB Healthy People 2010 objectives call for meals and snacks served in schools to contribute to overall diets that meet federal dietary guidelines. Sales in schools of foods and drinks high in calories and low in nutrients undermine this health objective, as well as participation in the more nutritious, federally sponsored, school lunch programs. Competitive foods also undermine nutrition information taught in the classroom. Lucrative contracts between school districts and soft drink companies for exclusive rights to sell one brand are the latest development in the increasing commercialization of school food. These contracts, intended to elicit brand loyalty among young children who have a lifetime of purchases ahead of them, are especially questionable because they place schools in the position of "pushing" soft drink consumption. "Pouring rights" contracts deserve attention from public health professionals concerned about the nutritional quality of children's diets.

AB BACKGROUND: An increasing number of the centrally acting muscle relaxants were withdrawn from the Norwegian market during the 1988-98 period. The only drug in this group now marketed in Norway is carisoprodol. The National Institute of Forensic Toxicology in Norway analyses all blood samples from suspected drugged drivers. In later years there has been a marked increase in the number of blood samples testing positive for carisoprodol or meprobamate (the major metabolite).; MATERIAL AND METHODS: 480 cases testing positive for central muscle relaxants in the years 1984-1998 were further studied.; RESULTS: Compared with blood samples positive primarily for benzodiazepines, there were more women in the group (39% vs. 15%), and fewer drugs and less alcohol were detected.; INTERPRETATION: The positive samples may indicate misuse or abuse due to the fact that high drug concentrations and concomitant use of benzodiazepines were frequent. This knowledge should have implications for doctors prescribing centrally acting muscle relaxants.

AB BACKGROUND: The five Nordic countries seem rather homogeneous when assessed from abroad. They do have a lot in common: similar political systems, same standard of living, and even a common language root for a large part of the population. The Nordic countries have collaborated quite closely after the Second World War in fields like the labour market, pension rights and passport control. However, the health status has varied considerably during the twentieth century, even though death rates from some of the most common diseases such as cardiovascular disease are starting to converge.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vital statistics have been compared with regard to some common diseases. The differences are described according to current knowledge on preventive programmes such as breast cancer screening and screening for cardiovascular risk. The prevalence of some lifestyle variables such as alcohol, smoking, physical activity and fat consumption are reported.; RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Lung cancer and cancer of the stomach still show substantial variation between the countries. Both discrepancies and similarities must be related to lifestyle, culture, politics and to some extent genetics. The five countries have their own viewpoints on tobacco, alcohol and nutrition policy, with the Danes the more liberal, and Swedes, Finns and Norwegians pursuing a stricter policy. These differences are to some extent reflected in the incidence of lung cancer, which are more positive in Finland, and the high death rates from liver cirrhosis in Denmark. The relatively unsatisfactory development in Denmark may be a consequence of a much longer period of structural unemployment than the other countries, as well as a more liberal attitude towards alcohol and smoking.

AB AIMS: This study seeks to estimate the extent to which a common genetic and environmental basis is shared between (i) traits delineating specific aspects of antisocial personality and alcohol misuse, and (ii) childhood family environments, traits delineating broad domains of personality pathology and alcohol misuse.; DESIGN: Postal survey data were collected from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.; SETTING: Twin pairs were recruited from Vancouver, British Columbia and London, Ontario, Canada using newspaper advertisements, media stories and twin clubs.; PARTICIPANTS: Data obtained from 324 monozygotic and 335 dizygotic twin pairs were used to estimate the extent to which traits delineating specific antisocial personality traits and alcohol misuse shared a common genetic and environmental aetiology. Data from 81 monozygotic and 74 dizygotic twin pairs were used to estimate the degree to which traits delineating personality pathology, childhood family environment and alcohol misuse shared a common aetiology.; MEASUREMENTS: Current alcohol misuse and personality pathology were measured using scales contained in the self-report Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology. Perceptions of childhood family environment were measured using the self-report Family Environment Scale.; FINDINGS: Multivariate genetic analyses showed that a subset of traits delineating components of antisocial personality (i.e. grandiosity, attention-seeking, failure to adopt social norms, interpersonal violence and juvenile antisocial behaviours) are influenced by genetic factors in common to alcohol misuse. Genetically based perceptions of childhood family environment had little relationship with alcohol misuse.; CONCLUSIONS: Heritable personality factors that influence the perception of childhood family environment play only a small role in the liability to alcohol misuse. Instead, liability to alcohol misuse is related to genetic factors common a specific subset of antisocial personality traits describing conduct problems, narcissistic and stimulus-seeking behaviour.

AB This paper illustrates the application of a Public Health Model toward understanding the nature and extent of alcohol-related problems and, in turn, provides examples of strategies targeted at reducing or preventing alcohol-related illness, injury and death in Wisconsin and Milwaukee County. More specifically, data are provided detailing the widespread use and misuse of alcohol as well as the medical, behavioral and social problems associated with its use. Alcohol use and misuse is the third leading cause of preventable death behind only tobacco use and diet/activity patterns, and therefore, warrants the implementation of prevention strategies from a public health perspective. In sum, the public health model specifies three interrelated factors--the host, the agent or vehicle, and the environment--that focus strategies to reduce and/or prevent illness, injury and death. The paper concludes with specific examples of alcohol-related public health strategies targeting the host (e.g., youth and families, minority groups), the agent/vehicle (e.g., alcohol content, labeling of containers, large containers), and the environment (e.g., motor vehicle operation BAC limits, zero tolerance laws, alcohol advertising).

AB In the period of 1990-1994 an increase of all causes mortality for 35-74 years old males was observed both in Pecs and in all Hungary. From 1994 to 1997 the mortality decreased. Similar changes, but of smaller dimension, were observed in the female population. The increasing mortality of the early 1990s is attributed primarily to the extra psycho-social stress of this period. The data of the population survey at Pecs in 1995-96 were compared to the data of earlier surveys. The mean blood total cholesterol levels and the prevalence of smoking decreased from 1990 to 1996. The prevalence of hypertension and male obesity increased. Physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and lack of improvement of diet still represent significant health problems. High prevalence of increased gamma-glutamyl transferase indicate high prevalence of excess alcohol consumption. The risk factor profile of 18-25 year old males is very unfavourable. Smoking prevalence in females aged 26-35 years exceeds that of males of the same age group. Preventive efforts should be focused to young males and females.

AB CONTEXT: Adolescent sexual behavior is typically studied as a dichotomy: Adolescents have had sex or they have not. Broadening this view would lead to a greater understanding of teenagers' sexual behavior.; METHODS: Interview data from 907 high school students in Alabama, New York and Puerto Rico were used to examine the relationships between sexual experience and a variety of social, psychological and behavioral variables. Four groups of teenagers are compared: those who did not anticipate initiating sex in the next year (delayers), those who anticipated initiating sex in the next year (anticipators), those who had had one sexual partner (singles) and those who had had two or more partners (multiples).; RESULTS: Compared with delayers, anticipators reported more alcohol use and marijuana use; poorer psychological health; riskier peer behaviors; and looser ties to family school and church. Similarly, multiples reported more alcohol and marijuana use, riskier peer behaviors and looser ties to family and school than singles. Risk behaviors, peer behaviors, family variables, and school and church involvement showed a linear trend across the four categories of sexual behavior.; CONCLUSIONS: The traditional sex-no sex dichotomy obscures differences among sexually inexperienced teenagers and among adolescents who have had sex. Prevention efforts must be tailored to the specific needs of teenagers with differing sexual experiences and expectations, and must address the social and psychological context in which sexual experiences occur.

AB The number of US children who are overweight has more than doubled over the last decade. This change has broadened the focus of dietary guidance for children to address nutrient overconsumption and physical activity patterns. Total fat consumption expressed as a percentage of energy intake has decreased among US children. However, this decrease is largely the result of increased total energy intake in the form of carbohydrates and not necessarily due to decreased fat consumption. The majority of children aged 5-17 years are not meeting recommendations for Ca intakes. Much of this deficit is attributed to changing beverage consumption patterns, characterized by declining milk intakes and substantial increases in soft-drink consumption. On average, US children are not eating the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables. US adolescents become less active as they get older, and one-quarter of all US children watch > or = 4 h television each day, which is positively associated with increased BMI and skinfold thickness. There is an urgent need in the USA for effective prevention strategies aimed at helping children grow up with healthful eating and physical activity habits to achieve optimal health.

AB Research designs to study alcohol use and abuse have included twin, adoption and family history/high risk studies. Results have consistently implied a genetic factor in the aetiology of alcohol abuse. However, less research has been conducted in search of environmental factors. This study uses kinship structure in a large national dataset (the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) to estimate (using DeFries-Fulker analysis) the extent of the shared genetic, non-shared genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental influences on alcohol use. The NLSY kinship sample contained 3890 pairs of cousins, half-siblings, full-siblings and twins between the ages of 14 and 21 in the initial year of the survey (1979). Estimates of heritability (h2) and shared environment (c2) were small to moderate for the entire dataset for both light drinking and heavy drinking behaviour, with h2 estimates slightly higher in each case. Non-shared genetic measures of self-esteem and locus of control accounted for a significant portion of the remaining variance in heavy drinking behaviour. Race and gender patterns showed c2 and h2 estimates that were also small to moderate for both light and heavy drinking behaviour. Significant non-shared effects were found for the White group for heavy drinking behaviour, and for male pairs for both heavy and light drinking behaviour. Additionally, implications and future directions are discussed.

AB STUDY DESIGN: The Mississippi spinal cord injury surveillance system is both active and passive, designed to capture all cases of spinal cord injury through mandated reporting by multiple sources. Each case is confirmed by medical record review.; OBJECTIVES: To describe the development of a state-wide spinal cord injury surveillance system, discuss findings from the system, and evaluate sensitivity.; SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the United States, the annual incidence rate of spinal cord injury requiring hospital admission has been estimated at 32-50 per million. With prehospital fatalities included, the estimated incidence rate ranges from 43 to 55 per million population annually.; METHODS: In the current study all cases identified during the first 2 years of operation of the spinal cord injury (SCI) system were included. To evaluate the sensitivity of the system, International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes from each hospital's discharge database were used.; RESULTS: The incidence rate among patients in hospitals and prehospital fatal cases was 77 per million. The rate for patients in hospitals was 59 per million. The incidence rate of spinal cord injury among males was 4.4 times higher than among females. Rates of spinal cord injury were highest among persons 20-24 years of age. Rates were similar for whites and blacks. The most frequent causes of spinal cord injury were motor vehicle collisions, violence, and falls. Additional cases were identified during the evaluation, resulting in a 94% sensitivity.; CONCLUSIONS: Mississippi's spinal cord injury incidence rates are substantially higher than rates reported for other states except Alaska. The surveillance system was found to be very complete. Prevention efforts should focus on increasing safety belt usage, increasing alcohol awareness, and reducing violence.

AB Adolescent patients need knowledge and motivation to practice a healthy lifestyle. The provider of adolescent health care is uniquely qualified to provide factual health information and practical advice. Enlisting parental support for confidential adolescent health services usually is not problematic when parents and health care providers share common goals and responsibility. The health care provider must develop rapport to foster high-risk health behavior disclosure and must promote health messages that are stronger than those received from peers, television, movies, and magazines. Adolescents who elect to abstain from sexual activity need as much support as sexually active patients. Depression, substance abuse, and eating disorders must be recognized and treated. Preventative health care services for adolescents can be optimized when office staff understand the special needs of these young women. The physician's concerns regarding the health of adolescent patients will be welcomed by patients, their parents, and the community.

AB Anabolic steroids have become increasingly popular among athletes even at subcompetitive or recreational level instead of extensive doping tests, educational campaigns and lethal incidents. Nowadays, the fitness boom has also produced a population of steroid users at high school level and also under non-sports practicing children. After opening the borders to East Europe an explosion of the black-market for anabolic steroids occurred. Beside the well-known side effects of anabolic steroids new problems and risks occurred due to fake drugs from the black market. This review ist subdivided into two parts: We provide a detailed review of the literature an anabolic steroids to the reader the information needed to make an informed decision an the relative risks and benefits of anabolic steroids. Secondly, we evaluated 40 "anabolic steroids" obtained from the black market using mass spectrometry or gas chromatography analysis to evaluate the real pharmacological compounds. As the results of this analysis, we found that 15 (37.5%) these drugs contained different or any pharmacological compounds as labeled. From the external packing, a differentiation between original and the fake drugs was impossible. Therefore, a large information and credibility gap concerning anabolic steroids particular those from the black market exists between the athletes and the medical and scientific communities. We believe that this gap can only be closed if both groups are be better informed about anabolic steroids.

AB This study assessed the risk factors for Giardia intestinalis infection in an agricultural population in Mexico. Exposure groups included 2,257 individuals from households exposed to untreated wastewater, 2,147 from a group using the effluent from a series of reservoirs, and 2,344 from rain-fed agricultural villages. Stool samples were collected from 6,748 individuals. Wastewater samples were tested for fecal coliforms/100 ml and Giardia sp. cysts/L. Untreated wastewater samples contained 10(8) fecal coliforms/100 ml and up to 300 Giardia sp. cysts/L. Hydraulic retention (3-7 months) in the reservoirs, however, provided an improved effluent quality (10(1)-10(4) fecal coloforms/100 ml and < or = 5 Giardia sp. cysts/L). Children 1-14 years of age had the highest prevalence of infection (20%). Data showed marginal associations between storing drinking water in unprotected containers and lack of facilities for feces disposal and the risk of infection (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.76 and 1.19, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 0.95-3.23, and 0.97-1.45, respectively). Individuals purchasing vegetables at the city market had higher rates of infection than those buying at the village shop (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.00-6.17). No excess risk was found in individuals exposed to untreated wastewater compared with controls (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.84-1.36); the group using reservoir water was not different from the controls (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.94-1.58). No risk from agricultural activities was detected (OR = 0.83). This pattern of infection may be addressed by primary health care and wastewater treatment.

AB Community-based interventions offer a promising solution for reducing child and adolescent unintentional injuries. By focusing on altering behavior, promoting environmental change within the community, or passing and enforcing legislation, these interventions seek to change social norms about acceptable safety behaviors. This article systematically reviews 32 studies that evaluated the impact of community-based injury prevention efforts on childhood injuries, safety behaviors, and the adoption of safety devices. Interventions targeted schools, municipalities, and cities. Most relied on an educational approach, sometimes in combination with legislation or subsidies, to reduce the cost of safety devices such as bicycle helmets. Results indicate that community-based approaches are effective at increasing some safety practices, such as bicycle helmet use and car seat use among children. The evidence is less compelling that such interventions increase child pedestrian safety, increase adolescent vehicle safety by reducing drinking and driving behaviors, or reduce rates of several categories of childhood injuries. Strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of community-based interventions is lacking, in part because few studies used randomized controlled designs or examined injury rates among children and youths as outcome measures. Nonetheless, this review identifies common elements of successful community-based approaches that should be replicated in future studies. First, the use of multiple strategies grounded in a theory of behavior change is critical. Second, to maximize success, interventions should be integrated into the community and approaches should be tailored to meet unique community needs. Third, community stakeholders should be included in the development of community-based strategies. This community involvement and ownership of the intervention increases the likelihood of modeling and peer pressure, leading to widespread adoption of a safety behavior. Finally, when possible, a randomized controlled design should be used to maximize the trustworthiness of reported findings and aid decisions about where to invest resources in community-based approaches to injury prevention.

AB PURPOSE: To replicate earlier research findings on risk factors for youth violence and to explore the effects on violent behavior of constructs shown to increase risk for other problem behaviors, within a developmental frame.; METHODS: Data were from the Seattle Social Development Project (SSDP), a prospective study involving a panel of youths followed since 1985. Potential risk factors for violence at age 18 years were measured at ages 10, 14, and 16 years. Bivariate relationships involving risk factor constructs in the individual, family, school, peer and community domains and violence were examined at each age to assess changes in their strength of prediction over time. Attention was also given to the additive strength of increasing numbers of risk factors in the prediction of violence at age 18 years. A final set of analyses explored the extent to which youths were correctly classified as having committed a violent act (or not) at age 18 years on the basis of their overall level of risk at ages 10, 14, and 16 years.; RESULTS: At each age, risk factors strongly related to later violence were distributed among the five domains. Ten of 15 risk factors constructs measured at age 10 years were significantly predictive of violence at age 18 years. Twenty of 25 constructs measured at age 14 years and 19 of 21 constructs measured at age 16 years were significantly predictive of later violence. Many constructs predicted violence from more than one developmental point. Hyperactivity (parent rating), low academic performance, peer delinquency, and availability of drugs in the neighborhood predicted violence from ages 10, 14, and 16 years. Analyses of the additive effects of risk factors revealed that youths exposed to multiple risks were notably more likely than others to engage in later violence. The odds for violence of youths exposed to more than five risk factors compared to the odds for violence of youths exposed to fewer than two risk factors at each age were seven times greater at age 10 years, 10 times greater at age 14 years, and nearly 11 times greater at age 16 years. However, despite information gained from all significant risk factors, the overall accuracy in predicting youths who would go on to commit violent acts was limited.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the study have important implications for preventive intervention programs. Prevention efforts must be comprehensive and developmentally sensitive, responding to large groups or populations exposed to multiple risks.

AB As AIDS cases among US women continue to increase, a better understanding of women's behavioural risk patterns is needed to inform intervention efforts. Data were from 2,945 women drug injectors and crack users. Statistical analyses compared sociodemographic variables, lifetime behavioural risk patterns, HIV sero-prevalence and history of sexually transmitted diseases, and determined predictors of HIV infection separately in 16 low and four high sero-prevalence sites. Based on risk patterns, four behaviourally-defined sub-groups were constructed, and rates of HIV sero-prevalence were compared. In comparisons between low and high sero-prevalence sites, there were significant differences on most variables examined, and in the relative importance of the sociodemographic characteristics and risk patterns predicting HIV. Drug injection and sex exchange were each independent, significant, behavioural predictors of infection, with no significant difference between the odds ratios attributed to each predictor. HIV sero-prevalence was significantly different among four sub-groups. Interventions must be tailored to address observed differences among women in low and high sero-prevalence sites. Injection drug use and exchanging sex each play a major role in the transmission of HIV infection to US women. Prevention efforts targeted at women should address differences in behavioural risk patterns. Aggressive and innovative interventions are needed for women who exchange sex. AIDS research must investigate how socioeconomic factors impact women's risk for HIV infection.

AB Eastern Europe is experiencing increased rates of HIV/AIDS, and the Russian Federation is among the countries with the most alarming case rate increases. Behavioural and biological studies demonstrate that the transmission of HIV in Russia is occurring as a result of injection drug use, homosexual, and heterosexual risk behaviours. Factors that promote risk and therefore enable HIV transmission in Russia parallel those found in other countries, including epidemics of other sexually transmitted infections, economic instability, poverty, and social factors such as gender roles. Research is urgently needed to better understand and forecast the HIV epidemic in Russia, as well as to develop effective interventions to prevent a Russian AIDS crisis. 
A2 This article reviews the evidence of an emerging AIDS crisis in Russia
   and highlights the urgent need for comprehensive HIV prevention efforts
   in Eastern Europe.  It is apparent that there are several HIV epidemics
   in Russia.  Epidemiological data can attest to the multiple modes of HIV
   transmission in the country, and particularly among young people
   engaging in heterogeneous patterns of risk behaviors.  In addition, HIV
   genotype research confirms that multiple HIV epidemics are
   simultaneously emerging in the country.  Such research also shows that
   complicated social forces are advancing HIV sub-epidemics.  Enabling
   factors propagating HIV epidemics include biological and social
   co-factors, particularly drug use, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual
   mixing patterns, economic instability, gender roles, and poverty.  Wide
   scale public health education and AIDS awareness campaigns, specialized
   prevention outreach, social marketing, risk reduction counseling, and
   prevention policy initiatives directed toward communities and population
   segments at highest risk for infection are recommended to help curb the
   HIV epidemic.

AB OBJECTIVE: The process that connects media use with alcohol-related beliefs and behaviors has not been well documented. To address this issue, we examined adolescents' viewing patterns, beliefs about alcohol and media messages, and parental discussion of media messages in the context of a theoretical model of message interpretation processes. Measures included the degree to which adolescents found portrayals desirable, realistic, and similar to their own lives; the degree to which they wanted to be like (identify with) the portrayals; and the degree to which they associated positive outcomes with drinking alcohol (expectancies).; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.; SETTING: Two public high schools in the California central coastal area that include a diverse population in terms of ethnic origin, income level, and education level.; PARTICIPANTS: Ninth-grade students (n = 252) and 12th-grade students (n = 326).; OUTCOME MEASURES: Students reported the number of days within the past week watching various genres of television content, along with perceptions of realism of content, desirability of portrayals, identification with portrayals, expectancies toward alcohol use, personal norms for alcohol use, desire for products with alcohol logos, current alcohol use, frequency of parental reinforcement, and counter-reinforcement of television messages. Associations were examined via hierarchical multiple regression analysis.; RESULTS: Effects of media exposure on drinking behavior, controlling for grade level, ethnicity, gender, household income, and education levels were primarily positive and indirect, operating through a number of intervening beliefs, especially expectancies (beta =.59; r(2) =.33). Direct associations, primarily with exposure to late-night talk shows (beta =.12; r(2) =.01), were small. Parental discussion also affected behavior indirectly, operating through expectancies, identification, and perceived realism. The appeal of products with alcohol logos, which was higher among the younger students (t = 3.44) and predicted by expectancies (beta =. 37; r(2) =.13), sports viewing (beta =.17; r(2) =.03) and late-night talk shows (beta =.10; r(2) =.01), predicted actual drinking behavior (beta =.22; r(2) =.04). Drinking behavior was higher among the older students (t = -2.515).; CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents make drinking decisions using a progressive, logical decision-making process that can be overwhelmed by wishful thinking. The potential risk of frequent exposure to persuasive alcohol portrayals via late-night talk shows, sports, music videos, and prime-time television for underage drinking is moderated by parental reinforcement and counter-reinforcement of messages. Interventions need to acknowledge and counter the appeal of desirable and seemingly realistic alcohol portrayals in the media and alert parents to their potential for unintended adverse effects.

AB The prevalence and costs of alcohol and drug disorders pose a serious social concern for policymakers. In this paper, we use data from the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) to estimate simple descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models of the relationship between symptoms of dependence and labor market outcomes for alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and other illicit drugs. For men, we find that substance use with symptoms of dependence is associated with both lower employment rates and fewer hours of work. For women, we find that substance use with symptoms of dependence is associated with lower employment rates, but we find no consistent evidence of a relationship between symptoms of dependence and the number of hours worked. Finally, all of our point estimates are smaller in magnitude when we control for multiple substance use, suggesting that comorbidities play a critical role in the relationship between substance use and labor market outcomes. Our results suggest that policymakers and researchers should consider the full spectrum of substance use and dependence rather than focusing on the simple use of a single substance.

AB This study investigated psychosocial risk factors in adolescents and assessed gender differences in the frequency of their occurrence. A specially designed questionnaire, which included validated scales for the evaluation of depression (Zung Self-rating Depression Scale) and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), was administered to a representative sample of Slovenian adolescents. The final sample consisted of 4,590 high school students of both sexes, aged 14 to 19 years. Data analysis revealed several significant gender differences. Girls more often than boys reported family conflict, personal problems, physical inactivity, attempts to control body weight, use of psychoactive drugs, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Their level of depression was higher and self-esteem lower when compared with their male counterparts. Boys more often than girls indicated that they watched a great deal of television, were the victims of peer violence, and drank alcohol.

AB Historically, interventions to prevent STD/HIV transmission have been categorized by program methodology rather than defining the content and nature of the intervention. A new taxonomy is needed to help expand the scope of interventions that can be used to prevent STD and HIV transmission. The taxonomy defines two major types of interventions, individual-level and structural level. The former targets risk factors attributable to individuals. Structural interventions target conditions outside the control of the individual. Individual-level interventions focus on counseling, screening, and treatment. They include psychological and biological interventions. Structural-level interventions address accessibility of relevant consumer products (condoms, needles), physical structures (e.g. blighted and abandoned housing, lighting, design of social facilities), social structures (policies that facilitate or constrain behaviors such as supervision of youth, and enforcement of alcohol beverage laws); and media messages (messages and images in the broadcast and print media that portray high-risk behaviors as positive and without serious consequences). A new taxonomy not only clarifies the content of preventive interventions but highlights neglected strategies involving individual biological interventions and structural interventions to prevent STD/HIV transmission.

AB Quantitative alcohol interviews conducted as part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Native American Supplement revealed very high rates of alcohol use among American Indian and Alaska Native active crack and injection drug users (IDUs). Of 147 respondents who completed the alcohol questionnaire, 100& percent had drunk alcohol within the past month, almost 42& percent reported that they drank every day, and 50& percent drank until they were drunk one-half of the time or more. Injection drug users (IDUs) demonstrated the highest frequency and quantity of alcohol use in the past 30 days. A significant positive association was also found between crack and alcohol use in the past 48 hours (c(2)=5.30, p<.05). Finally, those claiming more episodes of using alcohol before or during sex, reported significantly more events of unprotected sexual intercourse. Qualitative data from all four sites corroborated these quantitative findings. Many individuals also reported episodes of blacking out while drinking, and learned later that they had had unprotected sex with complete strangers or individuals they would not otherwise accept as partners. Implications of these findings for HIV/AIDS prevention efforts are addressed.

AB Substance abuse often begins in adolescence and is a major factor determining health outcomes for adolescents and adults; thus, it is an important focus for prevention strategies. The use of drugs, especially alcohol, can lead to chronic addiction to substances as well as contribute to a number of common chronic conditions. These conditions include cancer, cardiovascular disease, disability from accidents or violence, and unplanned pregnancy and are major causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescents and adults. As the major social unit responsible for socialization of children and stabilization of adult personalities, the family has been the target of prevention efforts. In this chapter the empirical literature on family interventions to prevent substance use in adolescents is critically reviewed, generalizations and implications for practice identified, and directions for future research projected.

AB A survey of 273 children in Washington state used a predrinking behavior index as a behavioral outcome to assess media effects on precursors to drinking among children for whom alcohol consumption is not yet occurring. It also examined age trends in relevant beliefs and behaviors. Perceptions of advertising desirability, the extent to which it seemed appealing, increased steadily from third to ninth grade, whereas identification with portrayals, the degree to which individuals wanted to emulate portrayals, leveled off after sixth grade. Expectancies, positive social benefits perceived to be associated with drinking alcohol, also increased with age, particularly between sixth and ninth grade. When demographics and grade level were controlled, desirability predicted identification, and both predicted expectancies, which is consistent with media decision-making theory. Expectancies correlated with alcohol predrinking behavior, and expectancies predicted risky behavior, with demographics and grade level controlled. Predrinking behavior and reported risky behavior were correlated. The results provide cross-sectional support for the view that beliefs and desires developing by third grade prime children for future decisions regarding substance use.

AB The purpose of this study was to further investigate a post-hoc finding on racial differences in children's alcohol expectancies. This was a secondary analysis of data originally collected for an evaluation study of longitudinal effects of a pre-school substance abuse prevention program in Cleveland. OH. Ss were second and third grade students who had received intervention services 3 years earlier and a matched comparison group who had not. The samples were combined for a total N = 69. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess differences in alcohol expectancy scores (on the Children's Alcohol-Related Expectancies (CARE) questionnaire). Data analysis revealed significantly higher CARE scores for black children than for whites. Most of the variance was in a sub-scale, which measures beliefs on how alcohol effects arousal and aggression. The finding that black children more often reported beliefs that alcohol intensifies feelings and makes fighting easier may suggest differential exposure to models of behavior. Alternatively, the finding may reflect aspects of alcohol marketing in African American communities.

Six setting characteristics are considered of primary importance in health-care facilities: comforts and conveniences, safety, attractiveness, size, privacy, and arrangement/location. This study presents the perceptions regarding these and other setting features held by female clients and staff from a substance abuse treatment facility. Results support the importance of these six setting characteristics in influencing clients' treatment goals. Four other setting variables emerged as important to women's recovery: participation in a residential, drug-free, gender-specific program that provides on-site child care. Attention to these variables may provide facilities with an advantage in today's competitive market for clients.

Projects reflected both action and evaluation research traditions and focused on a variety of issues from moderation of drinking to alcohol-related violence, and on range of target populations from youth to specific ethnic groups. The interventions described ranged from policy-based prevention to education and training and to secondary prevention and treatment. Lessons identified in the papers are discussed within three broad areas: the community targeted for change; the implementation of community projects; and community action research projects generally. The common lessons emerging from these diverse projects provide useful lessons on which to base future progress in community action research.

AB Within a community action research program, messages for the community population can be conveyed through already existing channels (newspapers, magazines, TV, radio) or special tools can be created. As part of the Rifredi Health District (16,900 inhabitants), Florence, Italy, Community Alcohol Action Research Project, 5,500 alcohol carousels (translated and adapted from the Stockholm carousel) were distributed during 1996 in the project's area where they were freely available. Two samples, one of a consumers' association (response rate 26%) and the other of school parents, employed a questionnaire. A few local key people underwent a qualitative interview. In all circumstances the carousel proved to be understandable, useful, and able to elicit discussions about alcohol issues. In 1996-97, after a 2-year training program in communication skills and alcohol prevention, 13 teachers in local preschools, elementary schools, and middle schools planned and implemented a health education program on the issues of alcohol and food. One outcome was nine drawings produced by the school children. The drawings were exhibited in some schools and supermarkets, and were hung in city buses.

Fatality reports for all fire-related deaths in the state of Alabama from 1992 to 1997 were obtained from the State Fire Marshall's Office. Fatality rates were calculated and compared according to age, sex, and race. Descriptive statistics were generated for population and fire characteristics. Fatality rates were higher among black people, men, children, and older people. Approximately half (48.8%) of the deaths occurred between the months of November and March; July had the lowest proportion of deaths (5.0%). Residential fires accounted for the largest proportion of deaths. Fatality rates were higher for mobile home residents. Overall, smoke detectors were present in only 32.5% of the residential fires. The presence of smoke detectors was more common with deaths in urban locations (41.8%) than with deaths in rural locations (20.8%). The most frequently reported cause of fatal fires was misuse of cigarettes. More than half of the victims aged 18 years and older tested positive for alcohol. Fire prevention efforts should focus on smoke detectors, fire-safe cigarettes, and alcohol. Mobile home residents should also be targeted for fire prevention initiatives.

Being attracted to members of the same-sex was associated with more frequent binge drinking among boys and girls, and a three- to four-fold increase in the likelihood of reporting injecting drug use both over the lifetime and within the previous 12 months.; CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents attracted to members of the same-sex report engaging in elevated levels of health-limiting behaviours. There is an urgent need for further research to document the reasons for this. It is recommended that health promotion activities directed at moderating young people's drug and alcohol practices explicitly acknowledge the over-representation of same-sex attracted young people in their target audience.

AB Since the 1980s hepatitis B and C have spread greatly among intravenous drug consumers. This shows up today in a high prevalence for both pathogens. It is striking that many patients who have only consumed drugs intravenously for a few years have already been infected with hepatitis B or C. The clear reduction in the spread of HIV within the drug-using community achieved by targeted measures during recent years has not had a similar impact on hepatitis B and C. Given this background, optimising preventive efforts among intravenous drug users is of great importance. Structural steps for therapy and damage-reduction should be optimised even more. Moreover, individual protective behaviour among patients should be improved. Medical advice and care is of great importance in this case. New studies show that many intravenous drug consumers are insufficiently informed on the risks of infection from shared use of injection utensils (spoons, filters, etc.) or drug sharing with used needles. Moreover, many drug consumers are not vaccinated against hepatitis B. Medical advice on protective behaviour should address these problems more directly. In the future, other sustainable intervention programmes based on this approach will need to be developed.

AB The early onset of alcohol and tobacco use has been associated with increased risk for later substance abuse and dependence problems. This study investigated genetic and environmental influences on age at onset of alcohol and tobacco use by examining twin resemblance for several retrospectively reported onset milestones including age at first use, age at first alcohol intoxication experience, and age at regular use. In addition, we also examined the latency between age at first use and age at regular use of tobacco and alcohol. The subjects were a volunteer sample of older adult twins 50 to 96 years of age. MZ twin correlations for age at first alcohol use and age at first tobacco use were .57 and .44, respectively, compared to .45 and .37 for DZ same-sex twins. MZ twins correlated .30 and .26 for the latencies between first use and regular use of alcohol and of tobacco, while DZ correlations were -.01 and .05, respectively. Biometrical model-fitting results confirmed that familial resemblance for age at first use for both alcohol and tobacco was largely the result of shared environmental factors, while the latencies between first use and regular patterns of use were more genetically influenced. These findings add to a growing body of literature suggesting that initiation of substance use is influenced primarily by environmental rather than genetic factors.

AB We examined the possible role of religious upbringing as a mediator of the shared environmental influences and as a moderator of the genetic influences on the risk of alcohol use initiation in a large population-based sample of Dutch adolescent and young adult twins (1967 twin pairs). There was not a significant association between religious participation and alcohol use initiation among Dutch adolescents and young adults. We also hypothesized that the relative magnitude of the genetic influences on the risk of alcohol use initiation would be greater for those adolescents and young adults who were raised in a less religious environment compared to those adolescents and young adults who were raised in a more religious environment. We indeed found higher heritabilities for females without a religious upbringing compared to females with a religious upbringing. Genetic influences accounted for 40% of the variance in alcohol use initiation in nonreligious females, compared to 0% in religiously raised females. Shared environmental influences accounted for 54% of the variance for nonreligious females and 88% of the variance in religious females. For males, the genetic variance was also higher in the nonreligious group compared to the religious group, but this difference was not statistically significant. Whether or not they were raised religiously, the liability to alcohol use initiation in males was moderately influenced by genetic factors (30%) and substantially influenced by shared environmental factors (60%).

We have completed such a study, which we compare to a similar study independently conducted in 1998. In both studies, both the parent and offspring were assessed blindly and independently by direct diagnostic interviews, and parental assessment of offspring was also obtained. The similarity in design and methods between studies provided an opportunity for replication by reanalysis of data. The major findings are a replication in two independently conducted studies of school-aged offspring of opiate- and/or cocaine-addicted mothers of the high rates of any psychiatric disorder (60% in both studies), major depression (20%, 26%), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (18%, 23%), conduct disorder (17%, 9%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (13%, 8%), and substance abuse (5%, 10%) among offspring. Both studies also found high rates of comorbid alcohol abuse, depression, and multiple drugs of abuse in the mothers. We conclude that efforts to replicate findings by analyses of independently conducted studies are an inexpensive way to test the sturdiness of findings that can provide the empirical basis for preventive efforts. Clinically, the data in both studies suggest that both drug dependence and associated psychopathology should be assessed and treated in opiate addicts with young offspring, and the offspring should be monitored for the development of conduct and mood disorders and substance use.

AB PURPOSE: To examine characteristics of youth homelessness associated with engaging in risk behaviors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).; METHODS: The sample included 288 currently homeless or runaway Washington, DC youth aged 14-21 years. Measures were self-reported homelessness characteristics, unsafe sexual behavior, injection drug use, and background characteristics. Bivariate and multivariable analyses of the relationships between homelessness characteristics and HIV risk behaviors were conducted.; RESULTS: Both male (n = 140) and female (n = 148) participants reported high rates of unsafe sexual behaviors, but low rates of injection drug use. HIV risk was significantly associated in bivariate analyses with severity of homelessness circumstances (i.e., spending the night in public place or with strangers, going hungry, and participating in the street economy), the duration of homelessness (i.e., greater number of episodes of homelessness, longer time length of current episode), and specific reasons for being homeless (i.e., thrown out). In addition, sexual victimization and older age were associated with increased HIV risk. In multivariable models, a smaller set of these homelessness characteristics remained significant independent correlates and explained a substantial amount of the variation in the HIV risk indices for both males and females.; CONCLUSIONS: The results contribute to greater theoretical understanding of the characteristics of homelessness associated with increased risk of HIV infection within this vulnerable population of youth. The associations between homelessness characteristics and HIV risk suggest the need for HIV prevention efforts to focus directly on ameliorating the homelessness circumstances of youth.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the attitudes of injecting drug users (IDUs) towards the establishment of safe injecting rooms (SIRs) in Melbourne, Australia.; METHODS: Multi-site convenience sampling at Needle and Syringe Exchange Programs (NSEPs) within six Melbourne suburbs. Four hundred current IDUs were recruited directly through NSEP and participant snowballing. Respondents completed either a semi-structured interview, anonymous self-report questionnaire, face-to-face interview or participated in a focus group. Participants were asked to report on their knowledge and attitudes about SIR, their experiences and concerns as participants of street-based illicit drug markets, and their willingness to use SIRs if established.; RESULTS: Participants (91%) were knowledgeable about the SIR issue and thought such a strategy had potential to address both personal and wider community harms associated with public injecting. Most (77%) indicated they would be willing to use a SIR if established in Melbourne. Gender, lifetime non-fatal overdose episodes and frequency of heroin use were all significantly related to a person's willingness to use SIRs. A significant number also reported a preference for injecting at their own place of residence due to concerns regarding privacy, safety and police presence within street-based market places.; CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of important issues relating to the likely demand and uptake of SIRs that should be addressed when considering the feasibility of establishing SIRs within Australia.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use among Australian secondary school students.; METHOD: Data was collected as part of the Australian School Student's Alcohol and Drugs Survey, a national survey of 29,447 secondary school students.; RESULTS: Of all students aged 12-17 years, 39.9% (44.1% of males and 35.9% of females) reported having used at least one illicit drug in their lifetime. Cannabis was the most widely used illicit drug with 36.4% of all students reporting having used cannabis. Substantially fewer students reported using other drugs: hallucinogens (8.6%), amphetamines (6.1%), cocaine (3.6%), ecstasy (3.6%), opiates (3.7%) and steroids (1.8%). There were clear gender and age differences in the prevalence of illicit drug use: more males than females reported illicit drug use and the lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use increased with age. Most of those who reported illicit drug use had used drugs on relatively few occasions although there was a small minority of the sample who reported more frequent use. Finally, there were strong association between regular cannabis use and the use of other illicit drugs in the past year, and moderate associations between illicit drug use and the extent of both tobacco and alcohol use.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this, the first national survey of illicit drug use among Australian school students, indicate a high prevalence of illicit drug use. Comparisons with previous regionally based surveys suggest there may have been a recent increase in the prevalence of cannabis use and highlight the need for further monitoring of and prevention efforts aimed at reducing illicit drug use among students.

AB This research examined the responses of 73 Mexican American and Anglo young adults to four televised drinking-and-driving warnings. Warnings were manipulated into collectivist (emphasizing risks to family and friends) and individualist (emphasizing risks to self) appeals, and into high and low power distance appeals by attributing or not attributing warnings to the Surgeon General. Females rated the collectivist warnings, and males the individualist warnings, more believable. Respondents on average responded to the collectivist warnings most positively, regardless of gender or ethnicity. Anglos rated warnings without the Surgeon General as the source more believable than warnings with the Surgeon General as the source; the opposite was true for Latinos. Other interactions were also found.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine public awareness and knowledge of oral cancer in Great Britain.; DESIGN: The respondents were selected according to a systematic probability sample designed to be representative of all adults in Great Britain (GB). The overall design was similar to previous omnibus surveys carried out by National Opinion Poll (NOP). The survey was carried out in ten regions of GB in September 1995 and was commissioned by the Health Education Authority (HEA).; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A random sample of 1,894 members of the public over the age of 16 years were asked in face-to-face interviews their knowledge relating to cancer, with particular reference to oral cancer, its causes and those at high risk and general attitudes to cancer.; RESULTS: Oral cancer was one of the least heard of cancers by the public with only 56% of the participants being aware, whereas 96% had heard of skin cancer, 97% lung cancer and 86% cervical cancer. There was a 76% awareness of the link between smoking and oral cancer but only 19% were aware of its association with alcohol misuse. Whereas 94% agreed that early detection can improve the treatment outcome, a disheartening 43% believed that whether a person developed a cancer or not was a matter of chance and therefore was unavoidable.; CONCLUSIONS: This survey highlights a general lack of awareness among the public about mouth cancer and a lack of knowledge about its causation especially the excess risk associated with alcohol.; RECOMMENDATIONS: There is a clear need to inform and educate the public in matters relating to the known risk factors associated with oral cancer. A media campaign informing the public about oral cancer is clearly required. The need for the reduction in the incidence of oral cancer should be included in 'Our healthier nation' targets. An overall health promotion strategy to reduce cancers should include oral cancer as a priority. In addition the European Code against Cancer which aims to improve prevention, the early detection of oral cancer and the necessity for fast track referral should be made more widely known. Recognition of oral cancer in local strategies for oral health should be encouraged.

AB Three children, two girls aged 9 and 13 years and a boy aged 9 years, and a man aged 22, presented with headache of migrainoid character. The complaints resolved after attention had been given to sleeping habits, notably problems with falling asleep. The literature on the relationship between lack of sleep and headache is scarce. In history-taking doctors often neglect sleeping customs. Yet awareness of this connection can provide the clue to a successful treatment of headache. In more than half the children with headache who are referred to the outpatient clinic of Neurology, a serious lack of sleep is a major contributing factor to the problems. One should strongly advise against use of coffee and Cola drinks at all times and of tea in the evening. Patients are urged to create a restful atmosphere about bedtime: taking a walk or a hot shower, being told a story and so on. They should not read in bed, watch TV or play computer games in the bedroom. Prescription of clonidine 0.025-0.075 mg in children before bedtime may be useful.

AB Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, a cyanobacterium that is marketed as a health food supplement, is harvested from natural blooms in Klamath Lake (Oregon) that are occasionally contaminated by Microcystis spp. Regulatory agencies in several countries are developing regulations to control the amount of microcystin in drinking water and other products, including products produced from A. flos-aquae. Regulation of microcystin (MC), a toxin produced by Microcystis spp. that is potentially present in natural culture of A. flos-aquae, should be based on studies in which a test species is exposed to the natural mixture of these cyanobacteria. A 1984 feeding trial to determine the effects of high dietary levels of A. flos-aquae on reproduction and development of mice is reanalyzed in light of recent analyses for microcystin-LR (MCLR) in the diets of those mice. Young adult mice consuming up to 333 microg MCLR/kg body weight (bw)/day exhibited no adverse effects on growth and reproduction, fetal development, and survival and organ weights of neonates. Based on a NOAEL of 333 microg MCLR/kg bw/day, a safety factor of 1000, consumption of 2 g/day of A. flos-aquae by a 60-kg adult, the safe level of MCLR as a contaminant of A. flos-aquae products is calculated to be 10.0 microg MCLR/g.

AB INTRODUCTION: This study estimated the 1995 state-level prevalence of occupant restraint use for children and adults, child bicycle helmet use, not drinking and driving, and installation and regular checking of smoke detectors.; METHODS: Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were weighted to reflect the age, sex, and racial distribution of each state. State prevalence estimates were ranked by quartile.; RESULTS: Prevalence estimates for five of the six behaviors varied widely across states. Use of safety belts among adults ranged from 41.5 to 87.3% (median 66.7%); use of child occupant restraints, 62.3 to 95.7% (80.8%); not drinking and driving within the past 30 days, 94.7- 99.4% (97.8%); smoke detector installation, 78.9 to 98.7% (94.1%); monthly checking of smoke detectors, 31.3- 51.2% (40.4%); and child use of bicycle helmets, 9. 3 to 62.8% (23.1%). Certain states had consistently poor quartile rankings. States with behavior-relevant laws appeared to have the highest level of associated safety practices for impaired driving, adult occupant restraint use, and bicycle helmet use.; CONCLUSIONS: Injury risk taking behaviors appear to cluster. States with consistently poor quartile rankings should consider more concerted injury prevention efforts. Health care providers can play an important role in increasing the prevalence of injury prevention behaviors by providing age-appropriate counseling to their patients.

These show the vaccine to be safe, causing mostly only minor local symptoms and to be highly immunogenic both in monitored clinical trials and under field conditions. Engerix-B consistently elicits high geometric mean antibody titres and a high protective efficacy has been established in three groups at high-risk of hepatitis B infection, homosexual men, institutionalised mentally handicapped subjects and neonates of chronic carrier mothers. The profile of the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in certain high-risk groups and immuno compromised people is discussed. Finally we present updated post marketing surveillance data based on 496 million distributed doses of vaccine.

AB Although codeine is a widely used medication, the problems of codeine abuse and dependence have not been well-studied. This study characterized regular codeine users (using at least 3 days per week for 6 months, excluding those using codeine for the treatment of cancer pain) through a self-completed questionnaire. Recruitment through newspaper advertisements resulted in a total of 339 eligible questionnaires. Thirty-seven percent of subjects met DSM-IV criteria for codeine dependence. Dependent subjects (mean age, 40 +/- 10 years) were using an average of 179 (+/-171) mg of codeine per day. Codeine was predominantly used in the form of combination products with acetaminophen. Dependent subjects identified specific problems causally related to their codeine use such as depression (23%), anxiety (21%), and gastrointestinal disturbances (13%). The dependent subjects reported problems with other drugs more than did nondependent users (alcohol, 57% vs. 26%; cannabis, 23% vs. 5%; sedative/hypnotics, 33% vs. 12%; and heroin, 11% vs. 2%, respectively). Most were taking codeine primarily for a chronic pain problem (81%), although the dependent subjects currently found codeine less effective for treating pain than did the nondependent subjects and were more likely to use codeine for pleasurable effects, to relax, or to prevent withdrawal symptoms. This study showed that dependence is associated with the regular use of codeine. Pain is a key issue with these users; however, they are probably not receiving optimal treatment. There is a need to identify individuals experiencing problems with their codeine use and to develop optimal prevention and treatment strategies.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the spread of HIV into rural areas.; METHODS: Since 1994 a demographic surveillance system (with 5-monthly rounds) and open adult cohort study have been established in a rural ward in Tanzania. Two sero-surveys of all resident adults aged 15-44 and 15-46 years were conducted in 1994 1995 and 1996-1997 respectively. Qualitative data were collected on mobility, bars and commercial sex.; RESULTS: Attendance of the two rounds of survey was 5820 (78%) and 6413 (80%) in 1994/1995 and 1996/1997 respectively. HIV prevalence increased from 5.8% to 6.6%. HIV incidence was 0.73 and 0.84 per 100 person years among men and women respectively. HIV incidence under the age of 20 years was low among both sexes. Striking differences in HIV prevalence and incidence were observed within the small geographic area studied: HIV prevalence in the trading center was twice that in the area surrounding the trading center (within 2 km) and three to four times that in the rural villages (within 8 km of the trading center). Aggregate level data showed significant differences between the trading center and nearby rural villages in terms of sexual behavior, commercial sex workers, mobility of the population, and alcohol use.; CONCLUSION: This study documents the existence of very substantial HIV prevalence and incidence differences within a small geographic rural area. The rapid decrease in HIV prevalence within a small rural area emphasizes the importance of concentrating HIV prevention efforts on high transmission areas, such as trading centers, especially in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, this has considerable implications for monitoring the spread of HIV through sentinel sites, as such sites are typically located in high transmission areas.

Statistically significant associations were observed between the reported frequency of taking substances and the perceived social/contextual and/or mood altering functions cited for their consumption. The substance use function measures together with the reported extent of peer use were significant predictors of intentions to use again.; CONCLUSIONS: If these findings are confirmed in larger studies, educational and preventative efforts may need to acknowledge the positive personal and social functions which different substances serve for young people. The results also call into question the extent to which the experience of negative effects influences future patterns of use.

AB To examine whether there is a tendency for individuals to be multiply addicted, overlapping addictions to common substances (alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, cigarettes) and activities (exercise, gambling, Internet use, television, video games) were studied in 129 college men and women. Contrary to previous research, moderate to large correlations were found, both within and between substances and activities. Self-esteem was positively related to exercise but unrelated to the remaining addictions. Several gender differences in addictive tendencies were also revealed: Men scored higher than women on addiction to alcohol, cigarettes, gambling, television, and Internet use, but women scored higher on caffeine and chocolate. The results have implications for theories of addiction and suggest new directions for the study of addiction among normally functioning young adults.

AB BACKGROUND: There are substantial sex differences in all levels of alcohol involvement among U.S. adults. The goal of this study was to test whether the magnitude and sources of genetic and environmental influences on liability for alcohol abuse and dependence differ for men and women.; METHODS: Structured personal interviews were used to assess DSM-III-R- and DSM-IV-defined alcohol abuse and dependence among 5091 male and 4168 female twins (including 1546 identical, 1128 same-sex fraternal, and 1423 opposite-sex pairs) born in Virginia between 1934 and 1974. Twin correlations were analyzed using structural equation modeling.; RESULTS: The magnitude of twin-pair resemblance was similar across several definitions of alcoholism and was substantially higher among identical than fraternal pairs. The proportion of population variation in liability attributed to genetic factors was substantial among both women (55-66%) and men (51-56%), and we found little evidence of a role of environmental factors shared by family members. In all definitions studied, we could reject a model that the genetic sources of liability in the two sexes overlap completely.; CONCLUSION: In this first population-based study of alcoholism among male and female twins from the U.S., we found that genetic factors play a major role in the development of alcoholism in both sexes, that the magnitudes of genetic influence were equally high for men and women, and that the genetic sources of vulnerability are partially, but not completely, overlapping in men and women.

By logistic regression done on boys and girls separately, suicide attempts were associated with friends or family members attempting or completing suicide; somatic symptoms; physical or sexual abuse; health concerns; using alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs; a history of being in a special education class; treatment for emotional problems; gang involvement; and gun availability. For male and female youth, discussing problems with friends or family, emotional health, and connectedness to family were protective against suicide attempts. The estimated probability of attempting suicide increased dramatically as the number of risk factors to which an adolescent was exposed increased; however, increasing protective factors was more effective at reducing the probability of a suicide attempt than was decreasing risk factors.; CONCLUSIONS: A history of attempted suicide was associated with several risk and protective factors. In addition to targeting youth at increased risk, preventive efforts should include promotion of protective factors in the lives of all youth in this population.

AB CONTEXT: Data on the prevalence of HIV risk behavior that are representative of the general population are needed to help evaluate the effectiveness of prevention programs.; OBJECTIVE: To use data from a large national interview survey to make estimates of the prevalence of sexual and drug-related HIV risk behaviors in the adult population of the United States.; DESIGN: Nationally representative cross-sectional survey with in-person interviews collecting information on drug use and sexual behavior.; SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 12,381 U.S. adults aged between 18 and 59 who were respondents to the 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, as part of sample of the noninstitutionalized population. Interviews took place in respondents homes using face-to-face interviewer-administered and self-administered questionnaires.; RESULTS: In total, 2.8% of respondents were classified as having increased risk for HIV through sexual behavior; this represents 3.9 million persons. 1.7% reported some degree of risk through drug-related behaviors, representing 1.2 million persons. 3.5% of adults (5 million persons) were found to have some degree of HIV risk from sexual or drug-related behavior. Persons who were at risk through drug behavior were much more likely than others to be at risk through sexual behavior. Condom use was not related to HIV risk, although having a recent HIV test was found to be. Among those who reported some behaviors that placed them at increased risk for HIV infection, only 22% used a condom the last time they had sex with a regular partner.; CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of sexual risk behavior on the part of drug users suggests increasing condom use for this group should be a priority goal for programs, especially condom use with main partners. Survey work needs to be continued and improved to make it possible to assess the impact of successful local prevention efforts on national rates of HIV risk behavior.

AB The aim of this study is to identify social factors that could be related to differential rates of mortality decline for men and women in Sweden. The annual changes in fifteen indicators and their relationship with changes in absolute excess male mortality were analyzed by means of time series analysis for the period 1945-1992. Economic growth seems to have been more beneficial for women's survival than for that of men. A few labor market indicators (unemployment rate and the wage ratio men/women) may have had some influence on changes in excess male mortality as well. Consumption factors, such as alcohol consumption and cigarette consumption, have been important for changes in excess male mortality. Changes in excess male mortality have been particularly pronounced among 65-74 year olds, due to rapidly improved female survival in these age groups. I discuss the finding that there seem to be connections between, on the one hand, changes in general social factors such as economic growth and labor market factors, and perhaps urbanization and alcohol and cigarette consumption on the other. I therefore suggest that gender-specific consumer behavior, seen as an outcome of gender-specific norm systems, is one mechanism which links changes in general social factors to changes in excess male mortality.

AB Twin studies have demonstrated that addictive disorders are genetically and environmentally influenced. Our knowledge of behavioral differences predisposing to addiction is advancing rapidly, particularly in alcoholism but also in the other addictions, through studies on animals and humans. Recently, linkage analyses in humans and rodents have pointed to genomic regions harboring genes which influence addiction or drug-associated behaviors. There is increasing evidence that the addictions have common as well as distinct neurobiological pathways. These advances in the understanding of the genetics of addictive disorders should facilitate the development of specific pharmacotherapies and the more accurate targeting of therapies using molecular diagnostic approaches.

AB BACKGROUND: There have been no studies of the prevalence, characteristics, and factors associated with the history of prior farm injury among active farmers. No studies have had adequate numbers of black farmers to evaluate farm owner/farm worker and black/white similarities and differences.; METHODS: Our sample is based upon surveys administered to 1,310 active male farmers in nine rural counties in Alabama (5) and Mississippi (4). The farmers are white owner/operators (53.6%), black owner/operators (26.6%), and black workers (19.8%).; RESULTS: Overall, 23.4% of the farmers had a prior injury. Prior injury was more frequent among white owner/operators (29.1%), compared with black workers (18.9%), and black owner/operators (15.2%). In multiple logistic regression analyses, post-high school education and tiredness when farming were independently associated with prior injury in black owner/operators. In white owner/operators, age > or = 60 years, post-high school education, full-time farming, tractor use, more pieces of machinery, hurry when farming, and alcohol consumption were associated with prior injury. In black workers, only being very careful was associated with prior injury.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that prevention efforts focusing on alcohol consumption, fatigue, and hurry when farming might reduce injuries; however, only a follow-up study of this sample can determine whether these associations reflect causal factors, recall, or selection bias.

AB INTRODUCTION: Persons who drive after drinking or ride with drinking drivers are at increased risk of motor vehicle crash. Although alcohol is involved in 40% of fatal motor vehicle crashes yearly, there exist few systems to monitor alcohol-impaired driving. In this study we compare driver- and passenger-based estimates of the prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving.; DESIGN: A random-digit-dialing telephone survey of the United States. Participants were adults aged 18 or older who were English- or Spanish-speaking from 5238 households (response rate = 56.1%).; RESULTS: From the 4603 respondents who reported driving in the preceding 30 days, we estimate that there were 126 million drinking-driving episodes in the United States in 1994. From the 4380 passengers in the preceding 30 days, we estimate 191 million episodes. Three percent of respondents self-reported as drinking drivers (4.8% of males and 1.3% of females) and 4.9% as passengers of drinking drivers. Drinking drivers were more likely to be passengers of drinking drivers (44% versus 4% of nondrinking drivers). Drinking drivers were also more than twice as likely to report drinking daily, and only one half as likely to report always wearing their safety belts.; CONCLUSION: Passengers who report riding with a drinking driver may provide an important estimate of the prevalence of drinking driving. Passengers of drinking drivers represent a high-risk group that is not considered in most prevention efforts. Because being a passenger of a drinking driver is not illegal, it may be an easier topic for clinicians to broach than drinking and driving.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study reports prevalences of lifetime and current alcohol, tobacco and drug use in adolescents; examines associations between substance use and a number of putative risk factors; and estimates the contribution of genetic, shared and unique environmental influences on substance use.; METHOD: Substance use data were collected using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment on a population sample of 1,412 male and female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, aged 8 through 16, from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development.; RESULTS: Heritabilities were estimated to be 84% and 82% for liability to lifetime and current tobacco use, respectively. For alcohol use the role of genes and environment varied according to the context of reporting. Liability to lifetime alcohol use was estimated to be under environmental control, with 71% of the variation shared by members of a twin pair and 29% unique to individual twins. Lifetime alcohol use without the permission of a parent or guardian and current use of alcohol were predominantly explained by genetic factors (h2 = 72% and 74%). The role of genetic factors increased and that of unique environmental factors decreased with increasing severity of alcohol use. Lifetime use of any drug showed a heritability of 45%, with the shared environment accounting for 47% of the variation. Shared environmental factors explained most of the variation in marijuana use.; CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors explained a significant proportion of the variation in the use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. Shared environmental factors contributed significantly to lifetime alcohol use and other drug use.

AB BACKGROUND: The cigarette smoking habit continues to be prevalent to a greater degree than would be desirable among teenagers. Innovative prevention programs are needed. This descriptive cross-sectional study sets out the behavior variables related to the cigarette smoking habit and the extracurricular activities in which teenagers are most frequently involved which are useful for setting out extracurricular prevention programs.; METHODS: The data was collected by means of a questionnaire validated in a representative sample of school age youths (ages 10-11 and 13-14) from Asturias. The variables entailed in cigarette smoking were analyzed using the regression method.; RESULTS: The starting smoker percentage is 14.5%-42.5%, regular smokers totaling 1.1% and 12.4%, respectively. Two models were constructed with the variables significantly related to smoking behavior, which are properly classified into smoker/non-smoker by 98.85% and 91.39% of the children, by ages. The environmental variables (availability of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages and regular visits to places entailing risk) are the major aspects comprising the model. The most common extracurricular activities are: watching TV, reading and listening to music and watching or playing sports.; CONCLUSION: The findings provide keys to planning extracurricular activities tailored to fit in with the activities most popular among teens: TV commercials and ads on music media (CD's, tapes, etc.) and printed information mailed directly to teens at their homes, with messages conveyed by opinion-leaders among teens in the fields of sports, music and television.

AB AIM: To examine the extent to which drink driving and criminal behaviour would predict receipt of disability pension and high sickness absence rates in young and middle-aged men.; DESIGN AND SETTING: A total of 8122 mandatory conscripts, born in 1950 or 1951, from the County of Stockholm were followed in a 22-year longitudinal study. Information was collected at the time of conscription for military service in 1969 and 1970. Data were linked to records on driving while intoxicated (DWI) and other criminal offences between 1970 and 1991 and to information from the Social Insurance Board.; FINDINGS: A total of 211 (2.6%) conscripts were granted a disability pension during the follow-up period between 1970 and 1991, and another 373 (4.6%) conscripts had high sickness absence (at least 180 sick days between 1989 and 1991). A total of 642 men had one or more DWI offences from the time of conscription until 1992. The median number of sick-days/sick-listed between 1989 and 1991 was 35.0 for men who were problem drinkers at conscription, 60.3 for drink drivers, 31.0 for men with less serious and 53.0 for men with serious crimes, compared to 21.0 days for the group as whole. In bivariate regression analysis, drink driving implied a relative risk (RR) of a disability pension/high sickness absence of 3.4 (95% CI: 2.8-4.1), and criminality a RR of 3.6 (95% CI: 3.1-4.1). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, controlling for psychosocial factors from conscription and for criminality, drink driving remained a strong predictor (RR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.7-2.7).; CONCLUSIONS: Problem drinking, drink driving and criminality are important risk factors for receipt of disability pension and high levels of sickness absence in young men. The findings suggest that preventive efforts undertaken at the time of conscription and during later military service may pay dividends in term of preventing problems later in life.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the influences related to social mobility, particularly health related behaviours, as one potential explanation for the social class variation in health among adults.; DESIGN: The study is based on questionnaire data from the Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Surveys of 1985, 1987, and 1989.; SETTING: The whole of Finland.; PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of 8355 adolescents. The response rate was 79%.; MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The relation between social mobility and health related behaviours among 16 and 18 year old young people was studied. The measure of social mobility was based on a combination of the social class of origin and achieved social position measured by the present educational status, educational attainment, and labour market position. Three mobility groups were constructed: the downwardly mobile, the upwardly mobile and the stable. Health related behaviours in an upwardly or downwardly mobile group were compared with a stable group from the same social class of origin by calculating relative risks (RR). RRs were assessed by calculating age and sex adjusted rate ratios approximating a Mantel-Haenszel estimate. In logistic regression analyses the independent effects of the social class of origin and the achieved social position were investigated. Most of the nine behaviours studied (smoking, alcohol use, heavy intoxication, coffee drinking, tooth brushing, consumption of sweets, lack of physical exercise, choice of bread spread, and consumption of milk) were related to the direction of mobility so that health compromising behaviours were more frequent among downwardly mobile and less frequent among upwardly mobile young people than their stable peers. Achieved social position proved to determine health related behaviours more strongly than class of origin, thus emphasising the way education facilitates both health values and behaviours as well as the future social position.; CONCLUSIONS: The close relation between social mobility and health related behaviours is concluded to be a part of an explanation of social class differences in health observed among adults.

AB The US government's Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) launched its new antidrug media campaign in July 1998. The campaign is likely to increase awareness of the youth drug problem, but shortcomings in the campaign's early implementation raise questions about its potential for changing behavior. Shortcomings include: a) The first wave of ONDCP's television advertisements are focused on reinforcing problem awareness but do not model skills or provide other information necessary for behavior change; b) the campaign provides insufficient focus on promoting drug treatment and citizen involvement in local prevention activities, including political action; c) the campaign is being implemented without a major new investment in drug-treatment programs or community-based prevention programs; d) The campaign does not substantively address alcohol and tobacco, which pose a clear threat to health and serve as a "gateway" to illicit drug use; and e) the first wave of television advertisements use exaggerated fear appeals, a strategy shown by research rarely to be successful. Only time will tell whether the ONDCP media campaign will succeed or fail. Using past research as a guide, there is legitimate reason for concern that the campaign will not live up to expectations.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examined early school-based academic and social variables with concurrent family conflict in predicting adolescent alcohol and other drug use.; METHOD: 365 children were assessed initially in grades 2-4 on academic-related and social behavior variables using teacher ratings and rankings, peer nominations and ratings and direct observation of playground and classroom behavior. They were reassessed in grades 9-10, using interviews and questionnaires to determine the initiation and sequence of their use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and other hard drugs.; RESULTS: In three sets of analyses, independently for males and females, lifetime abstainers were compared with adolescents who had used (1) only alcohol; (2) alcohol and tobacco; (3) alcohol, tobacco and marijuana; and (4) all three plus other hard drugs. The drug classifications represent a normative-deviant continuum of adolescent drug use. Constructs were developed for early academic and social predictors as well as concurrent family conflict. The results showed more wide-ranging academic and social difficulties during elementary school for children falling at the more deviant end of the drug use continuum. For girls, the concurrent home environment appeared to moderate the effect of early academic and social variables.; CONCLUSIONS: Substance use established by ages 14-15 can be predicted by academic and social behavior displayed at ages 7-9. This suggests that prevention efforts for alcohol and other drugs may be more effective if directed at earlier antecedent behaviors rather than those that are concurrent with substance use.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study identifies, in genetically informative data, familial and socioregional environmental influences on abstinence from alcohol at age 16.; METHOD: Data are from FinnTwin 16, a population-based study of five consecutive birth cohorts of Finnish twins (N = 5,747 twin individuals), yielding 2,711 pairs of known zygosity. Measures of alcohol use, embedded into a health-habits questionnaire, were taken from earlier epidemiological research with nontwin Finnish adolescents. The questionnaire was administered sequentially to all twins as they reached age 16. Separate questionnaires, including measures of alcohol use and screening questions for alcohol problems, were received from 5,243 of the twins' parents.; RESULTS: Abstinence from alcohol to age 16 exhibits very significant familial aggregation, largely due to nongenetic influences. Abstinence rates are influenced by socioregional variation, sibling interaction effects and parental drinking patterns. Sibling and parental influences are greater in some regional environments than in others: the relative likelihood that a twin abstains, given that the co-twin does, or that both parents do, is shown to be modulated by socioregional variation.; CONCLUSION: Environmental contexts affect the likelihood of maintaining abstinence from alcohol to midadolescence, and socioregional variation modulates influences of siblings and parents. The results illustrate how genetically informative data can inform prevention research by identifying target variables for intervention efforts.

AB OBJECTIVE: Research indicates a marriage effect with respect to drinking and drinking problems. This effect is characterized by less consumption and fewer problems among married men and women as compared with either single or divorced individuals.; METHOD: This article reviews evidence regarding processes that might account for the marriage effect.; RESULTS: The literature suggests that the marriage effect reflects three processes: (1) reduced alcohol consumption triggered by the transition to marriage, (2) the deleterious effect of heavy drinking on marital quality and marital stability and (3) increased consumption in response to the transition to divorce.; CONCLUSIONS: Given the nature of these transitions, it is argued that transitions to marriage and divorce should be viewed as unique opportunities for adult prevention activities, but that more pre-prevention research focused on changes over these transitions is needed to help target prevention efforts.

AB This paper is the result of a collaborative project of Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian scientists gathered to reveal the current extent of substance abuse and efforts at prevention among Arabs in Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority territories, in order to identify needs and suggest future collaborative activities and directions for regional cooperation. The article provides data and covers the current state of substance abuse prevention and research among Moslems, Christians and Druze in the trilateral region in the 1990s by reviewing prevention materials and studies published in the professional literature, as well as in reports and Doctoral and Master's theses in Arabic, which have been located in academic libraries and other institutions, in the framework of a comprehensive search. This manuscript is the first to summarize Jordanian and Palestinian findings in the substance abuse domain. The review shows that most of the Israeli research in the Arab sector deals with alcohol use among youth, that the majority of Jordanian studies focus on illicit drug use, that the research among Palestinians is in its infancy, and that comprehensive prevention programs are lacking in the trilateral region. It describes the key results of most of the 12 Israeli studies among Arabs, 11 Jordanian studies and four Palestinian studies. It reveals that drug abuse among Israeli Arab students is probably more prevalent than among Jewish adolescents, that the typical Jordanian drug addict has a higher level of education than the typical Palestinian drug addict, and that the Palestinian is more likely to be a multiple drug user. Recommendations for future activities include organization of a regional collaborative workshop in order to establish data collection systems for basic statistics relevant to drug abuse and development of comprehensive prevention programs, as well as studies in the substance abuse domain concerning knowledge, attitudes and behavior among the general Arab population.

AB Our project was conducted to determine if the deleterious effects of chronic alcohol consumption on growing bone are reversible if the adolescent stops drinking. Four-week old, female, Sprague-Dawley rats were housed and maintained in an AAALAC-accredited facility. Six animals each were placed on alcohol-fed (35% ethanol-derived calories), pair-fed or chow-fed diets for 2 or 4 weeks. A recovery group of six animals was alcohol-fed for 2 weeks followed by an additional 2 weeks of chow feeding. This group was pair-fed to an additional group of six animals that received liquid diet, pair fed to the recovery group for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks on a pair-fed chow diet. Blood alcohol concentrations averaged 309 +/- 9 mg/dl. Morphological parameters of the femur, such as length, diameter, and volume were smaller in alcohol treated animals at both 2 and 4 weeks of feeding. Femur length and volume of recovery alcohol-fed animals were more than either 2- or 4-week alcohol-fed animals, but they were not as great as the same-age 4-week pair-fed or chow-fed animals. Diameter was similar to the 4-week alcohol-fed, but less than the chow-fed. Femur density was reduced at all time periods in the alcohol-fed animals. The recovery alcohol-fed animals had greater density than the 2-week alcohol, but not the 4-week alcohol-fed animals. They did not, however, reach 4-week chow- or pair-fed levels. Tibia BV/TV was reduced in the 2- and 4-week alcohol- and pair-fed animals. BV/TV was greater in the recovery animals than either 2- or 4-week alcohols, but not as great as the chow-fed animals. At 2 weeks, calorie deprivation caused a reduction in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that was reduced even more by alcohol. By 4 weeks, the calorie deprivation was no longer seen, but alcohol continued to reduce the values. Two weeks of alcohol followed by 2 weeks of chow diet returned the IGF-1 values to almost normal, but significantly different levels. The apparent improvement was probably due to continued growth of the young bones and not a regaining of bone lost during alcohol consumption.

AB OBJECTIVES: This article describes the implementation and impact of the first statewide condom social marketing intervention in the United States.; METHODS: A statewide social marketing program made condoms freely available in 93 public health clinics, 39 community mental health centers, 29 substance abuse treatment sites, and more than 1000 businesses in neighborhoods with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV. Surveys about condom use were conducted annually.; RESULTS: Between 1994 and 1996, more than 33 million condoms were distributed without significant opposition. Over time, self-reported condom use at the last sexual encounter increased among African American women (from 28% in 1994 to 36% in 1996), particularly African American women with 2 or more sex partners (from 30% to 48%). Condom use at the last sexual encounter increased among African American men (from 40% in 1994 to an average of 54% in 1996). The number of reported sex partners did not increase.; CONCLUSIONS: Condom social marketing can be successfully implemented in the United States. The widespread availability of free condoms is associated with increased condom use, particularly among persons at high risk for STDs and HIV.

AB OBJECTIVE: There has been international concern over the balance of television advertising for healthy and less-healthy foods to which children and adolescents are exposed. This study examined the extent to which 9-17 year old New Zealanders were exposed to advertising for different food groups over a year and compared New Zealand rates of advertising with a 13-country study.; METHOD: 'People meter' data collected over three months--May and September 1995 and February 1996--and food advertising from a sample week of television during hours when children were likely to be watching were also examined. Comparison was made with a similar 1989 South Australian study and an international study covering 13 countries.; RESULTS: Both the exposure estimated for a year and the opportunities for exposure during the sample week were highest for sweet snacks, drinks, fast food/takeaways and breakfast cereals. There were very low levels for fruit, vegetables, and meat/fish/eggs. Water was not advertised in any sample month. Comparisons with the 13-country study showed New Zealand had the third-highest rate of food advertising, the highest rate of confectionery and drinks advertising, and the second-highest rate of restaurant advertising which included fast food restaurants.; CONCLUSION: Current patterns of food advertising pose a conflict of interest between public health and commercial interests. Regulation of food advertising may be needed to address this in order to improve future health.

AB The study assessed leaders' perceptions of adolescent alcohol use as a public health issue in 28 small communities in northern Minnesota, as part of formative evaluation for a community-based intervention to reduce adolescent alcohol access and consumption. One hundred and eighteen leaders from five key community sectors were interviewed about their perceptions of social, health and alcohol-related problems in their communities. Analyses indicated that school representatives and police chiefs perceived adolescent alcohol use and related problems to be serious; newspaper editors mentioned other social problems more often; and mayors and business representatives did not perceive adolescent alcohol problems to be as serious. In relation to efforts to affect local policy, the study suggested government and business sectors in these communities may need to be educated about the problem to build its importance on the community agenda of health issues. Thus community leaders in some sectors may comprise a key target audience for intervention.

AB This study examined the maintenance of positive health behavior (avoidance of alcohol use and cigarette smoking) and factors associated with the maintenance of these behaviors from fifth through seventh grade by a cohort of rural students (N = 232). African American and White students showed similar patterns of high avoidance of alcohol until seventh grade. Although more girls avoided use than boys, avoidance decreased in both groups with progression in grade. Mothers', fathers', and best friends' drinking behaviors influenced avoidance behavior; drinking was less likely to occur among those whose parents and friends did not drink. Friends' drinking behavior influenced alcohol use as early as fifth grade. Smoking avoidance was maintained by 74% of the students over the 3 years. Although there were no racial differences in smoking, African Americans started smoking about 1 year earlier than Whites. During seventh grade, an increase in smoking occurred among boys and girls, but was particularly striking among girls. Avoidance of smoking was influenced by mothers' behavior but not fathers'. Best friends' smoking behavior exerted a major influence on avoidance between grades 6 and 7. In grades 5 and 6, those who avoided smoking were more physically active than smokers, but by seventh grade their physical activity declined to a similar level as smokers. Rural adolescent boys seemed to be at early risk for alcohol use and smoking, while rural girls delayed involvement by 1 to 2 years. Communities, schools, and families can help adolescents avoid alcohol use and smoking through early prevention efforts.

AB The article gives an account of the results of a research intended to know violence reported by individual between couples and towards children and also to establish the importance of social (sex, income, education, civil status, work status, gun license, alcohol abuse, attraction to violent TV programs) and cultural (social norms about aggression between couples and children punishment, and capacity to express anger and handle conflicts in a non-violent ways) predictors in such behavior. The information is based on a survey applied to Caracas Metropolitan Area (CMA) inhabitants between 18 and 70 years of age (n = 1,297) selected by probabilistic, biphasic, and tetra-stage sampling, and at random following the Politz method. The instrument was a questionnaire with on scale answers Likert type. The information was treated with multi-varying statistical analysis, using the association technique between two variables by means of the Chi-square test, with conditional independence log-linear for three variables. The results suggest relatively low violence levels between couples and towards children. Regarding children, women tend to be more violent with them, most probably explained by factors relating income and unemployment. It was found that the bigger the accord with the norm to discipline children with physical violence, the bigger the frequency of violent behavior towards them. On the contrary, the bigger the conviction to be skilled in handling situations without violence, the lesser the frequency of violent behavior. Regarding violence between couples no association was found with the sex variable, but one can certainly talk about violent couples, which is related to the way of coupling, unemployment, and lack of formal education. From the norm point of view, a relationship between belief in the norms and violent behavior is observed, although these norms and attitudes are measured by the ability of the couple of control himself/herself and act in a non-violent way.

AB Over 70% of human cancers are associated with lifestyle and about half of cancer deaths could be prevented by relatively simple individual actions: no smoking, moderate consumption of alcohol, increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, avoidance of sunbathing, obesity and a too high consumption of saturated lipids. Most of these efforts would also markedly decrease the incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, the concept of prevention is currently neither well accepted nor understood by the medical community and the general public. It is often felt that it restricts freedom, imposes a choice between pleasure and duty, and that passing judgement on lifestyle is a form of intolerance. The case of tobacco illustrates the difficulties encountered by prevention, notably among adolescents. The fight against smoking requires information, a societal approach (ban on advertising, increase in price), and a reduction of the example given by adult smoking (parents, peers, teachers, physicians, TV presenters, movie stars, have a great influence on adolescents), while tobacco cessation programs must be promoted. The various approaches should be integrated into a global program of health prevention, including health education at school from 5 to 12 years of age. The efficacy of each of the global program's components should be evaluated. Misconceptions such as overestimation of the impact of pollution on health should also be corrected. Health is created and experienced by people within the setting of their daily lives, in particular during childhood. Prevention is the responsibility of individual members of the community but also of the community as a whole.

AB Alcohol consumption has been found to be associated with injury occurrence and with risk-taking dispositions, and these dispositions, themselves, have been found to be associated with injury. Few studies have analyzed both alcohol consumption and risk-taking dispositions, or illicit drug use, on risk of injury across all types of injuries. Data on risk perception, risk-taking/impulsivity, sensation seeking, alcohol and drug use, demographic characteristics, and injury in the last year are reported from the 1995 National Alcohol Survey of 4925 respondents living in households in the 48 contiguous states. Moderate drinking, alcohol treatment, drug use, simultaneous use of alcohol and drugs, and risk-taking dispositions were all positively associated with reporting an injury. In multiple logistic regression, only risk-taking dispositions maintained significance when other variables were controlled. In separate regressions by ethnicity, risk-taking dispositions were significant predictors of injury for whites, whereas none of the variables were significant for blacks or Hispanics. Data suggest that risk-taking dispositions may be more important predictors of injury than either drinking or drug use variables, but this may vary by ethnicity. Risk-taking disposition may influence the effectiveness of strategies to reduce alcohol-related injuries; future research is important, therefore, for informing intervention and prevention efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: A comprehensive surveillance system for occupational injuries to adolescents does not exist in Texas, as in most states. Therefore, the magnitude, severity, nature, and source of injuries to working adolescents have not been well described in Texas.; METHODS: The investigators used three data sources to investigate work-related injuries and deaths in Texas: (1) Texas Workers' Compensation Commission (TWCC) claims data from 1991 through April 1996; (2) 1993 TWCC/Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Annual Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses; and (3) work-related fatalities identified from Texas death certificates from 1990-1995.; RESULTS: There were 9,027 injuries reported to the TWCC for adolescents 14-17 years of age during slightly more than 5 years. Injuries for which indemnity payments were made (more than 7 days out of work) occurred among 21.7% of the adolescents. Based on BLS data in 1993, of 992 non-fatal injuries involving days away from work, 35% were caused by contact with objects, 27% by bodily reaction, and 24% by falls. Two-thirds of these injuries occurred while working in eating and drinking places and grocery stores. Three-quarters of the 30 deaths from 1990-1995 were accounted for equally by motor vehicle and homicide.; CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a substantial number of adolescents are injured or killed in the workplace each year in Texas. Although improved population-based surveillance is needed, sufficient knowledge exists to begin prevention efforts now.

AB Psychology can and should be at the forefront of participation in social, community, and preventive interventions. This chapter focuses on selective topics under two general areas: violence as a public health problem and health promotion/competence promotion across the life span. Under violence prevention, discussion of violence against women, youth violence, and child maltreatment are the focal points. Under health and competence promotion, attention is paid to the prevention of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS. We highlight a few significant theoretical and empirical contributions, especially from the field of community/prevention psychology. The chapter includes a brief overview of diversity issues, which are integral to a comprehensive discussion of these prevention efforts. We argue that the field should extend its role in social action while emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous research as a component of future interventions.

AB This study examined the developmental associations between substance use and violence. We examined the trends in each behavior throughout adolescence, how the behaviors covaried over time, and the symmetry of associations taking into account frequency and severity of each behavior. We also examined whether changes in one behavior affected changes in the other behavior over time. Six years of annual data were analyzed for 506 boys who were in the seventh grade at the first assessment. Concurrent associations between frequency of substance use and violence were relatively strong throughout adolescence and were somewhat stronger for marijuana than alcohol, especially in early adolescence. Type or severity of violence was not related to concurrent alcohol or marijuana frequency, but severity of drug use was related to concurrent violence frequency. Depending, to some degree, on the age of the subjects, the longitudinal relationships between substance use and violence were reciprocal during adolescence and slightly stronger for alcohol and violence than for marijuana and violence. Further, increases in alcohol use were related to increases in violence: however, when early alcohol use was controlled, increases in marijuana use were not related to increases in violence. Only in early adolescence was the longitudinal relationship between marijuana use and later violence especially strong. The strength of the longitudinal associations between violence and substance use did not change when common risk factors for violence and substance use were controlled. Overall, the data lend more support for a reciprocal than for a unidirectional association between substance use and violence. Prevention efforts should be directed at aggressive males who are multiple-substance users in early adolescence.

AB Social phobia was initially classified with phobic anxiety states and was believed to be quite rare, but it is now gaining due recognition as a widespread and often crippling disorder. The boundaries of social phobia merge into traits of shyness and universal performance anxiety, with symptoms commonly appearing in the teenage years. If left untreated, social phobia is a remarkably persistent condition, leading to potentially lifelong impairment in social development and occupational functioning. It may also give rise to other co-morbid disorders, particularly dysthymia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other phobic disorders, and substance abuse. Over the years, social phobia has been all too frequently viewed as a somewhat trivial, minor form of psychiatric illness and has received little clinical attention. This erroneous perception is now giving way under the mounting evidence in support of the extensive morbidity and disability associated with social phobia and the probable role of genetic and environmental influences. Furthermore, data from multiple controlled clinical trials reveal that this is a treatable condition, responding to both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. Here we examine issues to consider in the differential diagnosis of social phobia, review the goals of treatment, and summarize evidence in support of the effectiveness of individual pharmacologic treatments.

AB Drinking and driving is prevalent among college students, particularly among underage college students. Although most of these students know that drunk driving is a potentially harmful behavior, many of them still make the decision to do so. The purpose of this study was to determine why underage students drink and drive and what consequences, if any, these students fear when they engage in this behavior. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted, using the Health Belief Model as a guide for discussion topics. Participants revealed that PSAs focusing on relevant, localized consequences would have more meaning to underage college students than the more general campaigns that they reported seeing. In addition, they revealed that the consequence that they fear most is being charged with a DUI, yet current anti-drinking and driving PSAs never portray this as a possible negative consequence.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare the attitude ratings and recall scores of cigarette, alcohol, automobile, deodorant, jeans, soft drink, athletic shoe, breakfast cereal, and fast food restaurant advertisements. Male and female college students rated the advertisements of these product groups on a number of traits--adventurous, eye-catching, appealing, informative, believable, good times, recreational, effectiveness, romantic, athletic, buy product, and honesty. Drawing on their everyday experience, the students also were asked to recall as much about the advertisements from these product groups as they could. The results revealed that the rating and recall scores of the alcohol advertisements were significantly higher than those for the cigarette advertisements and among the highest of all of the advertisement groups. The female recall scores generally were significantly higher than the male recall scores. In contrast to the cigarette advertisements, the high scores of the alcohol advertisements were interpreted to be due in part to the wider distribution alcohol advertising has had. That alcohol advertising ranked among the highest of all of the advertising groups indicates that college students view alcohol advertising very favorably.

AB OBJECTIVE: The concentration of alcohol consumption in the U.S. among the heaviest drinkers is analyzed with data from two recent probability samples of the adult population.; METHOD: Pooled data from four national telephone surveys (N = 7,049; 4,784 drinkers) with uniform methodology are used for the primary analysis, and data from an in-person national household survey (N = 2,058; 1,308 drinkers) are used for confirmatory analysis. Each survey systematically measured self-reported alcohol consumption during the prior year using a "graduated frequencies" approach designed to capture drinking at a series of amount-per-day levels.; RESULTS: The two studies produced very similar estimates: the top 2.5% of drinkers by volume account for 27% and 25% of the nation's total self-reported alcohol consumption in the telephone and in-person surveys, respectively; the top 5% account for 42% and 39%; and the top 20% of drinkers account for 89% and 87% in each survey, respectively. Men were overrepresented at the highest volumes, contributing about 76% of the country's total reported consumption. Similarly, young adults aged 18 to 29 are disproportionately represented in the heaviest drinking levels; constituting 27% of the population, they account for about 45% of overall adult drinking.; CONCLUSIONS: The bulk of the alcohol reported drunk in the U.S. is consumed by a relatively small population of very heavy drinkers. Prevention policies implied by this concentration include strengthening of social norms discouraging heavy consumption, restricting marketing practices that target heavy drinkers, and implementing measures to reduce consumption by the heaviest drinkers.

AB Births in South Dakota again decreased in 1997, continuing an ongoing trend that began in 1980. Progress in 1997 was noted in the use of first trimester prenatal care and the rate of low birth weight in the State remained lower than that observed nationally. The State's infant mortality rate for 1997 showed a continuation of the favorable shift in rates of the last decade that was initiated with the progress observed in 1996. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy is higher in South Dakota than noted nationally. How and why substance abuse prevention efforts must begin during childhood is discussed in this review. Currently, the rates of smoking and alcohol use are higher among South Dakota teens than noted nationally, and have increased over the past six years. Approaches to preventing substance abuse for the sake of the health and well being of youth and their potential future children are presented.

AB OBJECTIVE: Most twin and adoption studies of alcoholism have ascertained cases through treatment settings or archival data; these subjects may differ from affected subjects identified epidemiologically. The authors studied the importance of genetic influences on risk of alcohol-related disorders in a new population-based twin sample.; METHOD: Structured personal interviews were used to assess DSM-III-R-defined and DSM-IV-defined alcohol abuse and dependence among 3,516 twins from male-male pairs born in Virginia between 1940 and 1974.; RESULTS: The magnitude of resemblance among twin pairs was similar across several definitions of alcoholism and was substantially higher among 861 identical pairs than among 653 fraternal pairs. On the basis of a liability threshold model, 48%-58% of the variation in liability was attributed to additive genetic factors, with the remainder attributed to environmental influences not shared by family members. When a treatment-based proband concordance model was used, evidence for shared environmental as well as genetic influences emerged.; CONCLUSIONS: In this first population-based study of male twins from the United States, it was found that genetic factors played a major role in the development of alcoholism among males, with similar influence for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Prior findings implicating the influence of common environment may be attributable to sampling strategy; in this population-based sample, environmental factors shared by family members appear to have had little influence on the development of alcoholism in males.

AB Recent work on HIV counselling suggests that the protection of the moral status of the recipient is a key factor in the successful uptake of advice. This study suggests it may be equally important in the uptake of health promotion messages. A discourse analysis of the talk of 20 young injecting drug users (IDUs) identified a contradiction between their asserted self-identity as careful and socially responsible injectors, and their admission of risky lending and borrowing of injecting equipment. This contradiction was resolved by the production of discourses of exoneration, differentially tailored to the moral implications of lending and of borrowing. Lenders argued a form of 'market morality' wherein it was the duty of each to accept the consequences of his/her decisions. Lenders were therefore morally exonerated since moral failure was the 'borrowers'. Borrowing was usually depicted as 'desperate measures' for which moral culpability was disavowed because of 'powerlessness'. The exception of routine borrowing, acknowledged as risky and against community norms, was accounted for in a nihilistic discourse of indifference to infection and death. The need for a 'counter discourse' around notions of community is discussed.

AB A 10-hour small-group informational and skill-building intervention was tested among patients (N = 472) attending publicly funded sexually transmitted disease clinics in Maryland, Georgia, and New Jersey. After completing a 90-minute interview concerning HIV risk behaviors, condom use self-efficacy and condom outcome expectancies, participants were randomized to either an intervention or a control condition. Participants in both conditions displayed significant reductions in unprotected encounters and number of partners and increases in condom use. No differences between treatment conditions were observed, indicating that the motivational effects of the interview may have been stronger than the effects of the intervention in this population. 
A2 Sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment services in low-income
   communities offer an effective arena for accessing those at greatest
   risk for HIV infection.  This study evaluated an intensive HIV risk
   reduction program implemented in publicly funded STD clinics in
   Maryland, Georgia, and New Jersey (US).  After completion of a 90-minute
   interview on HIV risk behaviors, condom use self-efficacy, and condom
   outcome expectancies, the 472 study participants were randomly assigned
   to either a 10-hour behavioral intervention designed to increase condom
   use self-efficacy through modeling and skill building or routine brief
   counseling.  The average age of respondents was 30.1 years; they
   reported an average of 3.2 lifetime STDs.  Participants in both the
   intervention and control groups reported significant reductions in the
   number of sexual partners and unprotected sexual encounters and
   significant increases in condom use at the 90-day follow-up interview,
   with no significant differences between groups.  Four possible
   moderators of behavior change--gender, crack or heroin use, alcohol
   problems, and child sex abuse--were not significant.  The possibility
   that the baseline interview, not the intervention, motivated the
   observed changes in sexual behavior merits consideration.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological features of poisoning deaths in adolescents in the United States.; DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of poisoning deaths in persons aged 10 to 19 years in the United States from January 1, 1979, to December 31, 1994, based on national mortality data.; STUDY POPULATION: Adolescents whose cause of death was identified as poisoning using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Nature of injury (accident vs suicide).; RESULTS: There were 4129 suicides and 3807 accidental deaths due to poisoning. Victims were most frequently male and white. However, poisoning was more often the method of suicide in adolescent girls than in boys (28.0% vs 8.7%). The number of deaths (7138 vs 798) and death rate (2.36 vs 0.28 per 100,000 population) were higher in 15- to 19-year-olds vs 10- to 14-year-olds. The distribution of substances involved was different for 10- to 14-year-olds compared with 15- to 19-year-olds and for suicides compared with accidents. Among 10- to 14-year-olds, drugs other than alcohol accounted for 232 (85.3%) of 272 suicides but only 118 (22.4%) of 526 accidental deaths. Gases and vapors played an important role in accidental deaths and suicides in 15- to 19-year-olds and in accidents in 10- to 14-year-olds.; CONCLUSIONS: The rates of suicides and accidental poisoning deaths were lower in 10- to 14-year-olds compared with 15- to 19-year-olds. Areas where injury-prevention efforts might have an influence on adolescent fatalities include management of depression, substance abuse education, and use of carbon monoxide detectors or shutoff switches.

AB Burns are a significant health problem in Brazil, but there have been few data collected that could shape treatment and prevention programs. To help overcome that knowledge gap, this study looked at the types of accidents and the characteristics of 138 burn patients admitted into the burn unit of the University of Sao Paulo Hospital in Ribeirao Preto, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between November, 1991, and December, 1993. Patient charts were reviewed to collect data on age, sex, region of the body affected, burn depth and surface affected, agent causing the burn, and circumstances in which the burn happened. Of the 138 cases, 71% occurred in the home. In 50% of all accidents the victims were children. Boiling water was the agent responsible for 59% of the accidents among children younger than 3 years of age; fuel alcohol used in the home for cooking and other purposes caused 57% of the accidents among children between 7 and 11 years, the most affected pediatric group. Among adults, the group between 20 and 39 years of age was the most affected (23%); 84% of the victims in this age group were male. Seventeen percent of all cases involved adult males at work. Women suffered burns in accidents at home (67%) and in suicide-related events (33%). Seventy-five percent of the suicide cases were women. The strategies to reduce the incidence of burn injuries should aim at eliminating environmental risk factors and implementing educational programs disseminated through radio and television.

AB Traffic safety researchers have long known that the majority of fatal crashes occur on rural roads, but it is not clear whether these crashes involve people who live in rural areas or residents of urban areas traveling on rural roads. 'Geodemographic' market-research tools allow determination of the urbanization of drivers' residence locations from their postal 'zip code.' Using data from the 1988-1992 files of the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), this study determined the residence location of several subgroups of drivers involved in fatal crashes. Not only did the majority of fatal crashes occur in rural areas, but the majority of fatal crashes involved rural and small-town residents and the majority of the rural and small-town residents involved in fatal crashes were traveling on rural roads.

AB Twins were recruited through alcohol and drug treatment programs. With structural equation modeling, genetic and environmental estimates were obtained for use and DSM-III abuse/dependence of sedatives, opioids, cocaine, stimulants, and cannabis as well as any illicit drug. Analyses were conducted separately for males and females. Models included thresholds based on population prevalence of use or abuse/dependence and ever having been in treatment. Genetic influences were found for most measures. They were generally stronger for males than females and for clinical diagnoses of abuse/dependence compared to use. Common environmental influences played a greater role in use than abuse/dependence.

AB OBJECTIVE: Alcohol use is frequently portrayed in television programming and advertising. Exposure to media portrayals of alcohol use may lead to increased drinking. To address this issue, we examined prospectively the associations between media exposure and alcohol use in adolescents.; DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Setting. Six public high schools in San Jose, California. Participants. Ninth-grade students (N = 1533; mean age = 14.6 years).; OUTCOME MEASURES: Students reported hours of television, music video, and videotape viewing; computer and video game use; and lifetime and past 30 days' alcohol use at baseline and 18 months later. Associations between baseline media exposure and subsequent alcohol use were examined with multiple logistic regression.; RESULTS: During the 18-month follow-up, 36.2% of baseline nondrinkers began drinking and 50.7% of baseline drinkers continued to drink. Onset of drinking was significantly associated with baseline hours of television viewing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.01-1.18), music video viewing (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1. 17-1.47), and videotape viewing (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.79-0.99), controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and other media use. Computer and video game use was not significantly associated with the subsequent onset of drinking. Among baseline drinkers, there were no significant associations between baseline media use and maintenance of drinking.; CONCLUSIONS: Increased television and music video viewing are risk factors for the onset of alcohol use in adolescents. Attempts to prevent adolescent alcohol use should address the adverse influences of alcohol use in the media.

AB Heavy maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Although these alcohol-related defects are entirely preventable, the factors associated with maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy are complex and often resistant to change. In addition, not all women who drink heavily will produce children with FAS. Although targeting primary prevention efforts to all women at risk for drinking during pregnancy is ideal, limited resources require targeting women at the highest risk for producing children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. One such population is women who have already given birth to an alcohol-affected child. This high-risk population is not easily identified because not all children with FAS have their condition diagnosed, and these birth mothers are often separated from their children during the first few years of the child's life, often before a diagnosis of FAS has been considered. However, once identified, these women are receptive to intervention. To identify a population of women at highest risk for a future alcohol-exposed pregnancy through diagnosing a previously affected birth child, researchers at the University of Washington developed the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN). This report summarizes the results of this program and documents the feasibility of identifying persons who may have FAS so their condition can be diagnosed and their birth mothers can be identified and referred to prevention services.

AB AIMS: To assess the effectiveness of interventions directed at the prevention or reduction of use of illicit substances by young people or those directed at reducing harm caused by continuing use.; DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted. Reports were identified through electronic and hand searching and contact with known workers in the area. Studies were included if they reported evaluations of interventions targeting illicit drug use and provided sufficient detail of the intervention and design of the evaluation to allow judgements to be made of their methodological soundness. Meta-analyses were conducted combining the data of the methodologically sound studies. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS TARGETED BY INTERVENTIONS: Evaluations of interventions were included if their targeted audience included young people aged between 8 and 25 years. Identified evaluations were delivered in a range of settings including: schools and colleges; community settings; the family; medical/therapeutic settings; mass media.; MEASUREMENTS: Data extracted from each report included details of design, content and theoretical orientation of intervention, setting of the intervention, target audience, methods, population size, subject refusal rates, rates of attrition, outcome measures, length of follow-up and findings, including statistical power.; FINDINGS: The majority of studies identified were evaluations of interventions introduced in schools and targeting alcohol, tobacco and marijuana simultaneously. These studies were methodologically stronger than interventions targeting other drugs and implemented outside schools. Meta-analyses showed that the impact of evaluated interventions was small with dissipation of programme gains over time. Interventions targeting hard to reach groups have not been evaluated adequately.; CONCLUSIONS: Effort needs to be directed towards the development of improved evaluative solutions to the problems posed by these groups. There is still insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of the range of approaches to drugs education; more methodologically sound evaluations are required. There is also a need to target interventions to reflect the specific needs and experiences of recipients.

AB BACKGROUND: Although research on the association between temperament and psychopathology has received renewed interest, few investigations have addressed the issues of psychiatric comorbidity or the role of temperament across the life span. The present investigation employed a family study/high-risk design to examine the specificity of associations between temperamental traits and psychiatric disorders in both children and adults.; METHODS: The sample was composed of 244 probands and 82 children (ages 7-17) from the Yale Family Study of Comorbidity of Substance Abuse and Anxiety. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using structured diagnostic interviews administered by clinicians, and temperament was measured using the Dimensions of Temperament Survey.; RESULTS: In both adults and children, anxiety and depression were generally associated with low scores on adaptability and approach/withdrawal, while externalizing or substance use disorders were associated with low attention scores and higher activity. However, psychiatric comorbidity was associated with the manifestation of both clusters of temperamental traits and far greater impairment and clinical severity. Some temperamental characteristics in children also demonstrated specificity of association with parental psychiatric disorder.; LIMITATIONS: This investigation was limited to the analysis of cross-sectional data and was unable to separate genetic from other familial risk factors.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that temperament remains associated with psychopathology across the life span and may reflect diverse familial influences. Clinical intervention and prevention efforts may benefit from focusing on individuals at higher risk for psychiatric disorder through parental psychopathology or the expression of temperament problems in childhood.

AB PROBLEM/CONDITION: School health education (e.g., classroom training) is an essential component of school health programs; such education promotes the health of youth and improves overall public health.; REPORTING PERIOD: February-May 1996.; DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The School Health Education Profiles monitor characteristics of health education in middle or junior high schools and senior high schools. The Profiles are school-based surveys conducted by state and local education agencies. This report summarizes results from 35 state surveys and 13 local surveys conducted among representative samples of school principals and lead health education teachers. The lead health education teacher is the person who coordinates health education policies and programs within a middle or junior high school and senior high school.; RESULTS: During the study period, almost all schools in states and cities required health education in grades 6-12; of these, a median of 87.6% of states and 75.8% of cities taught a separate health education course. The median percentage of schools that tried to increase student knowledge on certain topics (i.e., prevention of tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, other sexually transmitted diseases, violence, or suicide; dietary behaviors and nutrition; and physical activity and fitness) was > 72% for each of these topics. The median percentage of schools that tried to improve certain student skills (i.e., communication, decision making, goal setting, resisting social pressures, nonviolent conflict resolution, stress management, and analysis of media messages) was > 69% for each of these skills. The median percentage of schools that had a health education teacher coordinate health education was 33.0% across states and 26.8% across cities. Almost all schools taught HIV education as part of a required health education course (state median: 94.3%; local median: 98.1%), and more than half (state median: 69.5%; local median: 82.5%) had a written policy on HIV infection among students and school staff. A median of 41.0% of schools across states and a median of 25.8% of schools across cities had a lead health education teacher with professional preparation in health and physical education, and < 25% of schools across states or cities had a lead health education teacher with professional preparation in health education only. Across states, the median percentage of schools, whose lead health education teacher had received in-service training on certain health education topics, ranged from 15.6% for suicide prevention to 51.4% for HIV prevention; across cities, the median percentage ranged from 26.2% for suicide prevention to 76.1% for HIV prevention. A median of 19.7% of schools across states and 18.1% of schools across cities had a school health advisory council. Of the schools that received parental feedback (state median: 59.1%; local median: 54.2%), > 78% reported receiving positive feedback.; INTERPRETATION: More than 75% of schools have a required course in health education to help provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to adopt healthy lifestyles.; ACTIONS TAKEN: The School Health Education Profiles data are being used by state and local education officials to improve school health education and HIV education.

AB BACKGROUND: We conducted an exploratory multivariate analysis of juvenile behavior symptoms in an adoption data set. One goal was to see if a few DSM-interpretable symptom dimensions economically captured information within the data. A second goal was to study the relationships between any such dimensions, biological and environmental background, and eventual adult antisocial behavior.; METHODS: The data originated from a retrospective adoption study. Probands with a biological background for parental antisocial personality or alcoholism were heavily oversampled. Symptoms were ascertained by proband and adoptive parent interview. We performed, by gender, orthogonal rotated principal component analyses of juvenile behavior disturbance symptoms (females, n = 87; males, n = 88). We used structural equation modeling to examine the relationships hypothesized above.; RESULTS: For both genders, an oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) component and at least 1 conduct component emerged. Regardless of the conduct component scores, the ODD components were significant predictors of adult antisocial behavior. For males, the ODD component was predicted by an antisocial biological background, but not by scores on the Adverse Adoptive Environment Scale. The conduct components were predicted by adoptive environment alone. For females, biological background or biological-environmental interactions predicted each of the components.; CONCLUSIONS: There has been little previous distinction between conduct disorder and ODD in studies of genetic and environmental influences on juvenile behavior. The study suggests that adolescent ODD symptoms may be a distinct antecedent of adult antisocial personality. In males, adolescent ODD symptoms may represent early expression of genetic sociopathic personality traits.

AB The genetic and environmental influences on problem behaviors at two assessment points, three years apart, and their stability were studied in a sample of international adoptees, initially aged 10 to 15 years. Parents of 111 pairs of adopted biological siblings, 221 pairs of adopted nonbiological siblings and 1484 adopted singletons completed the Child Behavior Checklist (75 pairs, 154 pairs and 1080 singletons respectively at second assessment). At first assessment, genetic factors accounted for more than 50% of the variance in the Externalizing, Aggressive Behavior, Attention Problems and Social Problems scales. Shared environmental influences explained 40% of the variance in the Total Problem scale and less for all other scales. Nonshared environmental influences were most important for the Internalizing scale and its subscales, and for the Thought Problems and Delinquent Behavior scales. At the second assessment, genetic factors explained most of the variance in the Total Problem, Externalizing and Aggressive Behavior scales, while nonshared environmental influences explained most of the variance in all other scales. Shared environmental influences explained 33% of the variance in the Internalizing scale and less for the other scales. The stability of the Externalizing scale over time was caused mostly by genetic factors, while nonshared environmental factors mostly caused the stability of the Internalizing scale.

AB A 1994 survey of adults from a northern Ontario city contained questions about alcohol consumption, problems experienced as a result of others' drinking, and opinions concerning solutions to such problems. The 180-question survey was administered to about 900 respondents, the vast majority of whom said they had consumed alcohol within the previous 12 months. At least one in five said they had been bothered by three types of experience caused by other drinkers: loudness, humiliation, and arguments. Young adults stood out as the group most likely to experience each type of problem caused by other drinkers. There was a robust level of support for most solutions proposed, with the exception of a city ban on drinking in indoor public places. The data suggest that comprehensive prevention efforts may be more effective than those focused on a single approach geared towards only one group or person.

AB This population-based study examines patterns of fatal motor vehicle traffic crashes (MVTCs) by age group (16-24, 25-64, 65+) among Canadian drivers. The Canadian Traffic Accident Information Databank (TRAID) provided information about fata MVTCs between 1984 and 1993. Distribution of risk factors was compared by age group. Crude odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for both young and elderly drivers compared with middle-aged drivers. The middle-age group was selected as reference population since it demonstrates the lowest risk of fatality. Compared to the middle-aged group, young drivers demonstrated excess risk for (1) risk-taking behaviours and conditions, specifically alcohol and illicit drug use, speeding, non use of seat belts, fatigue and falling asleep, and inexperience; (2) crashes during the summer, during weekends and at night; and (3) single-vehicle collisions and on performing overtaking manoeuvres. Excess risk among elderly drivers was noted for (1) medical and physical conditions, inattention and inexperience; (2) driver actions, for example, improper turning, failure to yield right-to-way; (3) occurrence on weekdays and during the day; and (4) collisions at intersection and vehicle--vehicle sideswipes. The results show notable differences in risk factors by age group and confirm the need for preventive efforts that incorporate age-specific strategies.

AB OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the effectiveness of a community education campaign to encourage a switch from high-fat (whole and 2%) milk to low-fat (1%, 1/2%, and skim) milk as a way to reduce consumption of saturated fat.; METHODS: Milk sales data were collected from supermarkets in the intervention and comparison communities for three one-month time periods: at baseline, immediately following the campaign, and six months after the campaign. In addition, trained volunteers conducted pre- and post-intervention telephone surveys.; RESULTS: Overall milk sales increased by 16% in the intervention cities following the campaign and remained high at follow-up. Low-fat milk's market share increased from 18% of overall milk sales at baseline to 41% of overall milk sales in the month following the end of the campaign, an increase in market share that was sustained at the six-month follow-up. In the post-intervention telephone survey, 38.2% of those respondents who reported drinking high-fat milk at baseline reported having switched to low-fat milk.; CONCLUSION: A focused message communicated through paid advertising, public relations activities, and community-based education programs increased low-fat and overall milk consumption in one community.

AB Behaviors related to nutrition as well as the eating habits of low-income French people are analyzed from data collected by the Nutrition and Health Barometer of the CFES in 1996. French people with monthly incomes of less than 4000 francs appear to go to fast-food restaurants more often than to other types of restaurant (for leisure or work). They appear to eat their three main meals alone more often, to spend less time over the evening meal, to watch television during their noon and evening meals, to have cheese or another dairy product rather than a main dish, and to limit their evening meal to a single dish. They are less numerous than higher-income people to have the "ideal" breakfast. These economically disavantaged French people do their shopping more often in large of medium-sized supermarkets and more often plan their meals according to the family budget. In terms of food they are more numerous to eat neither fruit nor vegetables; they consume less pork, fish and shellfish, dairy products, alcoholic beverages and especially before-dinner drinks. This study shows that the eating behavior of low-income French people is less in conformity with commonly accepted nutritional recommendations. Likewise, the rate of obesity observed among the women from this households appears high.

The questions about alcohol are asked as part of the day-long assessment.; PARTICIPANTS: Members of a longitudinal survey cohort at ages 18 and 21 years. Data from 630 beer drinking participants were analysed in this study.; MEASUREMENTS: Responses to questions about beer consumption, liking for advertising, favourite brand of beer and self-reports of alcohol-related aggressive behaviour.; FINDINGS: Our hypothesized model assumed a positive impact of liking of alcohol advertising and brand allegiance at age 18 on the volume of beer consumed at age 21 and self-reports of alcohol-related aggressive behaviour. This was found to be a good fit to the data from the longitudinal study.; CONCLUSION: This measurable impact of alcohol advertising occurred during a time of decline in aggregate alcohol in New Zealand. While this effect was not large enough to halt the decline in aggregate alcohol consumption it does indicate a measurable, specific impact of broadcast alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and related behaviour which is of relevance for public health policy.

AB As part of the evaluation of a community-level HIV prevention program for women, this study examined predictors of exposure to print media and community outreach and assessed the relationship between exposure to the intervention and condom use behavior. Data from interviews with 479 women randomly selected from the intervention community in 1995 and 1996 were examined. Analysis of demographic and risk characteristics were conducted to identify predictors of exposure to the project's HIV prevention messages. Additionally, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of intervention exposure on condom use, controlling for factors related to exposure. The results revealed that the print media campaign reached the largest number of women. However, women at highest risk did not have high rates of exposure to print media, but had greater exposure to outreach. Exposure to print media had an effect on increased communication with a main partner about condom use, but was not significantly related to condom use last time had sex. There were no significant main effects for exposure to outreach on condom use behavior. An important finding of this analysis was that each intervention strategy was successful in reaching a different portion of the target population and that exposure had differential effects on the condom use behavior of particular segments of the target population. 
A2 The five-city Prevention of HIV in Women and Infants Demonstration
   Projects (WIDP) evaluated a community-level intervention aimed at
   promoting condom use by young urban women at risk for HIV infection
   through print media and community outreach.  This article analyzes data
   from interviews with 479 women 15-34 years of age randomly selected from
   the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (US), intervention community in 1995 and
   1996.  By the time of the 1995 and 1996 surveys, 51% of women in the
   intervention community had been exposed.  Exposure to print media peaked
   in 1995 at 46% and levelled off at 44% in 1996, while exposure to
   community outreach decreased from 23% in 1995 to 14% in 1996.  Logistic
   regression analysis indicated that exposure to print media was highest
   among women currently in drug or alcohol treatment and those who
   reported binge drinking in the preceding month; exposure to outreach
   activities was greatest among women who had a sexually transmitted
   disease (STD) history and exchanged sex for money.  For women over 21
   years old who had ever had an STD and were employed, exposure to print
   media was strongly predictive of condom use at last intercourse.  Women
   who exchanged sex for money and were exposed to community outreach were
   unlikely to use condoms, but prone to discuss condoms with their main
   partner, which may be a pathway to future condom use.  Program planners
   must identify the specific population groups they want to reach and plan
   intervention strategies accordingly.  Several different strategies may
   be required to ensure messages reach those at greatest risk of HIV.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability of a scale measuring Prochaska's stages of change. Although structured questionnaire items are being increasingly used to segment target audiences according to Prochaska and DiClemente's stages of change, we could find only one report in the literature assessing the reliability of such scales. The unreliability of single-item or algorithm questionnaire scales might be why a number of studies show only minimal differences on some variables between individuals in different stages of change. A survey of the Perth metropolitan general population aged 16-69 years (N = 2629) was completed in August-September 1992 as part of a 3 year evaluation of the Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation. The consistency of respondents' responses was assessed across two questions measuring stages of change for the behaviours quitting smoking (n = 404), reducing alcohol consumption (n = 57) and doing more exercise (n = 704). Given the immediacy of the test-retest situation, the reliability results are moderately encouraging: kappa = 0.72, 0.73 and 0.52 for quitting smoking, reducing alcohol and doing more exercise, respectively. Health researchers should be aware of the probable moderate level of reliability if using the type of scale assessed in this study, when interpreting differences between individuals in different stages. In practice, several questionnaire items for classification purposes should be used so that internal reliability measures can be calculated. It is recommended that research be undertaken to devise more reliable scales for stages of change for the various health behaviours. It is noted that the attitude literature with respect to context and time specific intentions could be helpful in devising such scales.

To examine the role of positive and negative beliefs about drinking as intervening variables.; DESIGN: Survey utilizing a CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing) system, involving interviews with 1012 randomly selected respondents.; SETTING: Respondents were randomly selected from throughout New Zealand.; PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen to twenty-nine-year-old New Zealanders.; MEASUREMENTS: Response to specific alcohol advertisements was measured by recalled exposure (how often they recalled having seen the advertisements) and liking (a measure of positive response).; FINDINGS: An exploratory non-recursive structural equation model, based on 791 drinkers provided tentative support for the hypothesis that positive responses to televised beer advertisements (as measured by liking) contributed to the quantity of alcohol consumed on drinking occasions, which in turn contributed to the level of alcohol-related problems. The model, which provided a good fit to the data, was consistent with the hypothesis that liking of beer advertisements had both a direct influence on quantities of alcohol consumed and an indirect influence, via its influence on positive beliefs. These effects were present after controlling for reciprocal effects, none of which were significant. The data did not support the hypothesis that the quantities of alcohol consumed would influence the respondent's liking of beer advertisements. Recalled exposure was not a significant influence on the quantities consumed.; CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with a number of theoretical perspectives and with a growing body of research that are suggestive of alcohol advertising having some influence on the consumption of younger people.

AB Violence among youths is an important public health problem. Between 1985 and 1991, homicide rates among youths 15-19 years of age increased 154% and remain, today, at historically high levels. This paper reviews the major trends in homicide victimization and perpetration among youths over the last decade, the key risk factors associated with violence, and summarizes the many primary prevention efforts under way to reduce violence. Previous research points to a number of factors that increase the probability of violence during adolescence and young adulthood. Some of these factors include the early onset of aggressive behavior in childhood, social problem-solving skill deficits, exposure to violence, poor parenting practices and family functioning, negative peer influences, access to firearms, and neighborhoods characterized by high rates of poverty, transiency, family disruption, and social isolation. Efforts to address some of the primary risk factors for violence are under way across the United States, but evaluations to confirm program effectiveness are needed.

A2 Despite the President's directive on youth and HIV in 1997 to focus the
   nation's attention on adolescents and the battle against AIDS,
   prevention programs continue to be ineffective. The number of
   seropositive youth, ages 13 to 24 years old, is unclear due to
   inconsistent definitions of age ranges and inadequate access to testing.
   Youth have not sought testing for many reasons, including failing to
   perceive their vulnerability to HIV, confidentiality concerns, and not
   realizing the effectiveness of early treatment. Adolescents are creating
   independence, establishing relationships, and learning about drugs and
   alcohol. Young gay and bisexual men, drug-using youth, and youth of
   color are at high risk of HIV transmission. Identifying the population
   involved in risk-taking behavior and eliminating the behavior is an
   ineffective strategy for adolescent HIV prevention programs.
   Complicating the issue further, the goals and expectations of
   adolescents differ from the adults who design and deliver prevention
   programs. HIV education and prevention efforts need to address solutions
   to hopelessness, isolation, and violence, rather than focusing on the
   negative effects risky behaviors will have in the future. Effective
   programs combine a youth/adult partnership to take advantage of the
   strengths of each individual. Strategies for implementing prevention
   programs that address the specific needs of adolescents are suggested.

AB OBJECTIVE: The research in this article is designed to improve our understanding of alcohol messages embedded in prime-time television, especially when adolescent characters are shown portraying or consuming alcohol.; METHOD: Manifest and latent content analyses are used to assess the frequency of alcohol portrayal in prime-time television and the personality traits (powerful, admirable, smart) of characters shown consuming or portraying alcohol on prime-time television. The sample includes 224 hours of programming across 276 programs on four major networks.; RESULTS: Alcoholic beverages were the most frequently portrayed food or drink. The prominence of alcohol in prime-time television applies to all characters, including adolescents. The proportion of all food and drink incidents accounted for by alcohol equaled .14 for male and .20 for female adolescent television characters. Moreover, when adolescent characters are involved with alcohol incidents, they are more likely to be shown consuming this alcohol than are adults. A significant finding was that adolescents portraying alcohol in programming were shown to have significantly more negative personality characteristics than did characters in older age groups.; CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other studies, this study finds higher rates of alcohol portrayal by adolescents on prime-time television. The negative character portrayal of adolescents involved with alcohol is encouraging. However, adult and high-income characters involved with alcohol, who might serve as role models for younger adults are, on average, shown with positive personality characteristics.

AB A prospective study was undertaken at a Level I trauma center to evaluate the prevalence of substance use among victims of major trauma, along with the impact on clinical outcome. Five hundred sixteen patients had urine toxicology and blood alcohol screens performed and correlated with pattern and severity of injury, hospital course, and outcome. Three hundred seventy-one patients (71%) screened positive for alcohol or drugs, or both. Fifty-two per cent had positive alcohol screens, and 42 per cent had positive drug screens (cocaine and opiates represented 91% of positive drug screens). Univariate analysis revealed patterns of alcohol/drug use varied among subgroups according to demographics (less use among patients older than 55 years, females and Asians; more drug use in blacks; more alcohol use in Hispanics), mechanism of injury (non-use in blunt trauma patients and use of both in penetrating trauma patients) and body region injured (non-use in head-injured patients). Septic complications and mortality were more correlative with severity of injury, but not with use or non-use of alcohol or drugs. We conclude that alcohol and drug use remains a major comorbid factor in major trauma, and that injury prevention efforts should include a strong focus on counseling regarding these lifestyle choices.

Transition into injection drug use, high-risk injecting and sexual behaviors, sociodemographic differences, and the importance of social networks are discussed. Nurses are encouraged to provide health promotion, disease prevention messages, and health care to IDUs in small nontraditional clinical settings and to seek out the assistance of the IDUs' social network to increase adherence and compliance to complex prevention and therapeutic efforts.

AB In 1987, a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium O:4-12 infection traced to contaminated chocolate bars occurred in Norway. In the 5 years after the outbreak, elevated numbers of sporadic cases caused by the epidemic strain of Salmonella were detected, followed by a decline in subsequent years. To characterize the epidemiology of this infection, the authors analyzed information concerning all sporadic cases reported in Norway from 1966 to 1996. Of the 153 patients infected by the outbreak strain, 43% were less than 5 years of age, and only three persons had acquired the infection abroad. In contrast, 46% of the cases attributable to other S. typhimurium O:4-12 variants and 90% of the total number of Salmonella infections were related to foreign travel. A distinct seasonality was observed: 76% of the cases appeared between January and April. At the same time of year, the epidemic strain was regularly encountered as the etiologic agent of fatal salmonellosis among wild passerine birds, suggesting an epidemiologic link between the avian and human cases. The strain was rarely isolated from other sources. From 1990 to 1992, the authors conducted a prospective case-control study of sporadic indigenous infections to identify risk factors and obtain guidance for preventive efforts. Forty-one case-patients, each matched by age, sex, and geographic area with two population controls, were enrolled. In conditional logistic regression analysis, the following environmental factors were independently related to an increased risk of infection: drinking untreated water, having direct contact with wild birds or their droppings, and eating snow, sand, or soil. Cases were also more likely than controls to report having antecedent or concurrent medical disorders. Forty-six percent of the study patients were hospitalized for their salmonellosis.

AB The objective of this study was to report trends in alcohol problems among whites, blacks, and Hispanics between 1984 and 1995. Data were obtained from two nationwide probability samples of U.S. households, the first conducted in 1984 and the second in 1995. The 1984 sample consisted of 1777 whites, 1947 blacks, and 1453 Hispanics. The 1995 sample included 1636 whites, 1582 blacks, and 1585 Hispanics. On both occasions, interviews (average length, 1 hr) were conducted in respondents' homes by trained interviewers. The results indicate that between 1984 and 1995, alcohol problems were stable among white and black men and increased among Hispanic men. The rates of three or more alcohol problems for men of each ethnic group for 1984 and 1995 were: 12% and 11% for white men, 16% and 13% for black men, and 9% and 16% for Hispanic men, respectively. Problem prevalence was stable and relatively low among women in all three ethnic groups. Overall, the prevalence of alcohol problems continues to be high among men in the United States. Even though recent research has shown that rates of frequent heavy drinking among white men have declined, we found no corresponding decrease in problem prevalence. Rates of frequent heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems between 1984 and 1995 have remained especially high among black and Hispanic men, suggesting that men of these two ethnic groups should be specifically targeted for renewed prevention efforts.

There was no evidence for the hypothesized reciprocal effects; the frequency of drinking (including non-drinking) did not significantly affect the respondent's liking of beer advertisements. There was also no support for a hypothesis that linking of the beer advertisements was a product of a general liking for alcohol. Many of the young people themselves felt that alcohol advertising encouraged teenagers to drink. This was especially the case among 10-13-year-old males, who were the most likely to accept the portrayals in alcohol advertising as realistic.; CONCLUSIONS: Although there are limitations on the confidence with which conclusions can be drawn, the findings are consistent with qualitative and quantitative research and different theoretical perspectives on advertising processes which suggest alcohol advertising is likely to have some influence on young people.

Homicide and suicide, however, are increasing dramatically among teenagers. Family violence and the epidemic of gang activity also contribute significantly to both; violence portrayed on television, in movies, and in adolescent music also has become a more significant part of teen life. Family physicians are encouraged to implement preventive strategies for combating the problems of injury and violence in their offices, their communities, and on the broader states of medical education and public policy.

AB Geographic information systems technology was used to describe, in geographical terms, the nature and strength of the relationship in Western Australia between alcohol consumption and the rates of related injury: night-time assaults (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.); minor night-time road crashes (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.), weighted by traffic density; and hospital E-code (external-cause) morbidity, weighted by alcohol aetiologic fractions. The data were aggregated by five conventional state regions: northern, central, western, southern and Perth metropolitan. There was a general association, of equal significance for males and females, between estimated per capita alcohol consumption and the selected rates of injury in the five regions. However, the nature and strength of association between alcohol consumption and individual injury measures varied. Night-time assaults and hospital E-code morbidity were strongly, associated with consumption. Minor night-time crashes had only a weak association. The variation in the relationship between alcohol consumption and injury suggests that prevention strategies need to take into account the particular drinking patterns and associated harm that occur in different regions of the state, and to develop a range of targeted responses. High rates of consumption and injury in most country areas support the need for greater regional prevention efforts.

AB The immediate effects of a media intervention on attitudes toward alcohol were investigated with 134 secondary school pupils (aged 13 to 17 years) who completed a drinking and smoking questionnaire and expressed strength of agreement or disagreement with 13 statements about alcohol, drinking and health. Pupils then read news cuttings from popular magazines. One group read a negative message about alcohol, another group a positive message. Other groups read both positive and negative messages, and a control group had no media intervention. Immediately afterwards, all pupils responded to the same 13 statements again. Those pupils who received only a negative message became significantly more negative in their attitudes towards alcohol. Those receiving only a positive message were significantly more positive afterwards. The control group and those receiving both positive and negative messages showed little change. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for alcohol education programs at school.

AB This article reports on evidence for behaviour change in response to AIDS among women in two rural areas of Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe. It examines self-reported data on two overlapping areas of behaviour: (1) actions taken to avoid HIV-1 infection; and (2) fertility practices. The latter were used to assess the validity of the former, given that self-reported behaviour data are notoriously problematic. It is concluded that while self-reported behaviour change is exaggerated, the true level of change has nonetheless been significant and includes delayed onset of sexual relations, increased use of condoms and, possibly, increased monogamy. Reported actions taken to avoid HIV-1 infection and differentials in fertility practices were correlated with data on demographic, social and psychological factors. Differentials in fertility practices were associated with heightened risk perception--particularly when based on personal acquaintance with AIDS patients--but not with greater knowledge of HIV-1/AIDS. Results from the study suggest that effective behaviour change in Manicaland is facilitated by greater knowledge, experience and personal risk perception but obstructed by low female autonomy, marital status and economic status, and by male labour migration and alcohol consumption. Gaps in knowledge included misconceptions about the distinction between HIV-1 and AIDS, the influence of STDs, perinatal transmission, and incorrect modes of transmission. Better knowledge was associated with education, religion, travel and media exposure Personal risk perception was quite high (42%) and correlated with non-marriage, media exposure and contact with medical services. Few respondents knew close relatives with HIV/AIDS (4%) but nearly a quarter of those who felt in danger of infection said this was because friends and relatives were dying of AIDS. Many reported credible behavioural responses, some of which would only be effective given their partner's co-operation. Intensified behaviour interventions are needed which should include peer-education initiatives targeting men and individuals without access to modern media. The epidemic may accelerate fertility decline in rural Zimbabwe through behavioural as well as biological change.

This study sought to determine if adolescents who drink, or intend to drink alcohol at some future time, find image advertisements for alcohol more appealing than product advertisements. The results indicated that image advertising was preferred to product advertising, particularly by younger adolescents. Evidence of an association between preference for image advertisements and intent to drink in the future was found. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.

School-based programs were rated as significantly more effective on six prevention objectives than were television ads, testimonials by famous people, billboards, and print ads displayed on public transportation. Students perceived the two school-based programs, Project DARE (a national program conducted through local police departments) and Captain Clean (an intense live theater program coordinated with student participation), as being equally effective overall, although the interactive theater program was rated as significantly better at encouraging students to talk about their feelings concerning substance abuse issues and at relating to the students' ethnic/racial backgrounds. When students were categorized according to frequency of alcohol use, nonusers, infrequent users, and frequent users differed significantly in their ratings of the school-based programs.

AB Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that some water supply and sanitation (WSS) interventions are highly cost-effective for the control of diarrhoea among under-5-year-olds, on a par with oral rehydration therapy. These are relatively inexpensive "software-related" interventions such as hygiene education, social marketing of good hygiene practices, regulation of drinking-water, and monitoring of water quality. Such interventions are needed to ensure that the potentially positive health impacts of WSS infrastructure are fully realized in practice. The perception that WSS programmes are not a cost-effective use of health sector resources has arisen from three factors: an assumption that all WSS interventions involve construction of physical infrastructure, a misperception of the health sector's role in WSS programmes, and a misunderstanding of the scope of cost-effectiveness analysis. WSS infrastructure ("hardware") is generally built and operated by public works agencies and financed by construction grants, operational subsidies, user fees and property taxes. Health sector agencies should provide "software" such as project design, hygiene education, and water quality regulation. Cost-effectiveness analysis should measure the incremental health impacts attributable to health sector investments, using the actual call on health sector resources as the measure of cost. The cost-effectiveness of a set of hardware and software combinations is estimated, using US$ per case averted, US$ per death averted, and US$ per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) saved.

PY 1998

AB This review discusses efforts to develop rodent models for the study of neurobiological mechanisms underlying chronic alcohol drinking, alcoholism, and abnormal alcohol-seeking behavior. Selective breeding has produced stable lines of rats that reliably exhibit high and (for comparison purposes) low voluntary alcohol consumption. In addition, animal models of chronic ethanol self-administration have been developed in rodents, who do not have a genetic predisposition for high alcohol-seeking behavior, to explore environmental influences in ethanol drinking and the effects of physical dependence on alcohol self-administration. The selectively bred high-preference animals reliably self-administer ethanol by free-choice drinking and operantly respond for oral ethanol in amounts that produce pharmacologically meaningful blood alcohol concentrations (50 to 200 mg% and higher). In addition, the alcohol-preferring rats will self-administer ethanol by intragastric infusion. With chronic free-choice drinking, the high alcohol-preferring rats develop tolerance to the high-dose effects of ethanol and show signs of physical dependence after the withdrawal of alcohol. Compared with nonpreferring animals, the alcohol-preferring rats are less sensitive to the sedative-hypnotic effects of ethanol and develop tolerance more quickly to high-dose ethanol. Nonselected common stock rats can be trained to chronically self-administer ethanol following its initial presentation in a palatable sucrose or saccharin solution, and the gradual replacement of the sucrose or saccharin with ethanol (the sucrose/saccharin-fade technique). Moreover, rats that are trained in this manner and then made dependent by ethanol-vapor inhalation or liquid diet increase their ethanol self-administration during the withdrawal period. Both the selectively bred rats and common-stock rats demonstrate "relapse" and an alcohol deprivation effect following 2 or more weeks of abstinence. Systemic administration of agents that (1) increase synaptic levels of serotonin (5-HT) or dopamine (DA); (2) activate 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, D2, D3, or GABA(A) receptors; or (3) block opioid and 5-HT3 receptors decrease ethanol intake in most animal models. Neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and neuropharmacological studies indicate innate differences exist between the high alcohol-consuming and low alcohol-consuming rodents in various CNS limbic structures. In addition, reduced mesolimbic DA and 5-HT function have been observed during alcohol withdrawal in common stock rats. Depending on the animal model under study, abnormalities in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, and/or the serotonin, opioid, and GABA systems that regulate this pathway may underlie vulnerability to the abnormal alcohol-seeking behavior in the genetic animal models.

AB African-American women are heavier than European-American women; the reasons are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine potentially modifiable reasons for the weight difference among 86,326 female nurses. The determinants of body mass index (BMI) were modelled using the method of linear regression. The findings included the following: mean BMI (kg/m2) was 9.0% (95% CI, 7.8-10.1%) higher among African American (27.3) than among European-American women (25.1) (P<0.0001). However, recalled BMI at age 18 was equal in the two groups (21.4, P=0.98). Multivariate determinants of BMI include age, age 18 BMI, alcohol and calorie intake, exercise, marital status, parity, race, recent intentional weight loss, smoking, and television watching. Even after controlling for these factors, African-American women still had an 8.6% (95% CI, 7.7-9.5%) higher BMI than European-American women. Correction for error in measurement of physical activity attenuated this difference to 6.4% (95% CI, 5.0-7.8%). In conclusion, in this single occupation group, African-American women had a significantly higher BMI than European-American women. Age and measured behavioral factors did not explain this difference. However, imprecision in the measurement of diet and activity may explain this difference in part. Better measurement may help quantify the differences that are as yet unexplained.

AB Altered motor vehicle drivers's licenses or other falsified or counterfeit photo identification cards are widely and illegally used by teenagers to obtain beer and other alcohol beverages. We obtained information on the methods currently used by teenagers to purchase beer and wine by asking nine hundred teenagers, between 16-19 years old to complete a brief, confidential questionnaire. High school students most often obtained alcoholic beverages by requesting someone of legal age to purchase it for them. College students used borrowed, altered, or counterfeit identification (ID) more often than high school students. Photo IDs purchased through mail order from a magazine advertisement were used infrequently and when use was attempted, they were sometimes (25%) unsuccessful. Fifteen percent of high school students, 14% of college freshmen, and 24% of teenage drug abusers were able to purchase beer by the case with borrowed, altered, or fake ID. Suggestions to reduce sales of alcohol-containing beverages to minors include universal "carding" of prospective purchasers, use of two view or hologram photos on a drivers' license, requiring three different ID cards at the point of purchase, and penalties to stores that fail to make a good effort to identify underage customers.

AB This paper examines targeted alcohol advertising in three ethnic communities: African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans in the U.S. We focus on the appropriation of cultural systems and the reinvention of them as commodities to consumers. We outline the specific strategies used in each ethnic community. For African Americans, there is an emphasis on selling malt liquor to young adults through the use of "power" and gang-related images. For Latinos, there is an appropriation of historical and cultural symbols such as the national flags and maps of Mexico and Central America. Native Americans have coalesced to keep the image of a chief and warrior, Crazy Horse, from being used to market malt liquor. Each of the ethnic groups is engaged in action to prevent alcohol-related problems in their communities. Generating and implementing solutions is a universal social responsibility.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between early onset drug use and the development of lifetime DSM-IV drug abuse and dependence using a representative sample of the U.S. population. Prevalences of lifetime drug abuse and dependence were estimated for each year of age of onset of drug use from ages 13 and younger to 21 and older for the overall sample of drug users by race and gender. Linear logistic analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between age of drug use onset and lifetime drug use disorders controlling for important covariates. The major finding of this study was that early onset drug use is a significant predictor of the subsequent development of drug abuse over the life course. Early onset drug use was also a significant predictor of the subsequent development of lifetime alcohol dependence among males, females, and nonblacks, but not among blacks. After adjusting for important model covariates, the likelihood of lifetime drug abuse and dependence among the total sample of lifetime drug users was reduced by 4% and 5% with each year drug use onset was delayed. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the importance of collecting national data on drug use, abuse and dependence and the need for further research and its integration with prevention efforts.

AB The present study examined the relationship between acculturation, alcohol consumption and AIDS-related risky sexual behavior in a national probability sample of 533 African American women. Results indicated that women who were the heaviest drinkers were also the least acculturated. However, women most likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, including having multiple partners, being nonmonogamous or in a nonmonogamous relationship, and being nonmonogamous or in a nonmonogamous relationship and not using a condom consistently, were high in acculturation rather than low. Alcohol use proved related to risky sexual behavior when considered in conjunction with respondents' level of acculturation. Women at risk for contracting AIDS were not low acculturated African American women who drank heavily, but high acculturated African American women. Findings from this study extend our understanding of risk and contain implications for research and prevention efforts in the area of alcohol use and AIDS-related sexual behavior among African American women. 
A2 The relationship between acculturation, alcohol consumption, and
   AIDS-related risky sexual practices was investigated in a national
   probability sample of 533 African American women.  Data were collected
   in 1991-92 as part of a follow-up survey to the 1984 US National Alcohol
   Survey.  Acculturation--the extent of adaptation to US mainstream
   society--was measured through use of a 10-item questionnaire related to
   preference for African American mass media and reliance on an African
   American social network.  Scores on this scale ranged from 1.00 (low
   acculturation) to 3.78 (high acculturation).  Most respondents were
   18-29 years of age and lived in urban areas.  Among the 306 respondents
   (74%) who were sexually active in the preceding year, 60 (21%) had had
   multiple sex partners, 130 (43%) were in a nonmonogamous relationship,
   and 266 (91%) had not used condoms consistently.  109 women (41%)
   abstained from alcohol consumption, 107 (36%) were moderate drinkers,
   and 90 (22%) consumed 5 or more drinks per day.  When sociodemographic
   factors, religiosity, and attitudes toward sex were controlled, it was
   found that high-risk sexual practices were most prevalent among
   respondents with high levels of both acculturation and alcohol
   consumption.  Heavy drinking alone was not a risk factor.  Multivariate
   analysis indicated that women in the high acculturation/heavy drinking
   group were 13 times more likely to have multiple sex partners than their
   low acculturation/alcohol abstinent counterparts.  These findings
   suggest the need for AIDS prevention programs for African American women
   that address alcohol treatment and assertiveness training.

AB BACKGROUND: Daytime sleepiness is widespread and has negative impacts on the public sector.; OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the incidence and prevalence of daytime sleepiness and associated risk factors in the general population.; METHOD: In 1994, a representative sample of the non-institutionalized British population aged 15 years or older was interviewed via telephone using an expert computer-assisted program designed to facilitate surveys of this type (Sleep-Eval, M. M. Ohayon, Montreal, Quebec). Subjects were classified into 3 groups based on the severity of their daytime sleepiness. We completed 4972 interviews (acceptance rate, 79.6%).; RESULTS: Severe daytime sleepiness was reported in 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 4.9%-6.1%) of the sample, and moderate daytime sleepiness in another 15.2% (95% confidence interval, 14.2%-16.2%). Associated factors with severe daytime sleepiness included female sex, middle age, napping, insomnia symptoms, high daily caffeine consumption, breathing pauses or leg pain in sleep, depressive disorder (based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria), falling asleep while reading or watching television, and motor vehicle crashes or accidents involving use of machinery. Moderate daytime sleepiness was associated with female sex, napping, insomnia symptoms, arthritis or heart disease, and gross motor movements during sleep.; CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that daytime sleepiness deleteriously affects work activities, social and/or marital life, and exhibits a negative socioeconomic impact. In addition, the risk of a motor vehicle crash appears to be higher in this specific population: twice as many subjects operating a motor vehicle or using machine tools reported having a crash or accident, respectively, in the previous year in the groups with severe daytime sleepiness or moderate daytime sleepiness than did the general population with no daytime sleepiness. The high prevalence rates of daytime sleepiness and multiplicity of related factors mandate further scrutiny by public health officials.

AB Alcohol is involved in a substantial percentage of injuries, with estimates in the United States ranging from 3% of drownings up to 50% of fatal traffic crashes. Thus, alcohol-involved injury is a natural target for prevention efforts, particularly at the community level. Although a potentially valuable target, the measurement of alcohol-involved injuries for purposes of outcome evaluation of such prevention is problematic. The consistent measurement of alcohol in the blood of injured persons is not a regular aspect of acute medical treatment. Thus, alternatives are needed both for epidemiological, as well as prevention, research. This study will review three alternative measurements of alcohol-involved injury [i.e., (a) emergency room interviews and breath testing for blood alcohol concentration, (b) telephone surveys of self-reported injuries after drinking, and (c) injury surrogate derived archival data from hospital inpatient treatment]. After comparing the strengths and weaknesses of all three and investigating the sensitivity of the injury surrogate to detect changes in alcohol-involved injuries, this study concludes that the injury surrogate is a reliable, low-cost, and valid outcome measure for prevention evaluation.

A2 Young people in Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States have
   either witnessed, participated in, or been victims of abrupt changes
   which led to the collapse of the value systems by which they and their
   parents had learned to live.  Their parents' position in society
   changed, with many struggling to support their families in conditions of
   widespread resource scarcity, including shortages of food, electricity,
   heating, and water supplies.  Increased family tension has driven many
   parents to drink more alcohol, thereby increasing the risk of violence
   in the family.  Almost everywhere in the region, young people expressed
   their desire to be better informed about reproductive health issues.  A
   survey found that the overwhelming majority of more than 700 sampled
   youths had learned what they knew about reproductive health from
   friends, television, newspapers, and magazines.  In Romania, lack of
   proper education and social discrimination mean that many people
   infected with STDs seek medical care only when their diseases have
   reached an advanced stage, while studies in Bulgaria show a declining
   mean age at first intercourse and a low level of condom use.  In Turkey,
   an IEC (information, education, and communication) project was launched
   in 26 cities and towns to improve and extend family planning services. 
   Elsewhere, the Orthodox Church in the Russian Federation has called
   abortion murder, young people can get good quality counseling in a range
   of institutions in Estonia, and abortion has become the main means of
   birth control in Ukraine.

AB This study tested a social learning model and explored the direct and interactive relationships between personality and environment in predicting problem alcohol use. We used longitudinal data from a nonclinical sample of males and females first tested in adolescence and followed into young adulthood. Hierarchial regression analyses were used to test main effects and interaction models. The cross-sectional data supported an interactive social learning model. Both personality and environment variables significantly predicted problem drinking. Two interactions between heavy drinking peer groups and personality variables were significant. Contrary to our hypothesis, the direction of the interaction was negative. In contrast, the longitudinal analyses did not provide strong support for our interactive model. Personality variables were significant predictors longitudinally, but in only one analysis did an environment variable significantly predict problem drinking. Furthermore, none of the interactions was significant predictors over time. Overall, the findings suggest that social learning models based on the interaction of personality and environmental influences may be more appropriate for predicting concurrent, as opposed to future problems, and that future research should include person-environment interactions. In addition, cultural tolerance of heavy drinking may be an important determinant of the role of psychological vulnerability in the development of problem drinking.

AB This article describes the epidemiologic profile of Puerto Rican women affected by AIDS in the San Juan Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). Information from AIDS cases reported to the Puerto Rico (PR) AIDS Surveillance System was analyzed. From July 1981 through June 30 1995, a cumulative total of 15,877 AIDS cases have been reported in PR, 9,838 (62%) of these cases were reported in the San Juan SMSA and 2,044 (20.8%) were women. The male to female ratio was 3.8. The predominant mode of exposure among women was heterosexual contact (48.7%), followed by intravenous drug use (40.4%). The most affected age group among women was 30 to 39 years (43.3%) followed by 20-29 (26.2%). Eighty-one percent of women were in childbearing age. A substantial increase in AIDS cases has been reported for women who revealed heterosexual contact (from 45% in 1993 to 64% in 1995), representing the fastest growing category of AIDS cases in the island. The median survival time after reporting was 16.4 months (95% CI: 15.3-17.7) for males and 22.7 months (95% CI: 19.9 and 26.9) for females. Preventive efforts must be oriented toward education and risk behavior modification primarily directed to young women.

AB This study aims to investigate smoking patterns in high school student and to give student smoker effective information. The sample of 250 male high school students out of two different schools in Tae-Jon was questioned from July 10th to 15th, 1995. In analyzing these date, the statistics shows the realities by means of number of students. The results are summarized into 17 items as follows. Regarding the level of smoking, 140 students out of 250 admit that they have ever smoked, 52.1% of smoking students say that the motivation of beginning smoking is mainly curiosity. The survey shows that 22.9% of smoking students feel very good when smoking. It also shows that 30.0% of smoking students began smoking in the first grade of high school. With regard to the volume of smoking per day, 41.4% of smoking students smoke variably, 42.1% drink when smoking, 15.0% spend more than W 70,000 a month. About the question who knows the fact of their smoking, 51.5% answer that their friends know the fact of their smoking. In regard to the reslationship between smoking and school performance, 18.2% of non smoking students make poor grades as compared with 40% of smoking students, 9.3% of smoking students say that they are satisfied with the school life, but 35.7% of them are not satisfied. Regarding the attitude to smoking teachers, 35% of smoking students state that they are affected by them. 69.3% of smoking students say that they will stop smoking, while the remaining 30.7% say that they will keep smoking. The reason of 63.9% to stop smoking is that smoking is bad for the health. The reason of 46.5% to keep smoking is the acquired habit of smoking. 97.2% know the fact that the major element of cigarettes is nicotine and it is very harmful to the health. 40.8% recognize the harmful effect of smoking by TV and radio programs. 97.2% know that smoking could cause lung cancer. From the above results. I propose as follows We should make specific plan to keep smoking by simple curiosity from being developed into habitual smoking. We should teach them how harmful smoking is and make them stop smoking by themselves. It is very essential for family members and teachers to give continuous interest since childhood. As the teacher affect the students very much, they should give up smoking first. The incidence of smoking should be identified in each of the middle and high schools, smoking prohibition programs relevant to each school should be developed and implemented. The local community should ban cigarette vending machines. Cigarettes should not be sold to adolescents. By setting every place where adolescents gather including schools non-smoking area, we should decrease their impulse to smoke, then smoking opportunities, and harmful effects to them caused by passive smoking.

AB Alcohol is the most frequently used psycho-active substance during adolescence. Adolescents who misuse or overindulge in alcohol are at risk for serious social and psychological consequences. Several preventive approaches can help adolescents deal with peer pressure that contributes to alcohol use experimentation and escalation. One promising approach involves teaching adolescents skills to refuse offers of alcohol and other drugs. Few studies, however, have examined how this approach works; that is, the connection between the prevention effort, refusal skills, and drinking behavior. This paper investigates the relationships among the intervention, refusal skills, and alcohol misuse in the Alcohol Misuse Prevention Study, a randomized, pre/post experimental study. Based on data from sixth through tenth graders (average N per grade = approximately 400), regression analyses indicate that refusal skills are significant mediators of the effect of the intervention on alcohol misuse.

AB Although gender differences in the consumption and abuse of alcohol and drugs are frequently reported, the etiology of these differences has received limited attention. The present study applied biometric genetic analyses to determine whether self-report questionnaire items assessing problem alcohol and drug use are influenced by gender-specific genetic and environmental influences. The sample consisted of 693 volunteer general population twin pairs (209 monozygotic female, 138 monozygotic male, 170 dizygotic female, 82 dizygotic male, 94 dizygotic opposite-sex twin pairs). Heritability analyses showed that most aspects of drug and alcohol problems were differentially heritable by gender. Significant additive genetic effects were found only in males, whereas in females, most substance use problems were wholly determined by environmental factors. In both genders, non-shared environmental factors accounted for the largest proportion of the variance, and further gender-by-genotype analyses showed that these influences were not gender specific, but rather were common to males and females. Some preliminary evidence was also obtained that the use of illicit drugs may be etiologically distinct from the use of licit drugs in females and males.

High mortality rates for all causes, ranging between 20.5/1000 person-years in Rome and 11.0/1000 in Naples, were observed especially in the last two years of the follow-up except in Naples where the mortality reached a maximum in 1983-84. The major causes of death were overdose, AIDS and violence but with some differences among centres. In all cities, the observed mortality among drug injectors was greater than that of the general population; SMRs for all causes were 15.1 (CL = 13.9-16.4) in Turin, 15.6 (CL = 14.4-16.8) in Rome, 8.2 (CL = 7.1-9.5) in Naples and 11.9 (LC = 10.2-13.7) in Cagliari. Different selection criteria for entering treatment throughout centres, and the heterogeneity of the therapeutic programmes offered can be considered to explain the differences of mortality observed among drug users. With regard to the heterogeneity in overdose mortality, the geographical and temporal variations in illegal drugs market should be taken into account. Further investigations are needed to verify these hypotheses.

AB Research on substance abuse prevention programs indicates that effectiveness is greater when multiple intervention approaches that address the specific vocabulary, perceptions, and values of the target population are employed. The field of health communication provides unique perspectives on media that can be applied to increase the salience and effectiveness of substance abuse prevention programs. Well-designed and well-delivered health communications have the capacity for reaching remote audiences, changing health attitudes and behavior, shaping social norms, changing the way health issues are portrayed by the popular media, and influencing decisions about legislation and policies. Health communication approaches are generally employed within the broad context of health promotion programs, along with education, community development, empowerment, and social change approaches. This article describes the role of health communication in substance abuse prevention, reviews major conceptualizations of health communication, and introduces the unique features of the four articles included in this special section of Health Education & Behavior.

AB A substance abuse prevention and life skills program for economically disadvantaged, high sensation seeking African American teens was developed and tested in Cincinnati, Ohio. Formative research was conducted to determine program content and format. Over two implementations, 289 individuals in the target population were recruited as participants for the field test of the program. For the first implementation, participants were randomly selected from the city's summer youth employment program. For the second, a media campaign was designed to recruit participants. Process evaluation indicated that participants evaluated the program extremely positively. Outcome evaluation indicated that significant pretest differences between high and low sensation seekers were neutralized for liquor and marijuana in both years of the program and for attitude toward drugs in the first year of the program. These results suggest that sensation seeking is a useful message design and audience-targeting variable for substance abuse prevention program design. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.

Focus groups with the target audiences determined the novelas' concentration on alcohol, their medium and language of choice for Hispanic youth versus parents, and the health messages and cultural values to be portrayed. Reactions to the novelas were obtained via self-report surveys, random street interviews, radio listener call-ins, and community group meetings. Favorable reactions were obtained regarding the novelas' cultural sensitivity and appropriateness, and their potential to affect future behavior change. The affect of the television novela on Hispanic youth was evaluated by a pre-post self-report survey administered to middle and high school students. Survey results indicated the television novela may have had some positive impact on Hispanic youth attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding alcohol. The evaluation time line was limiting, however, and further evaluation is required.

AB This paper presents new knowledge on risk factors involving violent victimization. The data stem from a representative survey of youths living in the Oslo area (n 447, response rate 86%). Questions on victimization experiences, drinking habits, alcohol problems, violence towards others and conflict-provoking behavior were first asked between the ages of 18 and 20 years (1993), and were repeated in the follow-up two years later. More men than women had been victimized. In both sexes there was a significant connection between alcohol problems and experiences as a victim. However, the consumption of alcohol and frequency of intoxication were only slightly related to such experiences. In men, both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses showed that violence towards others had a much greater statistical effect than any of the variables relating to drinking behavior. In fact, the effect was greater than that of any other variable in the study. In women, previous victimization was, without doubt, the most significant predictor for future victimization. Stability over time of such experiences was also much higher for women than for men. As regards preventive efforts targeted towards victimization among youths, our findings suggest that a specific programme for each of the sexes needs to be developed and implemented.

AB OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the magnitude and trends of the HIV epidemic associated with injecting drug use in Europe.; METHODS: AIDS cases associated with injecting drug users (IDU) diagnosed through 1995 were analysed, including IDU, homo-/bisexual IDU, heterosexual partners of IDU and children whose mothers were IDU. HIV seroprevalence studies among IDU were reviewed.; RESULTS: Of the 171,932 cumulative AIDS cases, 73,119 (43%) were IDU-associated (IDU, 89.0%; homo-/bisexual IDU, 3.5%: heterosexual partners of IDU, 6.2%; children with IDU mothers, 1.4%). Over 90% of IDU-associated cases were concentrated in south-western European countries with considerably higher rates in Spain (124 cases per million in 1995) than elsewhere (Italy, 68 per million; Portugal, 42 per million; France, 38 per million). During 1990-1995, incidence increased at an average annual rate of 11% overall and > 23% in central and eastern Europe; overall, incidence increased in older persons (12%) while decreasing in those aged 13-24 years (by 6%). HIV prevalence in IDU showed considerable geographic variation across and within countries. In several countries of western Europe, prevalence decreased. In the former Soviet Union, large HIV outbreaks have recently been detected among IDU through systematic HIV testing (e.g., in Ukraine, 6750 HIV infections were diagnosed in IDU tested during 1995-1996).; CONCLUSIONS: IDU have played a major role in the spread of HIV in Europe. In several western European countries, the incidence of HIV acquired through drug use has declined following high rates in mid-1980s. Studies to assess current transmission are needed and prevention efforts must be maintained. In eastern Europe, emerging epidemics reinforce the urgency for prevention.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of HIV in Ho Chi Minh City in the context of current surveillance data from Vietnam.; METHODS: Since the late 1980s, HIV surveillance data have been collected in Ho Chi Minh City from centers for the treatment of venereal disease and tuberculosis, centers for the rehabilitation of injecting drug users and sex workers, prenatal clinics, blood banks and other sites.; RESULTS: The first case of HIV infection in Vietnam was identified in 1990 in Ho Chi Minh City. The cumulative number of reported HIV infections in this city at the end of 1996 was 2774, about half of the number of cases in the country; 86% of infections were among men, 86% among injecting drug users, 2.5% among patients with sexually transmitted diseases and 2.5% among sex workers. The first HIV infection among antenatal women was detected in 1994. The prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users rose dramatically from 1% in 1992 to 39% in 1996, compared with 1.2% among sex workers, 0.3% among blood donors and 1.3% among tuberculosis patients in 1996. The populations of injecting drug users and sex workers in Ho Chi Minh City are estimated to be 30000 and 80000, respectively, and rates of sexually transmitted diseases are 2-3 per 1000 persons per year. By the end of December 1996, 42 out of 53 provinces had reported HIV infections, and border areas near China and Cambodia began identifying large numbers of HIV-seropositive people.; CONCLUSIONS: Ho Chi Minh City is at the forefront of a new HIV epidemic in Vietnam. This epidemic shows similarities to that in Thailand nearly a decade ago, with rapidly rising HIV rates among injecting drug users and infection already established among sex workers. Prevention efforts should include the targeting of injecting drug users and sex workers outside rehabilitation centers, the availability of sterile needles and condoms, the establishment of anonymous testing sites, the control of sexually transmitted diseases and the coordination of programs within southeast Asia. 
A2 An analysis of annual sentinel surveillance data from Viet Nam indicates
   that Ho Chi Minh City is at the forefront of a new HIV epidemic.  Since
   1990, data on HIV cases have been collected from prenatal clinics, blood
   banks, centers for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
   and tuberculosis, and rehabilitation centers for injecting drug users
   and commercial sex workers.  The first HIV case in Viet Nam was reported
   in 1990 in Ho Chi Minh City.  By the end of 1996, a cumulative total of
   4961 HIV cases had been documented in Viet Nam, 2774 of which were in Ho
   Chi Minh City.  In Ho Chi Minh City, 86.5% of cumulative HIV infections
   involved men.  The distribution of total HIV cases by group has been:
   injecting drug users, 86.0%; tuberculosis patients, 3.3%; sex workers,
   2.5%; STD patients, 2.5%; and pregnant women, 0.6%.  By 1996, 42 of Viet
   Nam's 53 provinces had reported HIV cases and infection rates are rising
   dramatically in border areas near China and Cambodia.  The pattern
   documented in this analysis resembles that observed in Thailand a decade
   ago: rapidly rising HIV rates among injecting drug users and infection
   already established among sex workers, without dissemination to the
   general population.  The necessary infrastructure and resources for
   control of the epidemic are far more limited in Viet Nam than Thailand,
   however.  Recommended, to prevent the further spread of HIV in Viet Nam,
   are educational activities targeted at injecting drug users and sex
   workers outside of rehabilitation centers, the availability of condoms
   and sterile needles, establishment of anonymous testing sites, control
   of STDs, and the coordination of programs within southeast Asia.

AB In 1995, a statewide survey of alcohol and other drug use was conducted in a random sample of approximately 4,000 7th to 12th graders in public schools in Connecticut. The survey, part of a statewide substance abuse treatment needs assessment, showed that use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana was widespread and increasing, particularly among younger students. Connecticut's students reported higher rates of substance use compared to their peers nationwide. Substance use differed according to age, gender, ethnic background, and community type. It was estimated that almost 1-in-10 senior high school students should receive a diagnostic evaluation for substance abuse, with half likely to need a treatment referral. Most of these adolescents had not received treatment for their substance abuse. Primary-care physicians can play a key role in reducing adolescent substance abuse through prevention messages, screening for drug use, brief interventions, and timely referrals to appropriate intervention services.

Among Christian, Druze and Moslem males there were 81.72, 49.61% and 31.93%, respectively, who drank. The figures for females were 36.75%, 11.25% and 12.78%. About 4 % of Moslem males drank 5 drinks or more consecutively, daily or every 2-3 days. The need for preventive efforts in the Arab sector is stressed.

AB Three comparable representative samples of 7th to 12th grade students in New York State were surveyed in 1983, 1990, and 1994 to determine changes in the patterns of alcohol use over the past decade. Each of the three samples was large (n = 27,335, 23,860, and 19,321, respectively), permitting detailed analysis of changes in alcohol use in various adolescent subgroups according to age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Previous research revealed that there were marked decreases in the prevalence of overall drinking, heavy drinking, and alcohol-related problems from 1983 to 1990, yet recent national reports indicate that since 1990 there has been an upsurge in substance use among adolescents. Whereas the proportion of drinkers did not significantly increase between 1990 and 1994, average consumption, heavy drinking, and alcohol-related problems all showed modest, but significant increases in the 1990s. Furthermore, between 1990 and 1994, the age distributions for alcohol use, heavy drinking, and alcohol problems changed, as evidenced by significant age by year of survey interactions. These findings indicate that adolescents are currently drinking, drinking heavily, and experiencing alcohol-related problems at younger ages that they were in past years. Prevention efforts should be targeted at delaying alcohol use in early adolescence.

AB Of 22,274 patients > or = 12 years old attending a Nairobi primary health care (PHC) clinic, 1076 (4.8%) had STD-related complaints, of whom 980 underwent assessment of risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and infrequent condom use. Gonorrhoea, chancroid, syphilis seroactivity, trichomoniasis, or objective signs of STD were found in 78%, and HIV seropositivity in 15% of men and 19% of women. Most women were married, living with a spouse; while most men were single, or married, but living separated from a spouse. Among married men, last sex was with a female sex worker (FSW) or casual partner for 60% not living with a spouse and 26% living with a spouse (P<0.005). Two or more partners during the past year were reported by 82% of men and 25% of women (P <0.001), and 55% of men and 11% of women reported the last partner was high risk. HIV seropositivity among both genders was associated with numbers of partners, and among women, with being widowed or divorced. Only 3% reported use of a condom with the last partner. Among men whose last sex was with a FSW, 74% said the reason for not using a condom was not having one. Thus, infrequent condom use, low condom availability, and gender differences in behaviour necessitate modifying development policies that separate families; and better coordination between family planning, PHC, and AIDS/STD programmes, with improved supply, social marketing and community-based distribution of condoms in high-risk settings for STD/HIV prevention.

AB PURPOSE: The influence of genetic factors on characteristics of smooth pursuit were evaluated in young adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins before and after the administration of a single dose of ethanol.; METHODS: Sinusoidal pursuit was recorded using a scleral search coil at frequencies of 0.25 and 0.5 Hz before and after alcohol consumption. Pursuit gain, interval between saccades, saccadic accuracy, and saccadic amplitude were quantified.; RESULTS: Alcohol consumption reduced pursuit gain and saccadic accuracy and increased the rate and amplitude of saccades. Before and after alcohol consumption, the intraclass correlations for MZ twins (rMZ) were highly significant for pursuit gain, interval between saccades, and saccade amplitude. Corresponding correlations for DZ twins (rDZ) were not significant. Heritability values were similar before and after alcohol ingestion.; CONCLUSIONS: The disparity between rMZ and rDZ suggests either multiple gene interactions or common environmental influences for MZ twins, greater than those for DZ twins.

AB OBJECTIVES: Music videos from five genres of music were analyzed for portrayals of tobacco and alcohol use and for portrayals of such behaviors in conjunction with sexuality.; METHODS: Music videos (n = 518) were recorded during randomly selected days and times from four television networks. Four female and four male observers aged 17 to 24 years were trained to use a standardized content analysis instrument. All videos were observed by rotating two-person, male-female teams who were required to reach agreement on each behavior that was scored. Music genre and network differences in behaviors were analyzed with chi-squared tests.; RESULTS: A higher percentage (25.7%) of MTV videos than other network videos portrayed tobacco use. The percentage of videos showing alcohol use was similar on all four networks. In videos that portrayed tobacco and alcohol use, the lead performer was most often the one smoking or drinking and the use of alcohol was associated with a high degree of sexuality on all the videos.; CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that even modest levels of viewing may result in substantial exposure to glamorized depictions of alcohol and tobacco use and alcohol use coupled with sexuality.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to know the attitude towards alcohol and its consumption among schoolchildren. We also studied the influence of the immediate environment.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were a random sample of sixth and eight grade schoolchildren during the 1995 school year from our rural area (n = 14,537). Data were collected from a confidential and anonymous survey about attitude and alcohol consumption.; RESULTS: We found that 63% of children had tried alcohol occasionally. Forty-seven percent of them drank on a regular basis. Furthermore, 8% of this group consumed beer daily. Among frequent drinkers, 20.4% had gotten drunk at some time and this was more frequent among boys (p < 0.01) and older students. Forty percent of children did not think alcohol was a drug. Regarding family environment, 37% of fathers consumed alcohol daily in contrast to 4% of mothers. Logistic-regression analyses showed an independent association between alcohol consumption and smoking habits.; CONCLUSIONS: A great number of schoolchildren and consumed alcohol occasionally. Boys and older students had gotten drunk more frequently than girls. Moreover, they believe that alcohol is not a drug and cannot perceive it as a harmful substance.

AB We hypothesized that fluoride partly acts by changing the levels of circulating calcium-regulating hormones and skeletal growth factors. The effects of oral fluoride on 24 female, Dutch-Belted, young adult rabbits were studied. The rabbits were divided into two study groups, one control and the other receiving about 16 mg fluoride/rabbit/day in their drinking water. After 6 months of fluoride dosing, all rabbits were euthanized and bone and blood samples were taken for analyses. Fluoride treatment increased serum and bone fluoride levels by over an order of magnitude (P < 0.001), but did not affect body weight or the following serum biochemical variables: urea, creatinine, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, SGOT, or total alkaline phosphatase. No skeletal fluorosis or osteomalacia was observed histologically, nor did fluoride affect serum PTH or Vitamin D metabolites (P > 0.4). BAP was increased 37% (P < 0.05) by fluoride; serum TRAP was increased 42% (P < 0.05); serum IGF-1 was increased 40% (P < 0.05). Fluoride increased the vertebral BV/TV by 35% (P < 0.05) and tibial ash weight by 10% (P < 0.05). However, the increases in bone mass and bone formation were not reflected in improved bone strength. Fluoride decreased bone strength by about 19% in the L5 vertebra (P < 0.01) and 25% in the femoral neck (P < 0. 05). X-ray diffraction showed altered mineral crystal thickness in fluoride-treated bones (P < 0.001), and there was a negative association between crystal width and fracture stress of the femur (P < 0.02). In conclusion, fluoride's effects on bone mass and bone turnover were not mediated by PTH. IGF-1 was increased by fluoride and was associated with increased bone turnover, but was not correlated with bone formation markers. High-dose fluoride treatment did not improve, but decreased, bone strength in rabbits, even in the absence of impaired mineralization.

AB Smoking prevention during childhood and adolescence is critical to the successful reduction of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. The research literature is replete with surveys describing youth smoking acquisition and related factors. In addition to its direct harm, tobacco use may be a gateway to other substance abuse and a marker of other health-compromising behaviors. The pediatrician can play an important role in prevention by screening all patients and providing individual counseling. The pediatrician can also contribute as a consultant and advocate of school- and community-based smoking prevention efforts. Such a multicomponent approach provides the greatest likelihood of accelerating the decline in smoking and smokeless tobacco initiation.

AB AIM: To use the available literature to identify the causes of suicide among indigenous adolescents.; METHOD: The PRECEDE model provided a framework to organize the material and identify the areas where relatively little research had been reported.; RESULTS: The epidemiological diagnosis showed that suicide was greater in indigenous than non-indigenous populations and particularly high among adolescent males. Environments of native persons are characterized by remoteness, poverty, cultural displacement, and family disintegration. The educational and organizational diagnosis identified predisposing factors reflecting the social environments previously identified, the enabling factors of televised suicides, and firearm and alcohol availability, in conjunction with an absence of positive expectations. Finally the administrative and policy diagnosis identified a piecemeal, short term perspective, often lacking cultural sensitivity. Although there was more literature from the United States than from Canada, Australia or New Zealand, the pictures emerging were consistent, with problems being identified across continents. Literature was more abundant in relation to the epidemiological, environmental, and educational/ organizational diagnoses than in relation to policy and administration.; CONCLUSION: The increased suicide rates among indigenous adolescents were not a product of their native origins, but of the social milieu in which these people generally found themselves.

   India, in 1994 compared awareness of AIDS.  84.48% of urban and 90.39%
   of rural students agreed that the sex education they received in school
   was inadequate.  AIDS was identified as an infectious disease by 67.24%
   of urban and 63.36% of rural students.  Modes of HIV transmission
   identified by urban and rural girls, respectively, included: use of
   unsterilized needles for injection (81.03% and 25.0%), drinking from the
   same glass as an infected person (6.89% and 17.3%), sex with an infected
   person (81.03% and 59.62%), and mosquito bites (8.62% and 7.69%). 
   12.07% of urban students and 55.77% of their rural counterparts believed
   there is a cure for AIDS.  The main sources of information about AIDS
   for urban and rural students, respectively, were: newspaper articles
   (56.89% and 21.15%), television (62.07% and 50.00%), magazine articles
   (34.49% and 9.62%), conversations with friends (25.89% and 11.54%), and
   discussions with health care professionals (13.79% and 1.92%).  82.76%
   of urban students and 67.31% of rural students were afraid of
   contracting HIV/AIDS, while 29.31% and 61.54%, respectively, feared
   someone in their family might become infected.  Finally, 63.79% of urban
   and 51.92% of rural adolescents were aware that a person can be
   HIV-infected yet appear healthy.  Overall, these findings indicate that,
   although these secondary school students had acquired information about
   AIDS from a variety of sources, much of this information was inaccurate.
   There is a need for school-based sex education programs to deepen
   students' knowledge of HIV/AIDS.

AB BACKGROUND: Prevention and control of disease and injury require information about the leading medical causes of illness and exposures or risk factors. The assessment of the public-health importance of these has been hampered by the lack of common methods to investigate the overall, worldwide burden. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) provides a standardised approach to epidemiological assessment and uses a standard unit, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to aid comparisons.; METHODS: DALYs for each age-sex group in each GBD region for 107 disorders were calculated, based on the estimates of mortality by cause, incidence, average age of onset, duration, and disability severity. Estimates of the burden and prevalence of exposure in different regions of disorders attributable to malnutrition, poor water supply, sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene, unsafe sex, tobacco use, alcohol, occupation, hypertension, physical inactivity, use of illicit drugs, and air pollution were developed.; FINDINGS: Developed regions account for 11.6% of the worldwide burden from all causes of death and disability, and account for 90.2% of health expenditure worldwide. Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders explain 43.9%; non-communicable causes 40.9%; injuries 15.1%; malignant neoplasms 5.1%; neuropsychiatric conditions 10.5%; and cardiovascular conditions 9.7% of DALYs worldwide. The ten leading specific causes of global DALYs are, in descending order, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, perinatal disorders, unipolar major depression, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, measles, road-traffic accidents, and congenital anomalies. 15.9% of DALYs worldwide are attributable to childhood malnutrition and 6.8% to poor water, and sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene.; INTERPRETATION: The three leading contributors to the burden of disease are communicable and perinatal disorders affecting children. The substantial burdens of neuropsychiatric disorders and injuries are under-recognised. The epidemiological transition in terms of DALYs has progressed substantially in China, Latin America and the Caribbean, other Asia and islands, and the middle eastern crescent. If the burdens of disability and death are taken into account, our list differs substantially from other lists of the leading causes of death. DALYs provide a common metric to aid meaningful comparison of the burden of risk factors, diseases, and injuries. 
A2 The Global Burden of Disease Study used the disability-adjusted
   life-year (DALY) to compare death and disability from various disorders
   in developing and developed countries.  In 1990, developing countries
   carried almost 90% of the global disease burden yet were recipients of
   only 10% of global health care funding.  The highest disease burdens
   were in sub-Saharan Africa (21.4% of global total) and India (20.9%). 
   Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders (group 1
   causes) predominated in sub-Saharan Africa (65.9% of burden), while
   noncommunicable diseases (group 2 causes) accounted for 80% of the
   burden in established market economies; injuries (group 3) did not
   differ substantially across regions.  The ratio of group 2 to group 1
   disorders can be used as a measure of the epidemiologic transition. 
   Group 2 disorders already surpass group 1 disorders in China, Latin
   America, and the Caribbean.  On a global level, group 1, 2, and 3 causes
   accounted for 43.9%, 40.9%, and 15.1%, respectively, of DALYs.  Overall,
   the top 3 causes of DALYs in 1990 were lower respiratory infections,
   diarrheal diseases, and perinatal disorders (low birth weight and birth
   asphyxia or birth trauma).  In developed countries, these causes were
   ischemic heart disease, unipolar major depression, and cerebrovascular
   diseases.  Malnutrition was the risk factor responsible for the greatest
   loss of DALYs (15.9%), followed by poor water supply, sanitation, and
   personal hygiene (6.8%).

AB Sequence of drug use was examined in a secondary analysis of two samples of serious drug users: one of 152 men and one of 133 women. The proportions of drug users following specified patterns of drug use onset were compared to proportions obtained in previous research in samples of high school youth, and serious drug users. The serious drug users were substantially different from high school samples in their progression of drug use. The serious drug users were less likely to follow the typical sequence identified in previous studies (alcohol, then marijuana, followed by other illicit drugs). They were more likely to have used marijuana before using alcohol, and more likely to have used other illicit drugs before using marijuana. We also found that atypical sequencing was associated with earlier initiation of the use of illicit drugs other than marijuana and greater lifetime drug involvement. These findings suggest that for a large number of serious drug users, marijuana does not play the role of a 'gateway drug'. We conclude that prevention efforts which focus on alcohol and marijuana may be of limited effectiveness for youth who are at risk for serious drug abuse.

AB In a systematic review we assessed the methodological quality of evaluations of alcohol misuse prevention programmes for young people, and recorded evidence of effectiveness. Studies were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases; hand searches of all obtained papers, existing reviews and several journals; and mailshots to key organizations, conferences and individuals. Relevant papers were checked and cross-checked by members of the review team, and only those studies with an experimental or quasi-experimental design and positive attributes on a number of other quality criteria were included in the review. After pre-screening over 500 papers which reported prevention programmes, information was systematically abstracted from 155 papers. Only 33 studies merited inclusion in the review, and most of these had some methodological shortcomings. Twenty-one studies reported some significant short- and medium-term reductions in drinking behaviour. Of two studies which carried out longer-term evaluations, only one reported a significant longer-term effect, with small effect sizes. No factors clearly distinguished partially effective from ineffective or harmful prevention programmes. In conclusion, the lack of reliable evidence means that no one type of prevention programme can be recommended. In particular there is a need to carry out well-designed scientific evaluations of the effectiveness of current or new prevention efforts which target young people's alcohol misuse.

AB PURPOSE: To assess human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors of street youth and to determine whether risk behaviors differ by gender or housing status.; METHODS: Using systematic street-based sampling in four Northern California cities, we recruited 429 street youth (mean age = 19.2 years). Participants completed a structured interview which was used to assess sexual and drug HIV risk behaviors.; RESULTS: The majority of youth were heterosexual (85%), white (77%), male (68%), and currently without any type of stable housing (75%). Although 60% of the sample had had vaginal sex in the past 30 days, only 44% used a condom the last time they had sex. About one-third (32%) of the sample reported ever injecting drugs, and almost all reported lifetime use of multiple drugs including D-lysergic acid diethylamide (96%), marijuana (90%), alcohol (81%), cocaine (70%), and speed (70%). Compared to males, females were equally likely to use injection and noninjection drugs, but were more likely to be sexually active (P < .001), were more likely to have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (P = .005), and were less likely to report consistent condom use (P = .003) or intent to use condoms consistently in the future (P = .005). Compared with those with stable housing, youth who were currently without such housing reported higher rates of injection, and other drug use; females without stable housing were less likely to have used condoms the last time they had vaginal intercourse.; CONCLUSION: The high level of HIV risk behavior in this street-based sample of youth, particularly females and youth without stable housing, suggests an urgent need for gender-specific prevention efforts and an increased range of housing options.

AB PURPOSE: To advocate strategies to promote the health of young people that include action to create supportive social and economic conditions, alongside more traditional actions to strengthen individual capacity to protect health.; METHODS: Analysis of different strategies for youth health promotion from different countries, including education, public policies, laws, and regulations that protect young people from exploitation and physical harm, and enhance their capacity to make healthy lifestyle choices.; RESULTS: Access to education and the promotion of basic literacy are, in their own right, important public health goals. Beyond this, efforts to promote health through schools should focus on the creation of an integrated and mutually reinforcing set of experiences for young people, including classroom health education, the creation of a safe and healthy physical environment, and provision of appropriate school health services. The creation of supportive social and economic conditions are also essential, and require political action through the development of public policy. Such policies include restricting access to tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs, improving access to essential health services; and regulation of economic exploitation of young people.; CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion is inherently political. Health professionals have to find ways to become more effective political advocates for young people. This should be reflected in the education of health professionals and educators, and in the work of agencies and professional associations. 
A2 Strategies from different countries for youth health promotion were
   analyzed.  These strategies include measures in education, public
   policies, laws, and regulations which protect young people from
   exploitation and physical harm, and enhance their capacity to make
   healthy lifestyle choices.  While access to education and the promotion
   of basic literacy are important public health goals, efforts to promote
   health through schools should focus upon the creation of an integrated
   and mutually reinforcing set of experiences for young people, including
   classroom health education, the creation of a safe and healthy physical
   environment, and provision of appropriate school health services.  The
   creation of supportive social and economic conditions is also essential
   and requires political action through the development of public policy. 
   Such policies include restricting access to tobacco, alcohol, and
   illegal drugs; improving access to essential health services; and
   legislating against the economic exploitation of youth.  Health
   professionals must find ways to become more effective political
   advocates for young people.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare response distributions in health surveys for two interview modes: face-to-face household interviews and telephone interviews. There were two samples of the Perth metropolitan general population aged 16 to 69 years: a face-to-face household sample (n = 1000) and a telephone sample (n = 222). The samples were generated by probability-based methods commonly used by commercial market research organisations. The surveys occurred in August-September 1992 as part of a larger statewide survey component of a three-year evaluation of the Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation. Respondents were drawn from a two-stage cluster sample based on private dwellings for personal interviews, and from randomly selected listed and unlisted private numbers for telephone interviews. Although the samples did not differ significantly on a number of variables, the telephone sample was significantly higher in residential social status; there was significantly lower reporting of smoking and lower unsafe alcohol consumption in the telephone sample: significantly higher proportions of the telephone sample were in Prochaska's 'action' stage of change for several health behaviours; and there was significantly greater recall of health messages in the telephone sample. Health researchers should treat comparisons between different survey modes with caution, and should be aware that campaign evaluations using telephone surveys and household surveys may yield substantially different results.

AB Evaluation research of public health media campaigns to influence behavior change often bemoans the lack of relevance to target audience and an absence of integrated interpersonal and mass-mediated communication channels. The assumption that illegal drug users are disconnected from mass-mediated communication may account for this absence of media interventions. The authors used cross-tabulation, chi-square, and regression analyses to demonstrate that many out-of-treatment drug users in an HIV-prevention research project are media consumers and that participants who recalled seeing or hearing media interventions reported greater levels of positive behavior change than participants who did not recall such messages. Results suggest coordination of human and mass-mediated public health messages relevant to this population to facilitate behavior changes.

AB In a senior high school in the Weicheng District of Weifang City, we studied the health of a total 445 students. The age of the first emission was 15.22 +/- 2.24 years, and the age of menarche was 13.56 +/- 2.26 years. Because 47.9% of boys and 63.8% of girls did not have previous knowledge about puberty, 39.9% of boys and 52.2% of girls felt puzzled and disgusted with the onset of puberty. About 18% of boys and about 2% of girls reported masturbation. The average frequency of masturbation was 3.5 times a month in the boys and two times monthly in girls. Adolescents acquired sexual knowledge and information predominantly from magazines (25.8% of boys and 28.0% of girls). About 64% of boys and 44% of girls wanted to be given educational programs on sex. About 43% of boys and 1% of girls smoked cigarettes and 83.5% of boys and 54.9% of girls drank alcohol. The survey suggested that it is essential to teach the senior high school students about the psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of adolescence and promote research on adolescent medicine. 
A2 163 male and 282 female students aged 10-18 years during 1993-94 at a
   senior high school in the Weicheng District of Weifang City completed
   questionnaires on their sex-related knowledge and behavior.  41% of boys
   and 10% of girls did not answer the question on age at first semen
   emission and menarche, respectively.  However, of those who did respond
   to the question, the mean age at first emission was 15.22 years and the
   age of menarche was 13.56 years.  34% of boys and 25% of girls were
   confused by the onset of puberty; 47.9% of all boys and 63.8% of all
   girls had no previous knowledge of puberty.  Approximately 18% of boys
   and 2% of girls reported masturbation, although 20% and 18% of the
   entire sample, respectively, provided no response to the question on
   masturbation.  The boys and girls who admitted to masturbating did so an
   average of 3.5 and 2 times per month, respectively.  Masturbation has
   long been considered an obscene, sinful behavior in China.  All
   participants denied having sexual intercourse.  25.8% of boys and 28.0%
   of girls acquired their sexual knowledge and information from magazines,
   and 64% of boys and 44% of girls wanted educational programs on sex. 
   43% of boys and 1% of girls smoked cigarettes and 83.5% of boys and

AB Binge drinking (heavy, episodic alcohol consumption), tobacco, and illicit drug use among a random sample of 140 American colleges were examined by means of a mail survey. Students were divided into three groups on the basis of their involvement in athletics: whether they were involved, partly involved, or not involved. In addition, individual correlates of binge drinking among athletically involved students were studied. The survey results indicated that students involved in college athletics engaged in binge drinking and tobacco more often than students not involved in athletics, but were less likely to be cigarette smokers or marijuana users. The strongest predictors of binge drinking among students involved in athletics were residence in a fraternity or a sorority, a party lifestyle, engagement in other risky behaviors, and previous binging in high school. Coaches may play an important role in discouraging substance use and need to be a part of campus prevention efforts.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the appeal of "designer drinks" to young people.; DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative research comprising group discussions and questionnaire led interviews with young people accompanied by a self completion questionnaire.; SETTINGS: Argyll and Clyde Health Board area, west Scotland.; SUBJECTS: Eight groups aged 12-17 years; 824 aged 12-17 recruited by multistage cluster probability sample from the community health index.; RESULTS: Young people were familiar with designer drinks, especially MD 20/20 and leading brands of strong white cider. Attitudes towards these drinks varied quite distinctly with age, clearly reflecting their attitudes towards and motivations for drinking in general. The brand imagery of designer drinks-in contrast with that of more mainstream drinks-matched many 14 and 15 year olds' perceptions and expectations of drinking. Popularity of designer drinks peaked between the ages of 13 and 16 while more conventional drinks showed a consistent increase in popularity with age. Consumption of designer drinks tended to be in less controlled circumstances and was associated with heavier alcohol intake and greater drunkenness.; CONCLUSIONS: Designer drinks are a cause for concern. They appeal to young people, often more so than conventional drinks, and are particularly attractive to 14-16 year olds. Consumption of designer drinks is also associated with drinking in less controlled environments, heavier drinking, and greater drunkenness. There is a need for policy debate to assess the desirability of these drinks and the extent to which further controls on their marketing are required.

AB PURPOSE: Guided by information processing theory and the health belief model, this paper considers the relationship between health consciousness among the general population and attention to environmental health warnings about alcohol consumption. Mechanisms of exposure to three dominant types of impersonal alcohol-related health messages in the environment are explored.; DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey using telephone interview data.; SUBJECTS: A representative nationwide sample of adults was interviewed in 1993 (n = 1026), with a response rate of 63%.; MEASURES: Key variables include exposure to warning labels on alcoholic beverages, to point-of-sale posters, and to advertisements in the media, as well as respondents' alcohol consumption, health problems (indicative of salience of health warnings), and level of health consciousness assessed by items tapping concern with nutrition and seeking information on health topics.; RESULTS: In the total sample, over a third had seen a warning label or poster and almost all had seen an advertisement about the risks associated with alcohol consumption in 1993. Survey respondents scored very high on five individual items that make up the health consciousness scale introduced here, with 69% endorsing all items. The scale demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha = .70) and was significantly correlated (p < .01) with not enjoying getting drunk and with usually reading product warning labels, suggesting construct validity. Yet the hypothesized strong relationships between health consciousness and attention to health warnings about drinking were not observed; nor was salience of messages a predictor of recall. Importantly, high proportions of underage drinkers and young adults at elevated risk for drinking problems are reached by container warning label messages. Mechanisms of exposure recall vary based on message source, with "container label recall" associated with heavier drinking, younger age, and purchasing patterns; "poster recall" associated with purchasing and health consciousness; and "advertisement recall" associated with heavy consumption and younger age.; CONCLUSIONS: These results are contrary to predictions from skeptics of broad-based informational interventions, who argue that only the already-health conscious are attentive to health warnings about the risks of alcohol consumption. These data suggest that the label is reaching intended target audiences, especially younger people, males, and heavier alcohol consumers. Future research in predicting attention to impersonal health warnings in the environment should continue to improve the assessment of constructs such as salience and health consciousness, and should further test the applicability of available theoretical models. Subsequent research should also consider additional measures to tap mechanisms of exposure to impersonal health messages to enable a better understanding of the population that is not being reached by such public health interventions.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of personality dimensions measured at ages 6 and 10 years in predicting early onset of cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, and other drug use in boys. In addition, the stability of the prediction between the measurements at ages 6 and 10 years was investigated.; METHODS: Data from a large longitudinal study of boys were used to assess the relation between childhood personality and the onset of substance use from 10 to 15 years of age. Childhood personalities were assessed by teachers' ratings of behaviors. Self-reports of smoking cigarettes, getting drunk, and using other drugs provided the measurement of substance use. Discrete-time survival analysis was used for the statistical analyses.; RESULTS: High novelty-seeking and low harm avoidance significantly predict early onset of substance use (eg, cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs), but reward dependence was unrelated to any of the outcomes studied. The results also indicated that either set of predictors (ie, the personality dimensions measured at ages 6 and 10 years) could be used to predict onset of cigarette smoking, getting drunk, and other drug use, because the power of prediction was similar between the measurements at ages 6 and 10 years.; CONCLUSIONS: High novelty-seeking and low harm avoidance lead to early onset of substance use in boys. The stability of the prediction between ages 6 and 10 years suggests that the kindergarten assessments may be used for preventive efforts at school entry instead of waiting until early adolescence.

AB Despite drug education and prevention efforts, adolescent substance use is on the rise in the United States. In an exploration of correlates of substance use and components of effective drug education, three dimensions of religiosity--religious proscriptiveness, involvement in church activities, and the importance an individual places on church activities--emerge. Each has previously demonstrated an inverse relationship with adolescent substance use. In the present study, interactions among these three dimensions were evaluated in 238 adolescents. Religious proscriptiveness interacted with church involvement and with church importance in relation to adolescent use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and other drugs. Additionally, among adolescents who had ever used alcohol, a positive relationship was observed between religious proscriptiveness and binge drinking such that the highest incidence of binge drinking was reported by those affiliated with proscriptive religious groups. The church may be an important vehicle for drug education. Implications for drug education are discussed, and further research is suggested.

AB BACKGROUND: The regional poison information center is a potential sentinel for substance abuse patterns. Its central data collection system allows it to access information from large population groups. We report results from a one year prospective cases series of inhalation abuse from two regional poison information centers.; DESIGN: Prospective case series. All inhalation exposures reported to two regional poison information centers with a reason of intentional abuse were included.; RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five cases were collected. One hundred twenty-four exposures (75%) were male. Age ranged from 4 to 45 y, with a mean, median and mode of 16.6 (SD 7.3), 15 and 13, respectively. Nine children were < 6 years old. There were 22 substances involved, but two substances (spray paint and gasoline) accounted for more than 61% of all cases. In children < 9 y (n = 18, 11%) gasoline alone accounted for 83% of exposures. Abuse occurred statewide, in both urban and rural settings, but tended to occur more often in rural environments (75%). Abuse was reported throughout the day with a peak incidence at 8 pm. One hundred twenty-three patients received direct medical evaluation or care. There was one fatality in this series and 15 patients were described as having life threatening symptoms.; CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation abuse may begin very early in childhood and abuse appears to peak in adolescence. The regional poison information center can act as a sentinel for abuse patterns. This information can assist health care providers in poison and abuse prevention efforts.

A2 In Viet Nam, the 1990 designation of population as a top government
   concern resulted in a tenfold increase in spending on family planning
   (FP) and health.  The Viet Nam FP Association has developed a number of
   innovative ways of promoting FP, including a telephone counseling
   service.  The population of Viet Nam has doubled since 1960, and the
   average per capita income remains very low; thus, condoms and oral
   contraceptives (OCs) are prohibitively expensive for many families.  The
   FP program provides free condoms, OCs, and IUDs but often runs out of
   supplies.  Need for condoms is estimated at 200 million/year, but the
   two factories only produce 30 million.  OCs are imported from Hungary
   and have a bad reputation among Vietnamese women.  The most commonly
   used contraceptive is the IUD, but poor quality of care at insertion
   leads many women to suffer infections.  Viet Nam has a high rate of
   legal abortion, with most procedures occurring in the first month of
   pregnancy.  The FP Association has cautiously introduced sex education
   in the schools in a pilot program that will be continued nationwide. 
   The Association also opened a special club for young people and one for
   miliary personnel.  These clubs provide contraceptive information along
   with soft drinks and music.  The government's two-child policy is widely
   accepted but must overcome the obstacles of large family preference in
   rural areas and of son preference.

AB There are a number of sources of variability in food consumption patterns and residue levels of a particular chemical (e.g., pesticide, food additive) in commodities that lead to an expected high level of variability in dietary exposures across a population. This paper focuses on examples of consumption pattern survey data for specific commodities, namely that for wine and grape juice, and demonstrates how such data might be analyzed in preparation for performing stochastic analyses of dietary exposure. Data from the NIAAA/NHIS wine consumption survey were subset for gender and age group and, with matched body weight data from the survey database, were used to define empirically-based percentile estimates for wine intake (microliter wine/kg body weight) for the strata of interest. The data for these two subpopulations were analyzed to estimate 14-day consumption distributional statistics and distributions for only those days on which wine was consumed. Data subsets for all wine-consuming adults and wine-consuming females ages 18 through 45, were determined to fit a lognormal distribution (R2 = 0.99 for both datasets). Market share data were incorporated into estimation of chronic exposures to hypothetical chemical residues in imported table wine. As a separate example, treatment of grape juice consumption data for females, ages 18-40, as a simple lognormal distribution resulted in a significant underestimation of intake, and thus exposure, because the actual distribution is a mixture (i.e., multiple subpopulations of grape juice consumers exist in the parent distribution). Thus, deriving dietary intake statistics from food consumption survey data requires careful analysis of the underlying empirical distributions.

AB It was the aim of the present study to evaluate how adolescents in Germany accept and consume the new caffeinated drinks (NCD), which can now be legally marketed in Germany. In summer and fall 1994, three surveys were carried out at different schools in Germany, (Aachen, Cologne, Wuppertal, Berlin-West and Berlin-Ost). 1,265 boys and girls were asked for acquaintance with NCD (module I) and 875 of them about consumption (module II). With 727 pupils a third question (module III) was applied by which consumption of Cola drinks compared to that of NCD could be quantified. In total, 93.6% of the young people indicated to know about the NCD, and 53.3% to have tasted these new drinks. Consumption was reported as sometimes (< 1 can/week) from 23% and as repeatedly (1-7 cans/week) from 3%. Acquaintance and consumption were clearly related to age and gender, but even the youngest group (10-13 years old) indicated to have tasted the NCD (30.7% in females and 50% in males) and to drink them sometimes (5.2% in females and 23.1% in males). In the series with question module III 9.5% reported not to drink cola, 36.6% to drink cola "sometimes", 30.9% "repeatedly", 8.6% "often" and 11.6% "frequently" (> 2 cans/day). The corresponding figures for the NCD were 69.9% (non-drinkers), 23.3% "sometimes", 3.3% "repeatedly", 0.3% ten nd 0.6% "frequently". The results suggest that all young people in Germany know about the NCD but actually consume these new drinks moderately. They prefer cola drinks. The observation, however, that a small group may consume extreme amounts and that even very young pupils consume the NCD regularly should give rise to have a close look at the consumption pattern in the near future.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study examined the associations between physical activity and other health behaviors in a representative sample of US adolescents.; METHODS: In the 1990 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 11631 high school students provided information on physical activity; diet; substance use; and other negative health behaviors. Logistic regression analyses examined associations between physical activity and other health behaviors in a subset of 2652 high-active and 1641 low-active students.; RESULTS: Low activity was associated with cigarette smoking, marijuana use, lower fruit and vegetable consumption, greater television watching, failure to wear a seat belt, and low perception of academic performance. For consumption of fruit, television watching, and alcohol consumption, significant interactions were found with race/ethnicity or sex, suggesting that sociocultural factors may affect the relationships between physical activity and some health behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: Low physical activity was associated with several other negative health behaviors in teenagers. Future studies should examine whether interventions for increasing physical activity in youth can be effective in reducing negative health behaviors.

AB PURPOSE: Educators and producers should take advantage of television's potential for reaching audiences with health-related messages. This paper investigates adolescents' perceptions of an anti-alcohol message embedded in commercial television programming.; METHODS: Over 900 8th and 9th graders from New York suburbs completed surveys measuring interest, knowledge, and credibility of either an episode of The Cosby Show or Family Matters. Both episodes had an anti-alcohol message embedded within their plots.; RESULTS: Overall, students gave high rates of interest and credibility and received high scores for knowledge for both episodes. Girls and African-American students had higher scores, on average, for interest and credibility. White students had the highest knowledge scores. Students with different television viewing experiences did not differ in their perceptions of the episodes; however, students who had previously seen the episodes gave higher levels of interest and credibility.; CONCLUSION: These data indicate that youngsters are receptive to antialcohol messages within commercial television episodes. The results also suggest that similarities and differences between a viewer and a televised character relate to differences in perception. However, much more research should be done in order to generalize these findings to other audiences, episodes, programs, and health-related messages.

AB In Norway the law forbids drinking of alcohol before the age of 18 years. In spite of this, a large portion of Norwegian under-aged adolescents report drinking alcohol. A two-year prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate perceived access to alcohol in a representative sample of 7th grade students (13 years old) in the county of Hordaland, Norway (N = 861). "Getting older friends to buy alcohol", "given alcohol by friends", and "taking at home without permission" were the most frequently mentioned sources of alcohol both at baseline and at follow-up among both drinking and non-drinking students. Among 15 year old boys who reported drinking alcohol, 21% said that they would buy the alcohol themselves. Perceived access to alcohol significantly predicted the reported frequency of alcohol use two years later, even when controlled for baseline alcohol consumption and perceived social norms among parents and students of the same age. It is recommended that parents be advised to reduce their children's access to alcohol at home, and that alcohol prevention efforts targeting older adolescents should include information on the negative consequences of providing alcohol to minors. Furthermore, the current sales laws should be more stringently enforced.

AB Sources of HIV information were examined for 774 male and female injecting drug users (IDUs). The majority (80.7%) had received HIV information from one or more sources in the prior 3 months. The most frequently mentioned sources were television (39.9%) and friends or family (22.2%). There were few differences in source of HIV information with regard to gender, ethnicity, or age. Differences were more frequently observed between cities. The relationship of information source and subject characteristics with HIV knowledge, perceived risk, drug-related and sexual practices was examined using logistic regression. For men, exposure to mass media sources (OR = 1.48) and small media materials (OR = 2.03) were related to HIV knowledge. Small media and interpersonal information were related to HIV testing for men (OR = 1.95 and 1.85, respectively) and women (OR = 2.25 and 2.54). Interpersonal sources of information were also associated with increased sharing of injection equipment (OR = 2.04) and bleach use (OR = 2.23) among female IDUs. Significant differences in HIV knowledge and risk-related practices were also observed for ethnicity, city, men who have sex with men, and women who had traded sex for money or drugs. Implications for targeting HIV prevention efforts for IDUs are discussed.

AB The purpose of this paper was to analyse the role of social class concerning changes in alcohol consumption and severe alcohol-related problems from the end of the 1960s to the 1990s in Stockholm County, and in the whole of Sweden for consumption. Survey data showed that the prevalence of moderate and/or high alcohol consumption in adults of both sexes was highest among non-manual employees at medium and high level, in 1967 as well as in 1980 in the whole of Sweden. After 1980, an equalization occurred. A similar change in the social class pattern of alcohol consumption was noted in young people. We analysed all 36,404 male and 10,648 female hospitalizations and all the 3175 male and 713 female deaths with a diagnosis of alcoholism, alcohol psychosis or alcohol intoxication in Stockholm County during 1970-86 (1970-84 for mortality) linked to individual census data. There was a greater increase in rates among women than among men, especially among women outside the labour market. We found pronounced social class differences between manual and non-manual employees, which widened up to 1986 (1984 for mortality)-a period with an initial increase and a subsequent decrease in alcohol consumption. Thus, the changes in consumption and alcohol-related problems developed differently in principal social classes over time, suggesting that an expanded theory on alcohol consumption in the population should take socio-economic factors into account.

AB Self Enhancement, Inc., is a grassroots, community-service organization working in the most disadvantaged high-risk community in Portland, Oregon. Its violence-prevention program targets middle-school and high-school students by providing classroom and community activities to these young people. These activities are designed to enhance protective factors and build resilience in youths to enable them to attain healthy and productive lives and to resist the threats of gangs, violence, and drugs. RMC Research Corporation works in partnership with Self Enhancement, Inc., to conduct research and evaluation on the effectiveness of its programs. The Self Enhancement, Inc., program works primarily at the individual student and interpersonal relationship levels. Resilience Theory and its culturally specific Relationship Model drive the formulation of specific strategies and activities. Program staff mentor each student through his or her preadolescent and adolescent years, promoting positive, prosocial norms and expectations for behavior through their peer group activities. The Self Enhancement, Inc., program consists of three major components: classroom, exposure, and proactive education. Classroom education focuses on anger management, conflict resolution, and problem solving. Exposure education consists of quarterly field trips to agencies and organizations in the Portland area that deal with the causes and consequences of violence in the community. Proactive education includes newsletters, student-run assemblies and conferences, and radio/ television public service announcements that communicate antiviolence messages. The evaluation plan is a longitudinal matched comparison group designed to assess the outcomes of the violence-prevention program. Key outcomes are protective factors, health-risk behaviors, and academic measures. Standardized assessment instruments (the Individual Protective Factors Index and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey) were administered to all students during winter 1994. The instruments will be readministered during the same period in the following two years of the project. School records were extracted to assess students' attendance and progress through their academic programs. Of the 326 seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-grade students participating in this study, 95% are African Americans and 51% are boys. The prevalence of fighting (56%) during the past 12 months is higher than that among African-American high-school students nationally, but weapon carrying (27%), alcohol use (30%), and marijuana use (18%) are the same or lower than national averages for this group. All baseline indicators are equivalent between the program and comparison groups with the exception of weapon carrying. Program students report carrying weapons more than do their comparison group counterparts. Baseline indicators of violence-related behaviors clearly indicate the need for intervention in this highly disadvantaged, African-American community. Through its historical presence and recent program development efforts, Self Enhancement, Inc., is well positioned to make a difference in the lives of these young people. The equivalence of program and comparison group students on baseline indicators of violence bodes well for an unequivocal assessment of program effectiveness over time.

AB The present study investigated the role of parental use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana on lagged changes in the specific substance use of their adolescent offspring over a six-year period. The analyses also examined the relative influence of mothers and fathers and their interaction as moderated by marital status and age and gender of the adolescent. A generalized estimating equations approach, analogous to quasi-like-lihood, was employed to estimate regression coefficients via an iterative weighted least squares algorithm. Findings indicated that, when employed as time-varying covariates, parental substance use resulted in substance-specific effects on fluctuations in the adolescent's own use. Age, parent marital status, and each parent's marijuana use independently were jound to significantly affect adolescent marijuana use. In contrast, the complex relationship between parent and adolescent use of alcohol and cigarettes showed variation by substance, age, and gender of both parents and adolescents. Within a developmental context, the results suggest that parent use of substances must be considered risk factors with particular effects on their younger offspring. Thus, prevention efforts should be directed at middle childhood and include components aimed at parents as well as their children.

AB OBJECTIVE: A growing number of studies have examined the role of genetic and environmental influences on various aspects of alcohol use and abuse for women and men. We briefly review relevant twin and adoption studies; overall, these studies suggest: (1) both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of various alcohol-related problems, (2) these factors affect both males and females, and (3) genetic factors may be more significant for males than females.; METHOD: This study is the first to address the question of genetic and environmental effects using data from a nationally representative probability sample, the National Health Interview Survey, 1988 Alcohol Supplement (NHIS-88A). We model the effects of biological family history of alcoholism (FHB) and environmental exposure to alcoholism during childhood (FHE) on (1) whether the respondent ever drank (current/former drinker), and, given that the respondent is a current drinker, (2) whether he or she developed DSM-III-R symptoms of alcohol dependence.; RESULTS: Results suggest (1) main effects of FHB and FHE on both current/former drinker and alcohol dependence and (2) evidence of greater FHB effects among males. No other gender differences were detected, and no gene by environment interaction effects were found, either for all respondents or by gender.; CONCLUSIONS: Results are consistent with previous research showing a greater effect of genetic risk factors among men than women, yet important effects of both environment and genetic factors for both sexes. The study design appears to provide an alternative to standard twin and adoption studies as a way to separate genetic and environmental risk factors, with both advantages and disadvantages compared to such designs. Some of these disadvantages might be addressed in questionnaire construction, but some are probably inherent.

A2 As AIDS increasingly affects youth, the Papua New Guinea Institute of
   Medical Research, at the request of the WHO, entered into a comparative
   study of youth and sexuality.  The study design compared young people
   living in rural, periurban, and urban environments.  The assessment
   process, in which rural areas where examined for comparability, was
   divided into three phases, namely, 1) public norms were investigated
   through focus group discussion with both young people and adults, 2)
   private lives were recounted and media exposure examined, and 3)
   vignettes were used for topics such as masturbation, homosexuality,
   group sex, and rape.  The information gathered in this study revealed
   that marijuana, which is known to enhance disinhibited sexuality, was
   more widely used than alcohol.  Pornography was also reported to be one
   of the few available sources of information available on sex,
   particularly in the rural areas, where no other type of reading material
   provided information on sex and sexuality.  Condoms were found to be
   widely known as protection from STDs by young people, although they were
   rarely used due the difficulty in acquiring them.  Instead, circumcision
   was widely promoted in all areas as a substitute for condom use in
   protecting against HIV and STDs.  There were no significant differences
   between the values of urban youth and those of rural youth.  Young men
   were found to be more subject to peer pressure and more concerned with
   their capacity to earn a living.  Although religious values were
   frequently mentioned in the context of acquiring a Christian spouse,
   they were not reflected in the behavior of a majority of the youth. 
   These findings suggest that the prevention campaign targeted on the
   young generation should include a wide distribution of interesting
   printed materials stating facts about the transmission of STDs.  In
   addition, there should also be a widespread distribution of free or
   inexpensive condoms in all areas in Papua New Guinea, without any
   restrictions being imposed on the youth.

HIV risk was highest among women who accurately perceived themselves to be at increased HIV risk, held strong beliefs about barriers to condom use, and reported weak behavioral intentions to reduce risk. Women at higher risk were also younger and reported higher rates of alcohol and substance use.; CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention efforts are needed for inner-city women. Interventions should focus on overcoming women's barriers to condom use, strengthening their intentions to change behaviors, and managing the risk related to their use of substances.

AB Although primary prevention efforts aimed at reducing heart disease have focused on adults, there is evidence that risk factors for heart disease are likely to be present in children and adolescents. To identify the risk factors present in adolescent boys, 82 male adolescents were enrolled in a study. Blood pressure, cholesterol, percent body fat, and body mass index (BMI) were measured along with data collection pertaining to diets, substance use, stress, and family history of heart disease. A statistically significant number of adolescent male subjects had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high percent body fat, and high BMI and used substances associated with heart disease (smoking cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, and amino acids). Thus, interventions must begin early in life if heart disease is to be prevented.

AB In Japan, the mean DMFT at 12 years of age increased from 2.8 in 1957 to 5.9 in 1975. From the 1981 survey (DMFT = 5.43), conversely, the mean DMFT decreased and reached 3.64 in 1993. The increase in caries prevalence can, without doubt, be explained by an increment of sugar consumption, since the intake of sugar increased after World War II and exceeded 18.25 kg/year (50 g/day) in 1965 and reached a maximum value (29.3 kg/year) in 1973 in Japan. On the other hand, the reason why the DMFT has decreased since 1981 is not clear. In many industrialized countries, a caries reduction has been achieved with acceptable fluoride exposure, although sugar consumption was still at a high level. However, fluoride usage was still limited during the last 2 decades in Japan. There is no community where fluoridated drinking water has been supplied since 1972. Fluoride tablet use was also discontinued for children in the 1970s. Fluoride mouthrinsing programs were available for only 1% of school children in 1992. Moreover, the market share of fluoridated dentifrices stayed at 10% until 1986 and became 30% only in 1988. An excellent correlation (r = 0.91; P < 0.01) is observed between the DMFT in 12-year-olds and per capita sugar consumption per year between 1957 and 1987 in Japan.

AB This article describes one effort to help prevent violence against women by addressing some of the larger societal factors involved. The Dangerous Promises campaign is based on the premise that sexist advertising images contribute to an environment conducive to violence against women. The goal of the campaign is to convince alcohol companies to eliminate sexist alcohol advertising and promotions. Using the tools of community organizing and media advocacy, the campaign pressures the alcohol industry to change the ways in which they portray women in much of their advertising. Media advocacy has been instrumental in the successes of the campaign. This article examines the strategies and outcomes of the Dangerous Promises efforts to date and makes a case for application of media advocacy as a tool for increasing community voice in policy-making processes.

AB This is the first round in a series of surveys conducted in Fort McMurray as part of the Fort McMurray Demonstration Project in social marketing. This component of the survey was intended to focus on the most prominent group of employed workers in the community and to compare their patterns of response with the community as a whole. Respondents to the survey were overwhelmingly male (96%), married (72.9%) and living in households of two to five persons (87.9%). They were predominantly aged 30-44 (55%) and graduates of high school (53.5%). Younger male workers (below age 30) were more likely to have a high school diploma (78.3%) or some additional technical or vocational training (21.7% compared to 12.5% overall) and to be unmarried or separated. Attitudes toward safety-related behaviours were stronger than for respondents from the community as a whole. Approximately 70-100% of all age groups and both sexes showed strong agreement with attitudes involving child car seats and the unacceptability of drinking and driving. These attitudes include strong advocacy of vigorous enforcement of occupational health and safety standards. However, they showed a variability similar to the community as a whole in behaviour at home compared to work, generally reporting more consistent use of personal protection on the job than in their own homes, particularly hearing protection. Even so, they were much less likely to perform stretching and warm-up exercises prior to exertion than community residents in general. The potential may exist to transfer the technology and attitudes from workplace health and safety to community safety. One possible strategy to accomplish this is to involve workers in this industry directly in community initiatives. This strategy may be generalizable to any community in which there are major employers who place a heavy emphasis on risk control and occupational health and safety.

AB The first year of the mandatory bicycle helmet laws in Australia saw increased helmet wearing from 31% to 75% of cyclists in Victoria and from 31% of children and 26% of adults in New South Wales (NSW) to 76% and 85%. However, the two major surveys using matched before and after samples in Melbourne (Finch et al. 1993; Report No. 45, Monash Univ. Accident Research Centre) and throughout NSW (Smith and Milthorpe 1993; Roads and Traffic Authority) observed reductions in numbers of child cyclists 15 and 2.2 times greater than the increase in numbers of children wearing helmets. This suggests the greatest effect of the helmet law was not to encourage cyclists to wear helmets, but to discourage cycling. In contrast, despite increases to at least 75% helmet wearing, the proportion of head injuries in cyclists admitted or treated at hospital declined by an average of only 13%. The percentage of cyclists with head injuries after collisions with motor vehicles in Victoria declined by more, but the proportion of head injured pedestrians also declined; the two followed a very similar trend. These trends may have been caused by major road safety initiatives introduced at the same time as the helmet law and directed at both speeding and drink-driving. The initiatives seem to have been remarkably effective in reducing road trauma for all road users, perhaps affecting the proportions of victims suffering head injuries as well as total injuries. The benefits of cycling, even without a helmet, have been estimated to outweigh the hazards by a factor of 20 to 1 (Hillman 1993. Cycle helmets-the case for and against. Policy Studies Institute, London). Consequently, a helmet law, whose most notable effect was to reduce cycling, may have generated a net loss of health benefits to the nation. Despite the risk of dying from head injury per hour being similar for unhelmeted cyclists and motor vehicle occupants, cyclists alone have been required to wear head protection. Helmets for motor vehicle occupants are now being marketed and a mandatory helmet law for these road users has the potential to save 17 times as many people from death by head injury as a helmet law for cyclists without the adverse effects of discouraging a healthy and pollution free mode of transport.

AB A survey of 265 college students was conducted to determine HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and perceived self-efficacy with regard to engaging in HIV-protective behaviors. A self-administered 52-item survey was completed by 265 college students (60% response rate). Resident advisors in college dormitories distributed the survey, returned anonymously. Data were analyzed using SPSS to identify differential responses by gender. Although HIV knowledge was high, perceived self-efficacy differed significantly by gender, with men describing themselves as less able to insist upon condom use (P < .00001). Men were also significantly more likely to report using drugs or alcohol in situations likely to lead to a sexual encounter (P < .001) and to having lower self-efficacy in relation to HIV protection than women in such situations (P < .02). Men were also significantly more likely to believe that monogamy obviates the need to use condoms (P < .01). A substantial number of men (13) and women (14.6) say they do not use condoms because they are protected from unwanted pregnancy by pill. Gender-specific HIV education and skills-building programs may improve the success of AIDS prevention efforts by confronting and addressing gender differences. The reliance on hormonal methods of birth control alone may be a barrier to condom use for both male and female adolescents and young adults. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): AIDS; HIV; knowledge, attitudes, and practice; gender; condoms; birth control; family planning; teenage pregnancy.

AB To test the hypothesis that safer sex procedures are less consistently observed by persons under the influence of alcohol, data from the Swiss human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Prevention Study (HIPS) were evaluated. HIPS is a large prospective cohort study involving 724 HIV-negative and mainly heterosexual subjects who entertain casual sexual contacts. Of the 724 participants, 36% reported that they had had sex while under the influence of alcohol. Of this group, 31% indicated that safer sex procedures were neglected owing to the influence of alcohol. No significant differences with regard to unprotected sexual intercourse were found between subjects who combine sex and alcohol and those who do not. The same was found to be true among subjects with different levels of general alcohol consumption. However, a significant correlation was found between the intensity of alcohol consumption (i.e., the quantity of alcohol intake per sitting) and the incidence of unprotected sexual intercourse. These findings show that the relationship between alcohol consumption and safer sex is complex; they also emphasize the need for preventive efforts to reinforce safer sexual behavior, for example through individual counseling of persons at risk for HIV-infection.

AB This article examines how teenagers perceive a show that is both educational and entertaining. In classrooms, 970 students viewed and evaluated one of two videos of a commercial television program featuring an anti-alcohol message. Overall, the sample assessed the programs favorably, finding the messages interesting, credible and understandable. Firsthand experience with alcohol predicted variations in the perception of an anti-alcohol message, while contact with others who use alcohol did not. Regression analysis showed personal experience with alcohol had a strong relationship to interest, a modest relationship to credibility, but no significant relationship to knowledge. In contrast, social contact with those who use alcohol often (i.e. knowing friends and family members who drink) was not significantly associated with the perceptions of an alcohol message on television. Such results suggest that those creating and using mass-media health messages effectively must be aware of the actual firsthand experiences of their audiences.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether differences in perceived riskiness of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were related to self-reported alcohol consumption among a community sample of pregnant women. Further, this study examined the impact of prior experiences on risk perceptions, focusing on previous pregnancy experiences and on previous alcohol-related problems.; METHOD: The hypothesized relationships among variables were tested simultaneously in a structural equation model. Subjects included 159 pregnant women, all of whom drank regularly before pregnancy recognition, who were recruited from prenatal clinics and through newspaper advertisements.; RESULTS: Perceived riskiness of drinking during pregnancy was lower among women who had previously given birth to a healthy child and among women with greater numbers of previous alcohol problems. Prior adverse pregnancy experience did not predict perceived risk. Perceived risk negatively predicted actual alcohol consumption during pregnancy, suggesting that previous healthy pregnancy experiences and alcohol problems increase drinking in pregnancy indirectly, through perceived risk. A direct positive effect from previous alcohol problems to drinking in pregnancy also was observed.; CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that risk perceptions play a role in drinking behavior among pregnant women and help to illuminate the relationship between parity and alcohol consumption. Interventions designed to reduce drinking among pregnant women, which have generally relied on providing information, may be improved by considering the impact of previous experiences and addressing erroneous beliefs.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examines white male adolescent responses to TV beer advertisements with and without sports content and to nonbeer ads when embedded in sports and entertainment programming.; METHOD: A total of 72 advertisements and 24 television program excerpts were randomly sampled from national television programming. White male adolescents (N = 157) recruited in a public school system each viewed six ads (one of each of three types of ad embedded in each of two types of programming) comprising the 2 x 2 x 3 factorial, within-subjects, mixed-model (random and fixed effects) experimental design along with an age-level blocking factor and random factors for commercial and program stimuli. Cognitive responses to each ad were content-analyzed. Individual difference variables including alcohol use behavior, sensation-seeking, masculinity and sports involvement were also measured.; RESULTS: Subjects showed a consistent preference for beer ads with sports content. A significant three-way interaction between ad type, programming type and junior versus senior high-school age level also indicated that sports programming had an inconsistent effect on responses to beer ads but that nonbeer ads were responded to more positively during sports than during entertainment programming. Other analyses showed that subjects were more cognitively resistant to beer ads than to nonbeer ads.; CONCLUSIONS: These results support public and official concerns that sports content in beer ads increase the ads appeal to underage youth. They do not support hypothesized concerns that sports programming might prime adolescents to be more receptive to beer ads. Implications for alcohol education efforts are discussed.

AB To determine effective measures to popularize knowledge on the health effects of smoking and drinking and to change health behavior, an interview survey of 2000 persons aged 18 or older randomly chosen from national census forms throughout Japan was carried out. The coverage rates of the information concerning smoking and drinking were 97.3% and 92.5%, respectively. Television, newspapers and magazines were the major sources of health information concerning smoking and drinking. In addition, men who gave up or controlled smoking or drinking usually obtained health information from doctors, while those who had never controlled smoking usually obtained health information from their friends and families. Men who could not control drinking effectively usually obtained health information from the health examination consultant at the workplace. However, according to the answers from men who gave up or controlled drinking, the health information useful in changing health behavior was obtained from the health examination consultant at the workplace and from persons who had a disease history. Women who gave up or controlled drinking answered that the health information from their friends and families was helpful to change the health behavior.

AB Objectives.Women who have sex with women are a relatively hidden group that has been overlooked in most AIDS research and prevention efforts, primarily because the efficiency of HIV transmission between female partners is believed to be low. Although data are scant, it is commonly assumed that members of this population are not at high risk for HIV infection. However, a recent study of lesbian and bisexual women living in the San Francisco Bay area reported a relatively high seroprevalence rate and has raised additional questions about this group's HIV risk. The present study, the first to focus on lesbian and bisexual women living outside major AIDS epicenters, provides additional evidence. It describes risk factors for HIV transmission among lesbian and bisexual women living in small cities in four geographic regions of the United States.Methods.On three consecutive evenings in 1992, members of the research team distributed anonymous structured written surveys to women patrons as they entered gay bars in each of 16 small cities.Results.Almost 17% of bisexual respondents and 0.5% of lesbians reported having had unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a male during the two months prior to the survey. Almost 10 percent of bisexual women and 8.8% of lesbians in the sample reported a history of injection drug use. Among those women surveyed who said they had been tested, 1.4% reported they were infected with HIV.Conclusions.Self-identified sexual orientation was highly consistent with recent sexual behavior. HIV risk related to sexual behavior was concentrated among self-identified bisexual women. The prevalence of injection drug use was substantial among both bisexual and lesbians. Developers of HIV risk behavior programs should take the prevalence of these risk behaviors into consideration in the design of effective HIV prevention interventions tailored to the needs of this hidden population.

AB Using an expectancy value approach, personal and normative beliefs about the outcome of using dental floss and drinking non-sugared mineral water were studied in a sample of 970 15-year-old adolescents in the county of Hordaland in Norway. The data stem from a survey performed in October 1992. A detailed analysis of these beliefs provides information about which of them should be targeted in a persuasive communication directed at changing behavior. The adolescents evaluated six outcomes of each behavior in terms of how much they wanted or feared them, and rated the probability of each outcomes happening. The adolescents also rated the probability that four significant referents would approve the performance of each behavior and how much they valued the approval of each referent. Subjects with relatively strong and relatively weak intentions to use dental floss and to drink non-sugared mineral water (intenders and non-intenders) were compared with respect to their scores on each measure. A one-way analysis of variance showed consistent differences between intenders and non-intenders. Intenders were more likely to believe that the specified behaviors would result in positive outcomes and they evaluated these outcomes as more desirable than non-intenders. Intenders believed their referens, in particular dentists and parents, to be more concerned about whether or not to perform the specified behaviors than non-intenders. The most promising candidates for persuasive communication among behavioral beliefs with respect to the specified behaviors appeared to be reduced tooth decay and several non, health beliefs in terms of immediate social and sensory concerns.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the stability of body habitus over 15 years in Boston area adult males enrolled in the Normative Aging Study (NAS) and to examine stability as a function of initial leanness or obesity, age and reported body habitus at age 18.; DESIGN: Prospective observational study of anthropometric/clinical measures initiated in 1961-1970, follow-up examinations at regular three and five year intervals. Subjects with complete data at entry, 5, 10 and 15 years.; SUBJECTS: The 2280 Boston area subjects were aged 21-80 years (mean = 42 y) at entry. A subset (n = 350) with complete data for weight (WT) and height (HT) at four points over 15 years provided estimates of body habitus continuity. The prevalence of obesity and age of those studied were comparable to the complete sample of enrolled men (n = 1403) with any missing follow-up measures.; MEASUREMENTS: Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) (weight in kg/height in m2) > or = 27.8 and leanness as BMI < 24.0. Three age categories at baseline (young = 25-39 y; middle = 40-49 y and old = 50-74 y) were used to examine secular and longitudinal changes. Obesity prevalence rates during late adolescence, based on self-reported weights at age 18, were compared with measured prevalence rates at entry and follow-up. Individual changes in BMI over time for each subject were estimated by linear regression and were combined to measure change in age and BMI groups.; RESULTS: Weights and BMI at entry were highly correlated with 18 year values and 15 year follow-up values. New cases of obesity, defined on the basis of BMI, increased over time while the numbers of subjects classified as lean and intermediate decreased. Among oldest subjects both the lean and obese had slight but significant decreases in mean BMI. Among the lean, only the young showed consistent increments.; DISCUSSION: Our results suggest consistency in body habitus among young and middle-aged obese subjects. There was little evidence of long-term reduction. In agreement with previous observations, the current findings of long-term duration in obesity suggest that preventive efforts should be focused on early years.

AB SUMMARY: This study assesses the prevalence of injection-related behaviors that may facilitate HIV transmission even when syringes are not directly shared. Subjects who self-reported practicing these "indirect sharing" behaviors are described, the prevalence of these behaviors are compared with the direct sharing of syringes, and variables independently associated with indirect sharing are determined. Injection-related risks were assessed among 585 injection drug users (IDUs) in Denver, Colorado. Respondents were classified into three groups based on their self-reported injection behaviors: IDUs who directly and indirectly share syringes, IDUs who indirectly share only, and IDUs who neither directly or indirectly share. Indirect sharing was twice as prevalent as direct sharing. IDUs who injected heroin or speedballs were less safe in their injection behavior than those who did not. Drug treatment did not protect against injection-related risk behaviors; however, exposure to community HIV prevention efforts was protective. Indirect sharing behaviors are common, yet their link to HIV transmission remains unrecognized by many IDUs. IDUs must be informed about these additional risk behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: A study of major skiing injuries in children and adolescents. DESIGN AND MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study of patients 18 years old and under admitted to a pediatric trauma center after skiing accidents. A follow-up questionnaire was used to obtain additional information.; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients, of which 34 were male. Age range was 5 to 18 years. Fifty-eight percent of the accidents were collisions with stationary objects. Alcohol and drugs were not implicated. Helmet use was negligible. Head injuries, especially skull fractures, were very common (27), followed by extremity fractures (13), facial fractures (8), and abdominal (6), thoracic (5), and spinal injuries (2). One third had multiple injuries. The average cost was $22,000. There were no deaths, but 26% had long-term sequelae. The skill breakdown was 26% beginner, 29% intermediate, 45% advanced. Willingness to accept responsibility for the accident correlated inversely with skill level.; CONCLUSIONS: Prevention efforts must target excessive speed and loss of control. Beginners must be well supervised on appropriate terrain. The frequency of skull fractures suggests that helmet use should be encouraged for young recreational skiers.

AB To assess relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences in individual cases of drug abuse/dependence, separate scales were constructed from DIS (version III) drug symptom items. Using data from 38 MZ and 35 DZ male twin pairs, items with significant MZ/DZ differences in probandwise concordance were assigned to a genetic scale whereas items without significant MZ/DZ differences were assigned to an environmental scale. As expected, significant differences were found between MZ and DZ twins in intraclass correlations for the genetic but not environmental scale. Genetic scores on drug and alcohol scales were correlated (r = 0.40), whereas environmental scales were not. When scores on the genetic scales were compared, the correlation between drug and alcohol scores within individuals was similar to that across MZ twins, both of which were higher than the correlation across DZ twins. These results suggest (1) relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences in individual cases of drug dependence can be assessed, and (2) common genetic mechanisms may be involved in alcohol and drug dependence.

AB The study is aimed to assess the existing level of knowledge of school children of 9th and 10th classes about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Three high schools in an urban area and three in the villages of a district of North India were included in the study. A pretested closed-ended questionnaire was administered to 336 students available. Overall level of knowledge about AIDS was found to be high. However, there were significant differences in knowledge among rural-urban and male-female students. There were some misconceptions in knowledge regarding transmission, prognosis and prevention. Books and media were the most common sources of information. Most of the students wanted to learn more about AIDS. Since overall knowledge levels were high we conclude that AIDS education should concentrate on clarifying areas of misconceptions. 
A2 To assess current levels of knowledge about AIDS among secondary school
   students in India, a questionnaire was administered to 336 ninth and
   tenth graders (mean age, 15 years) in three rural and three urban
   schools in Haryana State's Ambala District in 1993.  A brief paragraph
   on HIV/AIDS is included in textbooks for ninth and tenth graders in
   Haryana.  85% of students had heard of AIDS; of these, 56% cited sex
   with an infected partner as a means of HIV transmission and 38%
   identified use of unsterilized drug-injecting equipment.  Sexual
   monogamy (49%), condom use (44%), and use of sterilized needles (40%)
   were the main strategies identified for prevention of HIV transmission. 
   Of concern was widespread misinformation about HIV transmission and
   control.  For example, 23% of students believed HIV can be transmitted
   by drinking from a glass used by an infected person and 22% thought
   mosquito bites spread the virus.  57% believed persons with AIDS can be
   detected by their physical appearance and 38% considered AIDS to be a
   treatable disease.  The most popular sources of knowledge were textbooks
   (51%), television (50%), and newspapers (34%).  Urban students were
   significantly more informed about AIDS than their rural counterparts. 
   Since textbooks are an important source of information in this
   population, it is recommended that the current paragraph on AIDS be
   expanded to a separate chapter on AIDS and other sexually transmitted
   diseases.  In addition, state medical officers are urged to deliver
   talks on AIDS during routine school health examinations.

AB Efforts to prevent adolescent substance abuse often direct prevention efforts at known correlates of substance use. The applicability to minority populations of risk factors uncovered for the general population has been questioned, and the development of different programs targeting the risk factors most salient for different groups has been recommended. Such differentiated programming requires a more precise understanding of ethnic differences in the predictors of substance use than is now available. This article assesses these differences using data from 981 Black and White male and female adolescents and latent variable structural equations techniques. No group differences were observed in the prediction of past year variety of drug use for 9 of the 12 risk factors examined. The predictive validity was higher for Whites than for Blacks for 3 risk factors. The prediction of frequency of use was weaker for Black women than for other groups. The low predictive validity observed for Black women is most likely due to the extremely low level of use among this group. The study concludes that the measures of risk factors predict substance use for all groups examined but that extremely rare behaviors are not well predicted.

AB Cross-sectional associations between self-reported hours of television (TV) viewing per day and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in a biracial (black and white) study population of 4280 men and women, ages 23 to 35 years, undergoing the year-5 follow-up examination for the Cardiovascular Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study in 1990 to 1991. Number of hours of TV viewing per day was higher in blacks than in whites and was inversely associated with education and income. Relative to "light" TV viewers (0 to 1 h/d), "heavy" TV viewers (> or = 4 h/d) had a higher prevalence (P < 0.05) of obesity, smoking, and high hostility score in all race/gender groups, and of physical inactivity in all groups except black men. Among whites, "heavy" TV viewers had higher depression scores, and among blacks, reported more alcohol use. TV viewing was not associated with hypertension and lipid abnormalities. Heavy TV viewing is a modifiable behavior that is associated with increased prevalence of several cardiovascular risk factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: We compared the impact of the Federal Alcoholic Beverage Warning Label on multiparae (women with at least one previous live birth) and nulliparae (women with no previous live births). The label, implemented on November 18, 1989, urges women not to drink during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. If multiparae drank during prior pregnancies, delivering apparently normal babies, we hypothesized that the warning might be less salient for them.; METHOD: We studied 17,456 inner city black gravidas seen between September 1986 and September 1993 at one antenatal clinic. Time series analysis (ARIMA) examined trends in monthly means of antenatal drinking scores (alcohol consumption adjusted for weeks' gestation, age, parity and periconceptional drinking).; RESULTS: For nulliparae (n = 7,349), reported drinking began to show a significant decline in June 1990, 7 months after the implementation of the warning label (t = 2.00, p < .04). In contrast, multiparae (n = 10,107) showed no change in reported drinking (t = 1.23) postlabel.; CONCLUSIONS: Given previous results that multiparae drink more and that heavier drinkers are ignoring the warning label, these data are very distressing and suggests the importance of targeting multiparae for intensive prevention efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: This paper describes the results of an AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors survey of a random sample of heterosexual California adults.; METHODS: The study was conducted from August 1990 until February 1991 and consisted of telephone interviews conducted in English and Spanish, with a household probability sample of 3,545 California adults, undersampling those age 44 and older.; RESULTS: Approximately one-third of the sample believed that HIV/AIDS is contracted by donating blood, and 20% believed the infection could result from insect bites. Tolerance toward HIV-infected persons was highest among young, male, white, employed individuals with higher levels of education and income. Twenty-seven percent of males and 14% of females were categorized as high risk based on the presence of at least 1 of 7 risk factors. High-risk respondents tended to be male, young, employed, never married, U.S. born, and English speaking. Compared to low-risk respondents, they were less likely to use condoms and more likely to use alcohol and drugs in conjunction with sex. Most common sources of AIDS information were television, newspapers, and magazines.; CONCLUSIONS: More strenuous efforts are needed to reach young adults, especially those beyond college age, with AIDS prevention messages. Creative messages via popular media venues should be explored.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to document associations among problem behaviors in childhood and early adolescence and several health risk behaviors in middle adolescence, including a cumulative index of sexual intercourse risk.; METHOD: A nontreatment sample of 1167 10th and 11th grade students was recruited from three homogeneous suburban high schools in western New York. Intercourse activity and number of sexual partners were assessed four times at 6-month intervals over a 2-year period via self-report questionnaires administered in classroom settings.; RESULTS: Sexual intercourse activity, once initiated, was found to be relatively persistent, rather than sporadic, for most adolescents. Repeated intercourse experience with multiple partners over the assessed time periods was associated with higher levels of externalizing childhood behavior problems, earlier onset of antisocial behaviors and substance use, and higher concurrent substance use. An avoidant, withdrawn behavioral style in childhood was associated with lower rates of sexual involvement in adolescence.; CONCLUSIONS: Temporal linkages among childhood precursors and adolescent sexual behaviors were identified as critical to understanding adolescent risk behaviors. These cross-time relationships may identify potential targets for future intervention/prevention efforts among high risk subsamples of children and adolescents.

AB To determine whether self-reported risk and protective behaviors, expectations, and attitudes are more similar among African-American early adolescents within a community-based friendship group than across groups, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 382 African-American youth 9 through 15 years of age forming 76 community-based groups of 3 through 10 same-gender friends. Each member of the friendship group reported his/her own past involvement in nine risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, substance abuse, drug-trafficking, and other delinquent activities) and two protective behaviors (high academic performance and regular church attendance) and their expectations and feelings regarding several of these behaviors. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated overall and by gender and age. Members were generally more similar within friendship groups than across groups with regard to several risk behaviors and expectations including sexual intercourse and drug-trafficking. Particularly striking was the similarity among members of "junior" friendship groups (e.g., median age of youth < 11 years) of both risk and protective behaviors and expectations. The finding of enhanced similarity of risk behaviors and expectations among members within groups suggests that intervention delivery through community-based friendship groups may be a useful approach for risk prevention efforts targeting pre-adolescent African-American youth living in low-income settings.

AB Suicidal behavior and its relationship with other mental disturbances was assessed in an epidemiological study of 1937 Swiss adolescents aged 14 to 19 years. During the most recent 12 months, 27.5% of the females and 16.1% of the males reported suicidal ideation, while 3.3% of the girls and 1.0% of the boys reported suicidal ideation. Suicidality was significantly correlated with physical and mental impairment, alcohol and drug abuse. Of the total epidemiological sample, 475 students (24.5%) were reassessed 12 and 18 months later. Of this follow-up sample, 37 females (12.4%) and 10 males (5.6%) described suicidal ideation as a continuing problem. They revealed significantly more psychiatric symptoms than nonpersistent ideators. Three girls (1.0%) and one boy (0.6%) reported suicide attempts during the follow-up period of 18 months. Only one out of six of the ideators of both sexes received psychiatric treatment. The findings indicate that transient suicidal ideation is common in adolescents. Persistent suicidal behavior appears to be a sign of severe social and psychological disturbances and is associated with serious physical and mental impairment. There is a high risk of completed suicide for youths who demonstrate persistent suicidal ideation, and far more substantial prevention efforts should be designed and implemented to address the circumstances of these youths.

AB The pervasiveness of American youth's exposure to alcohol advertising is well-documented, as is the correlational evidence linking such exposure to alcohol-related attitudes, use, and expectancies. While efforts to train young people to resist persuasive appeals are often made in alcohol education programs, little evidence exists concerning the effectiveness of such efforts. The present study (N = 83) found that recency of exposure to alcohol education classes and discussion of alcohol advertising in such classes predicts cognitive resistance (counterarguing) of such advertisements months or even years after class exposure. Age, gender, and ethnicity were statistically controlled. While females tended to counterargue the alcohol advertisements more than did males, there was no statistically significant difference in the impact of education on males and females.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although adolescent alcohol use has been consistently associated with parental drinking behavior, sibling drinking behavior and family functioning, the extent to which these associations owe to genetic or shared environmental influences has not been previously investigated. Using an adoption study design, we sought to determine whether the familial correlates of adolescent alcohol involvement were due to common genetic or common environmental effects.; METHOD: The sample consisted of 653 adopted families ascertained through adoption agencies in four U.S. states. Each family consisted of a target adopted adolescent, an adoptive mother and an adoptive father. In addition, 68 birth adolescents (i.e., biological offspring of the adoptive parents) and 187 second adopted adolescents from these families participated in the study. All participants completed a mail survey that included assessment of drinking behavior and family functioning.; RESULTS: The relationship between parental problem drinking and adolescent alcohol involvement was moderate and significant among birth offspring (corrected multiple correlation, Rc = .30), but small and non-significant among adoptive offspring (Rc = .00). The relationship between adolescent alcohol involvement and family functioning was substantial for birth offspring (Rc = .39), but only modest for adoptive offspring (Rc = .16). The nonbiological sibling correlation for involvement with alcohol was significant (r = .24) and moderated by sibling pair demographic similarity, such that same-sex, similar-age siblings were substantially more similar (r = .45) than opposite-sex, dissimilar-aged siblings (r = .01).; CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that adolescent alcohol use is affected minimally by the environmental consequences of parent problem drinking and family functioning, but substantially by sibling environmental effects.

AB OBJECTIVE: Resemblances between parents and children for alcohol use can be due both to cultural transmission and genetic inheritance. We examined the genetic and environmental determinants of the familial resemblances in alcohol use.; METHOD: With a parent-twin design a distinction was made between the contribution of genetic effects, the environmental influences shared by siblings and the effects of cultural transmission from parents to offspring. By questionnaire data on whether subjects had ever used alcohol were obtained from 403 Dutch families with a twin aged 15-16 years old and from 805 families with a twin aged 17 years and older.; RESULTS: For 15-16 year olds, the resemblance between parents and offspring could be explained either by genetic inheritance or cultural transmission. Shared environment explained between 58% and 88% of the individual differences in adolescent alcohol use. For twins aged 17 years and older, 43% of the individual differences in alcohol use could be attributed to genetic factors and 37% to shared environment. There was no evidence for cultural transmission in this age group.; CONCLUSIONS: For adolescents aged 17 years and older parental alcohol use did not create an environment that stimulated alcohol use in children. The resemblance for alcohol use between parents and their children aged 17 years and older could be explained by their genetic relatedness. For 15-16 year old adolescents, shared environmental influences were more important than for older adolescents. Only 10% of this shared environmental variance might be influenced by parental alcohol use due to cultural transmission.

AB Distilled spirits are the major source of ethanol consumption in Poland. Such concentrated alcohol is drunk quickly, especially in teenager groups who consider consumption of 250 or 500 ml of vodka during one hour or one hour and half as quite normal. For two years the New Years Eve party has been celebrated in the Main Market Square in Krakow. In 1995 unfavourable weather conditions had been observed for at least 14 days before the New Year's Eve night. During that night only 15 people-participants of the party were admitted to the Department of Toxicology. The aim of this study is to present the cases of poisoned people with ethanol during the last night of the year 1995. All the patients were young (10 poisoned patients were below 17 years of age), considerably low body temperature, and relatively low coma grade. 80% of the patients were admitted between 0:00 and 5:00 a.m. after 200 minutes since the moment they started to drink alcohol. Blood ethanol concentration ranged from 1.2 to 4.23 g/L and serum osmolality from 338 to 440 mOsm/kg H2O. Both ethanol concentration and serum osmolality progressively rose reaching the highest values in the group of patient with III coma degree (p < 0.001). All the cases of acute ethanol poisoning presented in the study had a good outcome, as patient were admitted at the Clinic in relatively short time after symptoms of poisoning have occurred.

College-based prevention programs employed a range of programmatic goals, prevention communication channels, and prevention strategies within a centralized department for drug use prevention. Most program coordinators reported no perceived change in alcohol, tobacco and other drug use, alcohol/drug-related problems, faculty/staff drug use, and alcohol and drug-related crime resulting from prevention efforts on campus. The level of prevention activity differed across institutional type.

AB Using data from a French national survey, preventive and dietary habits, alcohol and smoking consumption of three groups of migrants (Italy, Spain and Portugal, Maghreb) were compared to those of French nationals. Odds ratios were estimated using a logistic regression, after adjustment by age, socio-professional group and place of residence. Differences in attitude were observed, in particular: lower primary and secondary practice of prevention; lower consumption of meat and dairy products and higher consumption of starchy food and dried vegetables; lower consumption of alcohol and higher tobacco intake among Maghrebian migrants. The observed differences were interpreted in the light of other available data in France. They confirm notably imported dietary habits and a weaker perception of preventive messages, as shown in other studies.

The development during the last five years shows an increase, especially in the largest city in the county. The drug addicts have several problems, and several of them were well-known in the social welfare system or by the police. Half of the drug addicts had received treatment for their abuse and three persons were receiving treatment at the time of their death. A few--primarily among the youngest--had only used drugs for a short time while one third had abused drugs for several years. The greater part of the deaths were caused by heroin, which is found in different concentrations in the illegal market. Five of the dead persons had just been released from prison and three people had just left 24-hour care centres when they were found dead. Co-operation between the various, treating authorities has to be given a high priority.
