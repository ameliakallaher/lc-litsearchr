AB American Indians, especially those residing in the Northern Plains, experience considerable preventable morbidity and mortality from alcohol-related motor vehicle events. Research focusing on unintentional injuries associated with drinking drivers has disregarded the epidemiology of their passengers, who are equally at risk. The purpose of this investigation was to define the prevalence of motor vehicle passengers riding with drivers who have been drinking on a Northern Plains Reservation. We surveyed a sample of 151 Northern Plains Indians about their experiences riding with drinking drivers. Associated behavioral and demographic risk factors were also examined to identify possible predictor variables. The majority (54%) of respondents reported riding with a driver who had been drinking at least once during the previous three months. Most often, passengers ride with a friend who has been drinking, on a weekend night. Injury risk may be compounded because few respondents reported regular seat-belt use. The results off our study suggest the need for immediate comprehensive prevention efforts focusing on motor vehicle passengers.

AB OBJECTIVE: College student survey data were examined to assess the impact of campus levels of heavy episodic drinking on nonheavy episodic drinking college students.; METHOD: Analyses are based on a survey mailed to a random sample of college students at 140 American colleges. A total of 17,592 students (69%) at participating colleges responded. The study defined "heavy" drinking as the consumption of five or more drinks in a row for men and four or more for women, and divided schools into approximately equal categories: lower drinking level schools where 35% or fewer students were heavy drinkers; midlevel schools (36-50% heavy drinkers); and high drinking level schools where over 50% of the students were heavy drinkers.; RESULTS: Residing on campus at high drinking level schools adversely affected students who were not engaging in heavy drinking. The odds of experiencing at least one problem from other students' drinking was 3.6 to 1 when nonheavy drinking students at high drinking level schools were compared to nonheavy drinking students at lower drinking level schools. Examples of such secondary heavy drinking effects included being hit or assaulted, having one's property damaged or experiencing an unwanted sexual advance.; CONCLUSIONS: College alcohol prevention efforts should include a focus on the needs of students who are not engaging in heavy drinking yet may be adversely impacted by other students' heavy drinking.

AB This survey examined the relationships of sexual risk taking to substance use and AIDS knowledge in pregnant adolescents (n = 58) and nonpregnant young mothers (n = 93). Subjects were from predominantly minority backgrounds, were single, and ranged in age from 12 to 20 years (M = 16.64). A number of high-risk behaviors were reported, including substance use during pregnancy and early parenthood, unprotected sexual relations, and multiple (lifetime) sex partners. Current pregnancy status, history of marijuana use, and ethnicity were strong predictors of having had multiple sex partners. Odds ratios suggested that Black adolescents were many times more likely than Whites to have had multiple sex partners. Pregnant adolescents were less likely than young mothers (nonpregnant) to have had multiple sex partners but more likely to have unprotected sex (i.e., without use of a condom). Conversely, young mothers were more likely to have multiple sex partners and less likely to have unprotected sex than were pregnant adolescents. Those with a history of marijuana use were more likely to have had multiple sex partners than were adolescents who had never used this drug. AIDS knowledge was not a significant predictor of high-risk sexual behavior. 
A2 To facilitate acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention
   efforts, the relationships between sexual risk taking and both substance
   use and knowledge of AIDS were investigated in a sample of 58 pregnant
   adolescents and 93 teen mothers.  The two major sexual risk-taking
   behaviors reported by subjects were sex without a condom (69% rate at
   last intercourse) and a history of multiple sex partners (average, 3.2
   partners).  77% of teens had used alcohol and 60% had tried marijuana;
   current use rates were 41% and 23%, respectively.  Significant
   predictors of a history of more than one sexual partner included current
   pregnancy, Black race, and history of marijuana use; these three
   variables explained 78% of cases.  For unprotected intercourse, the only
   significant risk factor was current pregnancy (61% of cases).  AIDS
   knowledge did not decrease the likelihood of engaging in either
   high-risk behavior.  Compared to teen mothers, pregnant adolescents were
   less likely to have had multiple sex partners but more likely to have
   had unprotected intercourse.  These findings provide support for the
   theory of problem-proneness behavior, which asserts that those who
   engage in one high-risk behavior (e.g., initiating sex at an early age)
   are likely to engage in other, ecologically linked behaviors (e.g.,
   marijuana use).  Interventions suggested by these results include
   stopping the progression of substance use (alcohol to marijuana to
   cocaine) among young mothers before experimentation with intravenous
   drugs occurs, social cognitive programs addressing hedonistic concerns
   about condom use, and education about the dangers of transmission of the
   AIDS virus to both mother and unborn child associated with unprotected
   sex during pregnancy.

AB This paper reports a risk function analysis of average daily volume of alcohol consumed and the frequency of consuming 5 or more drinks during a single day with reporting an injury in a probability sample of the U.S. adult household population living in the 48 contiguous states. The data are from the 1990 National Alcohol Survey on a weighted sample of 1150 respondents, 748 of whom were current drinkers. Risk of injury was found to increase with an average daily volume of 1 drink for both males and females and for those 30 and younger and those over 30, and to increase with a frequency of consuming 5 or more drinks on one day more often than twice a year. These data suggest that risk for injury may be increased at relatively low levels of consumption and, if so, that preventive efforts aimed at more moderate drinkers may have a greater impact on the reduction of alcohol-related accidents than efforts focused on heavier drinkers who are fewer in number.

AB Actions to prevent injury may address either individual behaviour or population practice. Factors associated with injuries in a variety of circumstances may be best suited to prevention at the level of population whereas more specific causes would not be. Data from the Ontario Health Survey were used to assess the similarities and differences between risk factors and injury in traffic crashes, at work and in other circumstances. Respondents reporting injury were compared with age- and sex-matched controls reporting no injury for reported alcohol ingestion, binge drinking and drinking and driving. In addition, data on the use of licit and illicit drugs, occupation and other demographic factors were compared. Variables showing consistent associations with injury included drug use, some measures of alcohol ingestion and reports of co-existing chronic disease. Many variables showed a variable pattern, including occupation, education and income. In many instances, these differences reflected differences in exposure to risk. Efforts at prevention related to alcohol or medication could be broadly based, whereas for other factors, more targeted prevention efforts would be appropriate.

AB BACKGROUND: The paper is concerned with the use of epidemiological methods to measure the rates at which different strata of a defined population participate in community health promotion projects. The specific aim was to estimate the incidence rates of participation in projects sponsored by the Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation (Healthway), separately for sociodemographic and health-related behavioural subgroups.; METHODS: Data were drawn from Healthway sponsorship projects in 1992. Each sport, arts and racing project was associated with promotion of a health message and creation of a health promoting environment. The study used a two-stage sampling design. Thirteen of 57 large sponsorship projects and 30 of 129 small projects were selected. In the second stage, respondents were randomly surveyed from among project participants. A total of 4060 respondents aged > or = 10 years was sampled from the 43 selected projects. Population-based incident participants were estimated and were related to person-years at risk.; RESULTS: The total participation rate was 4.01 per person-year. The rate was very high at ages 10-14 years and thereafter declined with increasing age. Compared with the least socially disadvantaged 25% of population, the participation rate fell by around one-third in the medium and high disadvantage groups, but exceeded the baseline by a ratio of 1.85 (95% confidence interval: 1.57-2.18) in the most disadvantaged 10% of population. The effect was most pronounced at ages 10-19 years. Participation was higher in those who smoked, drank alcohol unsafely, reported sunburn and reported low consumption of fruit and vegetables. However, participation was reduced in people who were sedentary.; CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological methods can be used to evaluate the distribution of participation of a population in community health promotion projects. The Western Australian Health Promotion Foundation has been successful in reaching disadvantaged youth.

AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize female suicides (n = 19) in an unselected nationwide youth suicide population aged 13 to 22 years (n = 116) and to compare them with male suicides with respect to variables indicating psychopathology and psychosocial functioning.; METHOD: The data were collected in a psychological autopsy study of all suicides (N = 1,397) in Finland during a 12-month period. Data collection included interviews of next of kin and professionals and information from records after the suicide.; RESULTS: Two thirds (68%) of the female victims had suffered from a mood disorder, and 73% had communicated their suicidal intent. Half (47%) of the female subjects had been in psychiatric care at some point in their lives, and 42% had been hospitalized. Compared with young male suicides, the young female victims more often had made previous suicide attempts (63% versus 30%), received more often a diagnosis of major depression (37% versus 14%), and had more often been in psychiatric care (47% versus 21%) during the year preceding the suicide. The females were more often incapable of working, and their psychosocial impairment was more severe during the final week. Alcohol abuse was almost as common among the female as the male victims (21% versus 26%).; CONCLUSION: The results suggest that young females who commit suicide may have suffered from more severe psychopathology than young male victims. Substance abuse seems to be a major factor also in female suicides. Preventive efforts within psychiatric care are likely to reach a higher proportion of the young females than males at high risk for suicide.

AB Factors related to drinking habits among 663 adolescents 14, 15, 17 and 18 years old were investigated in three municipalities by means of a questionnaire. In a multiple regression analysis, variation in alcohol consumption was examined using several independent variables describing access to alcohol, behavioural factors, environmental influences, attitudes and demographic background. The most important factors predicting high alcohol consumption were early drinking debut, being away from home at night without the parents' knowledge, having friends who drink a lot and early high consumption of unhealthy foods such as soft drinks, peanuts and chips. All these factors were again related to upbringing and home environment.

AB OBJECTIVE: This article reports a longitudinal study of drinking patterns among whites, blacks and Hispanics between 1984 and 1992.; METHOD: A probability sample including 1,777 whites, 1,947 blacks and 1,453 Hispanics in the U.S. adult household population was interviewed in 1984. In 1992 a subsample consisting of 788 whites, 723 blacks and 703 Hispanics was reinterviewed. Interviews averaging 1 hour in length were conducted in respondents' home by trained interviewers.; RESULTS: Abstention increased in all groups with the exception of Hispanic women, among whom it remained stable. Heavy drinking decreased only among white men (from 19% to 12%). Among men, the incidence of heavy drinking was 7% among whites, 10% among blacks and 17% among Hispanics. The stability of heavy drinking was greater among black (51%) and Hispanic men (43%) than among white men (32%). The best predictor of drinking in 1992 was drinking in 1984.; CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in heavy drinking observed among whites were not observed among blacks and Hispanics. The greater stability of heavy drinking in the minority groups helps to explain higher rates of problems reported in the literature for these two groups. Prevention efforts targeting drinking and heavy drinking among blacks and Hispanics must be renewed and intensified.

AB BACKGROUND: Exposure to tobacco and alcohol advertising has been associated with adolescent substance use. However, it is not clear whether favorable reactions to advertising are an antecedent to or a consequence of substance use. This study investigated relationships between adolescents' levels of susceptibility to substance use and their recognition and liking of tobacco and alcohol advertising.; METHOD: Eighth-grade students viewed pictures of tobacco and alcohol advertisements with brand names and identifying information obscured, attempted to identify the brand name and type of product being advertised, and rated their liking of the advertisements. Subjects were divided into three substance use status groups: nonsusceptible nonusers (have never used and do not intend to do so), susceptible nonusers (have not used but have not made a firm commitment not to experiment in the future), and users (have tried the substance).; RESULTS: Susceptible nonusers liked the tobacco advertisements at a level that was significantly greater than that of the nonsusceptible nonsmokers and comparable to that of the users. Liking of the alcohol advertisements generally increased with alcohol use status.; CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that tobacco advertisements ostensibly targeted to adult smokers may have the effect of recruiting new adolescent smokers.

AB OBJECTIVES: To date, HIV spread in China has occurred principally among injecting drug users (IDU) in remote border regions of Yunnan province. We therefore sought to better understand the risks for and prevalence of HIV infection among drug users in parts of China outside Yunnan province.; METHODS: A behavioral survey of drug use and AIDS-related knowledge was conducted among all consenting drug users who entered treatment from 1 November to 31 December 1993 in seven provincial drug detoxification centers outside Yunnan province. After giving verbal informed consent, all drug users were tested for HIV.; RESULTS: Of the 1293 study participants, 207 (16%) reported injecting drugs. The proportion of IDU among all drug users varied widely by region, from 1% in Sha'anxi and Gansu provinces in the northwest region to 58% in Guangxi province in the south. IDU were more likely than non-IDU to be single and unemployed or self-employed, but did not differ in other demographic aspects. Among all drug users, 2% reported sharing needles without cleaning equipment, while 5% shared with some cleaning. Although 1060 (82%) drug users had heard of AIDS and most knew about its sexual (79%), parenteral (77%), and perinatal (60%) modes of transmission, many had misconceptions about its spread by casual contact. Of the 207 IDU tested for HIV, none were HIV-positive (95% confidence interval, 0--1.4).; CONCLUSION: The absence of HIV infections detected in this study suggests that the prevalence of HIV is currently low among IDU in China outside the Yunnan province. However, the behavior of these IDU puts them at high risk for HIV infection. Prevention efforts are needed to prevent the spread of HIV among IDU throughout China and to avoid the experience of neighboring countries in Asia. 
A2 Representatives of the World Bank (RWB) claim that a published argument
   linking some of their policies to the development of a situation which
   fosters the spread of AIDS can be summarized as claiming that "economic
   development is bad because it facilitates the spread of communicable
   disease by bringing people into closer and more frequent contact."  The
   RWB acknowledge that economic development facilitates the spread of
   infection but defend economic development because it also provides the
   knowledge and means to combat disease.  The RWB claim that the logical
   conclusion of the alternative development strategy proposed by their
   critics would mean a return to the stone age.  The RWB further accuse
   their critics of ignoring evidence that countries undergoing structural
   adjustment have achieved faster economic growth, a reduction in poverty,
   and an increase in health spending.  The critics are charged with
   failing to ask whether the criticisms leveled at the World Bank's
   treatment of AIDS as a public health priority are valid, with failing to
   point out that the labor migration in south Africa which incubated AIDS
   is older than structural adjustment, and with failure to note that
   Brazil's avoidance of economic equilibrium during the 1980s impoverished
   the country.  Finally, the RWB charged that their critics disregard
   economics, public health, and the scientific method in their attempt to
   make AIDS the only thing that matters.

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe 'dry sex' practices intended to decrease vaginal secretions and to determine whether these practices are related to HIV infection.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in a teaching hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. The subjects comprised 329 women aged 15-50 years presenting consecutively for an initial evaluation of sexually transmitted disease symptoms. Dry sex practices were assessed by questionnaire, and serological testing for HIV antibodies was performed.; RESULTS: Fifty percent of women had engaged in at least one dry sex practice. The most common practices were drinking 'porridge' (a liquid or suspension believed to cause drying of the vagina; 28%), removing vaginal secretions with a cloth (22%) and placing leaves in the vagina (11%). The most frequent reasons given for drinking porridge were to increase the partner's sexual enjoyment and to tighten the vagina, while cleaning the vagina was mentioned often by those using cloth or leaves. Swelling or peeling of the vagina was reported by approximately 10% of women using cloth or leaves. Overall, the HIV seroprevalence in the sample was 58%. In bivariate analysis, no practice was statistically significantly associated with HIV infection. Multiple logistic regression had little impact on these findings.; CONCLUSIONS: Although a variety of practices with potential relevance to HIV transmission were reported, there was no evidence in this study population of a strong relationship between these practices and HIV infection. Women should be counseled about the potential risks of these practices, but prevention efforts should continue to emphasize measures of known effectiveness, particularly limiting the numbers of sexual partners, consistently using condoms and obtaining appropriate treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.

Correlations between scores on the CBCL scales for 99 pairs of monozygotic twins and 82 pairs of dizygotic twins indicated significant genetic influences that varied according to the specific area of competence and problem behavior. Model-fitting estimates derived from multiple regression analyses indicated significant genetic influence on competence in school and on all areas of problem behavior. In addition, significant shared environmental influence was detected for amount and quality of participation in activities, quality of social relationships, performance in school, anxiety/depression, and delinquent behaviour. Implications for future work on the mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: This study was a first initiative to evaluate the application of social marketing theory (SMT) to increase attendance at an alcohol abuse education program for university residence hall students and to ascertain whether aggressive recruitment strategies are necessary as part of the stepped approach model (SAM) of service delivery.; METHOD: SMT and public health strategies that include focus groups, in-depth interviews, and intercept interviews were used to develop recruitment materials in a Test Hall. These new recruitment materials were introduced to the residents in the Treatment Hall (N = 727) and were compared to the Usual Care, Control Hall (N = 706) which received the recruitment materials normally provided to residents as well as to three Historical Halls separately and combined which had used the Usual Care recruitment materials in the past.; RESULTS: The Treatment Hall percentage attendance was significantly superior (0.001 < p < 0.05) in all comparisons. The percentage attendance did not differ significantly from marketing literature expectations. The projections for campus-wide attendance for residence hall students were between 207 and 243 participants and for nationwide attendance, 36,900 +/- 8,185.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the SMT and public health methods used are helpful in developing recruitment strategies and are an important initial step of the SAM and that a "minimal intervention" recruitment strategy is a cost-effective approach that can have a dramatic impact.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the attitudes about adolescent health issues, especially school-based health services, held by adults in a rural community.; DESIGN: "Before-after," quasi-experimental design involving independent, cross-sectional population-based surveys in 1989 and 1992.; SETTING: Rural county located in the southeastern United States.; PARTICIPANTS: Probability sample of adults, 18 years and older, who were residents of the county, including 831 respondents in the first survey and 210 respondents in the second survey.; INTERVENTION: County-wide public education campaign involving public service announcements on television and radio, newspaper advertisements, posters, and open-to-the-public adolescent health programs and events.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attitudes about the types of health services that should be included in a public school-based adolescent health program.; RESULTS: Rural adults' attitudes toward public school-based adolescent health services were similar before and after the community-wide campaign. Respondents believed the public schools should provide teenagers with information and counseling on substance abuse, sexual activity, birth control, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but should not provide primary health care or birth control products. Most adults believed that sex and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome education should begin before high school.; CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive, public school-based adolescent health program providing health information but not health services may be acceptable to this community. Adults' attitudes about adolescent health issues do not appear to have been modified by the adolescent health awareness campaign.

AB BACKGROUND: Young people in school are at an impressionable age, peer pressures are intense, and the probability that they will pick up a high-risk behavior, such as smoking, is high. The key to reduction of smoking among adults is to target our prevention efforts at young adults and teens.; OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and trend of smoking among young adults and teens and to formulate guidelines on smoking reduction to guide those who counsel young people.; STUDY DESIGN: The study design is cross sectional.; METHODS: This study is based on the data from the Oklahoma Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System - the two systems that monitor the prevalence of behaviors that most influence health.; RESULTS: The prevalence of smoking among young adults (age 18-24) in Oklahoma is high at more than 21%. The disturbing feature is that it is higher among young females than among young males. The prevalence of smoking among young adults is the highest among high school dropouts and is more than 38%. It is lower among high school graduates (about 28%) and lowest among college graduates (about 18%). The percentage of smoking among students who classify themselves as current smokers rises from 23% to 30% as the students progress from grade 9 to 12 and the percentage of frequent smokers increases from 8% to 16%.; CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines suggested for counselors are: 1. Along with smoking, look for comorbid behaviors such as alcohol use, drug abuse, and high-risk sexual behavior. 2. Ask whether the student has easy access to free cigarette samples. 3. Check whether the teen is trying to lose weight; suggest appropriate methods for losing weight if smoking is being used for losing weight. 4. Target health education efforts early in a student's school career starting in elementary school, but concentrate especially at the 8th or 9th grade level to have maximum preventive impact.

AB Bladderdysfunction seems to have an increasing frequency in infancy, and especially in children without obvious congenital organic or functional bladderdysfunction. The disorder seems is related with changes in our behaviour, that are stimulated by familial and social pseudo-reasons. Commercial interests and marketing play a major role. This leads to wrong dry-training, an exaggerated hygienic education, prudisheness, wrong toilet-posture, lack of time to void, post-poning, wrong drink- and void-pattern, wrong food-pattern and increasing constipation. Prevention is necessary by an adapted reeducation of parents ans society.

AB The proportion of total reported cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in US women increased annually between 1988 and 1994 from 10% to 18%, indicating an urgent need for prevention measures. Interventions designed to reduce unsafe sex and drug-using behaviors in women have been limited. Barriers to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention for women include a disproportionately low investment of resources, inadequacy and inaccessibility of substance abuse treatment programs, the crack/cocaine epidemic and resulting unsafe sex behaviors, lack of a woman-controlled method to prevent sexual transmission of HIV, and unique social and cultural factors that limit women's power in sexual decision making. Some interventions have been successful in reducing women's risk behaviors. Expanding prevention efforts targeted to women is necessary in order to stem the rising rate of HIV infection.

AB Young adult alcohol problems based on DIS/DSM III diagnoses were predicted from a number of adolescent risky/antisocial behaviors in a sample of 693 subjects. The number of times an individual was intoxicated before his/her sixteenth birthday was the best indicator of adult alcohol "abuse" and /or dependence, with adolescent fighting, arrests, and lack of participation in religious activities also serving as important problem behavior predictors. Results of correlational and principal-components analyses of adolescent problem behaviors are similar to previous work on Problem Behavior Theory. The results suggest that prevention efforts should begin before adolescence, prior to the time when individuals are exposed to, or begin practicing, adult health-threatening activities.

AB To describe characteristics of persons with late (at or after death) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis, we analyzed national surveillance data among all persons with AIDS diagnosed through December 1991 under the pre-1993 AIDS case definition and with a known date of death. Late diagnosis was present in 15.8% of 163,202 decreased persons with AIDS and in 15.3% of decreased men with AIDS, 20.6% of women, 12.1% of whites, 20.0% of blacks, 21.1% of Hispanics, 12.3% of men who have sex with men (MSM), 21.9% of injecting drug users (IDU), and 19.6% of persons exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through heterosexual contact. When age, race/ethnicity, sex, geographic region, and transmission mode were included in logistic regression analyses, among adults/adolescents, late diagnosis was more likely among persons 40 years or older than among those 13-39 years old, among blacks and Hispanics than among whites, and among IDU and persons exposed to HIV through heterosexual contact than among MSM. Although children (less than 13 years of age) were more likely to have late diagnosis than adults and adolescents, late diagnoses among children did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity, sex, geographic region, or transmission mode. Late AIDS diagnosis, especially among ethnic minorities and IDU and their sex partners, may represent delays in HIV diagnosis and care. In addition to not receiving early clinical intervention, persons who are diagnosed later in the course of HIV disease represent missed opportunities for receiving prevention efforts such as education, counseling, and substance abuse treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB In contrast to the extensive research effort to understand the genetic contribution to alcoholism risk, there has been little research directed at understanding genetic influences on smoking behavior. Data from large twin studies in Scandinavia and Australia are consistent with a major genetic influence on the probability that an individual will become a smoker ("initiation") and will persist in the smoking habit once smoking has started ("persistence"). We use data from the 1988/1989 follow-up survey of the Australian NH&MRC twin panel to determine to what degree personality measures (Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire--Revised) and attitudinal and sociodemographic variables (social and political conservatism, education, religious involvement) might account for genetic or environmental influences on smoking. While we find significant phenotypic associations between these variables and smoking, these are too modest to account for much of the genetic variance. Possible mechanisms by which this genetic variance may arise are discussed.

The results are compared with those of a similar study in the United States. We also review alcohol advertisements on television and the drinking scenes shown in comics. On the average, Japanese magazines tend to contain fewer alcohol advertisements than American magazines. However, 18 (53%) in 34 weekly magazines contained alcohol advertisements showing that such magazines are an important medium for alcoholic beverage advertising in Japan. There were also alcohol advertisements targeting to particular populations, youths and women, which may be connected with the increase in drinking in these groups. Alcohol advertisements in the mass media should be monitored continuously as public health issue.

   improving the quality of life of the Chinese people, protecting the
   environment, controlling population growth, improving health and
   employment, improving public and social security, and promoting national
   solidarity. The Chinese government will look forward to sharing the
   Chinese experiences with social development at the forthcoming UN World
   Summit on Social Development in March, 1995. Since 1980 a national
   program for economic development has been in force. Since 1949 and the
   founding of the People's Republic and particularly since 1978, many
   advances have been made. The Chinese government has been able to provide
   adequate food and clothing for a population comprising 22% of the
   world's population living on 7% of the world's land. Not only have basic
   living standards been met, but per capital disposable income has
   increased. Ownership of durable consumer goods has increased to the
   level of moderately developed countries. Radio messages reach about 80%
   of the population, and television reaches about 83% of the population.
   Family planning programs have promoted a balance among population with
   ecology and socioeconomic development. The rate of natural increase has
   declined from 25.83 in 1970 to 11.45 in 1993. The crude birth rate for
   the same period declined from 33.43 to 18.09. The crude death rate has
   remained at about 6-7 per 1000 population. The total fertility rate has
   been reduced to 2.0. Life expectancy has increased from 65 years to 70
   years. Illiteracy among the population 15 years and older has greater
   improved; the illiteracy rate among youth and adults was 7% in 1993.
   Environmental policies have brought industrial pollution under strict
   control. Sewage treatment plants have been built. Natural gas and
   centralized heating have been promoted. Sound agricultural practices
   have been promoted. Reforestation efforts have resulted in the planting
   of almost 10 billion new trees. 13.9% of land area was forested in 1993.
   600,000 sq km of eroded land has been reclaimed. Natural preserves (776)
   cover 661,800 km. 97.7% of school-age children were enrolled in school

AB Previous research has confirmed the role of problem-behavior theory constructs as predictors of nonconventional behaviors such as adolescent drug abuse. No prospective study, however, has examined this theory's relevance to less extreme nonconventional adolescent behaviors, such as poor health practices. In the present study, an attempt was made to predict an index composed of seven health risk factor items measured in 8th grade from numerous variables measured in 7th grade selected to reflect personality, perceived environment, and behavior systems of problem-behavior theory. In addition, problem-behavior theory was compared in predictive efficacy to a wellness notion. Factor analysis did not support the construct validity of the three systems as measured herein. Instead, resulting empirically derived factors reflected domains labeled "wellness," "subjective distress," and "problem behavior." In addition, linear regression results indicated that constituents of wellness, subjective distress, and problem-behavior domains, as well as the demographic variable of lower socioeconomic status, and taking less care of one's own physical health in 7th grade, were predictors of taking less care of one's physical health the next year. One interpretation of these results is that lack of a sense of wellness may lead one to yield to problem behavior-related social environment influences including participation in poor health practices.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the 3-year developmental course of problem behaviors and competencies in intercountry adoptees in adolescence and to determine the role of ethnicity and early adverse environmental influences on the development of problem behaviors.; METHOD: In this prospective study, a sample of 1,538 intercountry adoptees, aged 11 to 14 years at initial assessment and 14 to 17 years at follow-up, were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at both occasions.; RESULTS: Across the follow-up interval there was an increase in problem behaviors and a decrease in competencies. Increases in problem scores were greatest for the CBCL scales Withdrawn and Delinquent Behavior. These findings contrasted with the results from a longitudinal study of an epidemiological sample of children from the general population. The increase in problem scores could not be attributed to the age of the child at placement, the medical condition at placement, early neglect or abuse, or racial antagonism.; CONCLUSION: In contrast with their agemates from the general population, intercountry adoptees showed an increase in maladaptive functioning in adolescence. Because early adverse influences were not responsible for the increase of problems, it was concluded that other factors pertaining to adolescent development interact negatively with adoption-specific factors that render individuals vulnerable to deviation from the normal developmental pathway.

AB Deficits in social skills have been found to be related to adolescent substance use. Little effort has been devoted to understanding how family factors influence the acquisition of these skills. This study examined the manner in which family disharmony and parental alcohol use affect adolescent alcohol use through their influence on the acquisition of social skills and self-efficacy regarding one's ability to utilize these skills. It was hypothesized that family disharmony and parental alcohol use directly influenced usage and affected usage indirectly through their influence on acquisition of social skills. Social skills were also hypothesized to affect usage directly and to affect usage indirectly by influencing beliefs regarding one's ability to implement these skills. Results indicated that family disharmony was directly related to adolescent alcohol use and social skills. Parental alcohol use was related only to adolescent usages, not to social skills. Social skills were related to self-efficacy, which was related to alcohol use but was not directly related to usage. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of family influences on adolescent alcohol use, the importance of including families in prevention efforts, and the importance of the acquisition of self-efficacy relative to social skills.

AB Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first detected in Costa Rica in 1983. For four years most known cases were in hemophiliac men. Thereafter, AIDS in homosexual and bisexual men predominated. By December 31 of 1993, 563 persons had been diagnosed with the syndrome, 71% of them homosexual and bisexual men, 10% heterosexual men and women, 6% hemophiliacs, 2% intravenous drug abusers (IVDA's), 2% women and men who had blood transfusions, 1.4% infants born to HIV-infected mothers and 7% unknown. The epidemics in homosexual/bisexual men and in heterosexual women and men are rising; cases in infants and in persons who received blood or coagulation factors, are stagnant. The steady increase in AIDS among women is linked to exposure to bisexual partners. The moderate nature of the national epidemic reflects, in part, the low incidence of IVDA, the universal screening of blood donors for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 1985, and the prompt banning of unsafe coagulation factors. The projection of AIDS for the year 2000 is 2,304 cases (606 accumulated incidence per million inhabitants). A national educational campaign, radio and television programs and other preventive actions, apparently did not influence the rate of receptive anal intercourse without condom (about 80%) during 9 years of the epidemic. Persons with HIV/AIDS often are deprived of social and medical benefits or are subjected to harassment and exploitation by the health sector. More efficient prevention must target children, adolescents and adults in reproductive age, to promote safer lifestyles, through education and counseling effected through primary health care.

Data were obtained from a sample of 1,346 students (50.9% males, 49.1% females), who were asked to indicate the amount of information (none, little, much) they had received from ten sources about eight categories of drugs. Among the findings: television is the primary source of information for all drugs, except inhalants, for which newspapers/magazines are the main source. Newspapers/magazines are of secondary importance for the rest of the seven categories of drugs. Teenagers are less likely to receive information from physicians/nurses and relatives than from other sources. Information based on personal experience is prominent concerning alcohol, cigarettes, inhalants and hashish/marijuana, and it prevails more among males than among females (p < .01). Females use school teachers as a source of information in all drug categories more than males (p < .01). There are differences in using various information sources among grades and types of places of living. Information based on personal experience with alcohol is notably correlated with that with cigarettes, whereas information based on personal experience with opiates is correlated with that with stimulants, hallucinogens and hashish/marijuana (p < .001). The mean number of sources of information used by the respondents is the highest concerning alcohol and the lowest concerning depressants. Implications for prevention are discussed.

While the relationship is the same today as it was in the past, the pervasiveness of the association, and the consequences, are more dramatic. There are two ways in which substance abuse is related to violence. First, violence can be and is perpetrated under the influence of substances, and second, violence related to substance abuse stems from the trade in drugs, which is all too often focused in poor and underserved communities. The elimination of the market for drugs, and thus the reduction in the demand for drugs, will bring about a reduction in substance abuse-related violence.

There is a growing body of "wisdom" and research literature that suggests that the most effective role for community coalitions and partnerships in terms of prevention is to build the capacity of community leaders and their institutions to better serve their constituencies. This can be accomplished through the use of the coalition to strengthen the enabling or support system for community initiatives. An enabling system provides a variety of services, including training and consultation, information and referral, networking and local coalition development, communication, incentive grants and recognition, information and social marketing, resource development, and research and evaluation services. This paper also outlines the key internal capacities a coalition will need in order to establish this system.

AB We present a content analysis of 137 public service announcements (PSAs) focused on alcohol-impaired driving that aired nationally on U.S. television between 1987 and 1992. Our findings include the following: 1) Most PSAs were intended to reach an undifferentiated general audience, not necessarily those who are at greatest risk for driving after drinking. 2) Most PSAs were designed to create awareness of the problem of alcohol-impaired driving or to promote individual behavior change. 3) More PSAs were developed on the use of designated drivers than on any other subject. 4) About two-thirds of the PSAs included one or more celebrities who speak directly to the audience. Past media campaigns have tended to ignore the fact that people's behavior is profoundly shaped by their environment, which in turn is shaped by public policy. We recommend that future mass media campaigns against alcohol-impaired driving focus on building support for changes in institutional structures, public policy or law that will motivate, support, and sustain the efforts of individuals to alter their behavior. Television PSAs can play an important but somewhat limited role in support of this effort. Greater emphasis will need to be given instead to media advocacy strategies, including paid radio advertising. We further recommend that the principal organizations concerned about alcohol-impaired driving share their plans and develop a common communications strategy that will advance the public policy agenda proposed by the Surgeon General's Workshop on Drunk Driving.

AB OBJECTIVE: The search for genetic and phenotypic markers associated with future alcoholism risk often centers on comparisons of children of alcoholics and controls. Such studies require large samples to compensate for the rate of expression of alcoholism in less than half of children of alcoholics, the importance of environmental influences, the complex types of inheritance likely to be involved and the lack of precision of many of the measurements used. An additional problem is the change in family history status over time.; METHOD: This study uses personal interviews with subjects and an additional informant during a 9.3-year follow-up of 223 men to demonstrate the impact of the problem of family history misclassification.; RESULTS: On follow-up, 7% of the men who had been originally classified as family history negative (FHN) were found to have a close relative who developed alcoholism during the follow-up period, and another 6% had gained knowledge of a preexisting alcohol use disorder in their relatives during the interval since testing. Also, 5% of the 223 men had originally been identified as sons of alcoholics but were found to have been incorrectly categorized based on more thorough information at follow-up.; CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the conclusion that relatively large samples are required in this research to overcome the minimum of a 7% error rate in family history assignment likely to occur from the future development of alcoholism in the family of family history negative subjects along with additional errors in reporting or interpreting original histories.

AB Sir Harold Stiles has a historic spot in the annals of trauma care to which he and his military colleagues so richly contributed. For this we honour him today. Tremendous progress has been achieved during our lifetime in the field of trauma. Injury prevention has been the most important facet with progress underway in the fields of gun control, seatbelts, motorcycle and bicycle helmets, child restraint seats, airbags and particularly alcohol restraint. Overall, traffic fatalities are being reduced. Of great importance is the need for de-emphasis and deglamorization of violence by television, movie, and news media. Improved prehospital care has taken the form of professionalism of emergency medical services comparable to that in law enforcement and fire services. Improved hospital care is resulting, in part, from the widespread development of trauma and burn centres. Continued progress is needed in each field, particularly in gun control, alcohol control, overall traffic accident prevention, and in the understanding of cerebral oedema after head injury. The teaching of the principles of trauma prevention and community organization for better emergency medical response should be introduced into the Health or Civics curriculum perhaps at the 5th or 6th grade level in elementary schools. Perhaps the greatest potential for progress in the field of trauma which we have witnessed in our lifetime may prove to have been the actions of the United Nations in Korea in 1950 and Kuwait in 1991, proclaiming that 'war will no longer be tolerated as an instrument of national aggression'.

AB We examined the relationship between childhood sexual, physical, psychological, and "multiple" abuse (i.e., abuse in more than one form) and comorbid Axis I and personality psychopathology among women with a lifetime history of bulimia nervosa (BN group; n =s 80) and a control group of noneating-disordered women (n = 40). Subjects were recruited primarily by newspaper advertisement. They participated in structured clinical interviews for diagnosis of Axis I and personality pathology, and they completed child abuse questionnaires in the interview setting. At odds with prediction, child abuse in various forms was not associated with the presence of lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders in general (i.e., 1 or more) or disorder classes in particular (mood, alcohol/substance use, anxiety) among BN subjects, although sexual, psychological, and multiple abuse were associated with the diagnosis of a higher total number of Axis I conditions. A history of psychological and multiple abuse (but not physical or sexual abuse alone) among BN subjects was strongly associated with the presence of personality disorder diagnoses, especially those in the "anxious-fearful" cluster (Cluster C). Finally, we found that when a personality disorder was present in addition to the Axis I conditions in question, significant relationships emerged between abuse and Axis I pathology, particularly for psychological and multiple abuse. In general, control group findings were in accord with BN group findings, indicating that our findings were not specific to eating-disordered women. Our results suggest that childhood abuse, particularly psychological abuse and abuse in multiple forms, increase the likelihood of lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders and personality pathology among bulimic patients. Eating-disordered women with a history of child abuse may thus represent a subgroup of patients requiring especially intensive intervention.

AB A partnership between corporate worksites, a community-based prevention agency, and families in those worksites is described. Its primary goals were the reduction of family risk and enhancement of family protective factors that predispose children and youth to substance abuse and related social and emotional difficulties. A related goal of the program is to reduce family stress levels and attitudes that may influence the parents' levels of risk for substance abuse and related disorder. The program delivery strategy is conceived of as part of the necessart efforts of prevention programs to reach target populations in host settings in which they may naturally participate, thereby reducing obstacles and barriers to participation that often impede prevention efforts. Evaluation revealed that the program was generally better able to retain parents for a fairly lengthy period, and with high rates of attendance. Program attendance was also not affected by parental background characteristics that, in other delivery approaches, are often associated with poor attendance and high drop-out levels. Results also indicated that levels of program exposure (dosage) do make a significant difference in the efficacy of such efforts as those parents in the program who participated in higher percentages and numbers of sessions (i.e. more than 80% of sessions) showed both short-term and longer-term (i.e. across 18 month follow-ups) gains in their ratings of the target child's behavior problems and strengths, substance abuse resistance related knowledge and attitudes, reduced parental stress, depression and irritability, and increased utilization of social support. By contrast, parents who received a low program exposure exhibited a more restricted set of short-term gains. The findings are discussed in terms of their importance for consideration of program dosage for prevention programs, and the need to attend to the context in which programming is offered as it may facilitate or impede efforts to provide levels of dosage and fidelity to create enduring impacts.

AB Data from a longitudinal study carried out in Dunedin, New Zealand, were used to investigate associations between alcohol consumption at age 18 years and alcohol-related mass media communications recalled at ages 13 and 15 years. The respondents' recall of alcohol-related mass media material were categorized as: commercial alcohol advertising, alcohol moderation messages or the portrayal of alcohol in entertainment. An additional media variable was the number of hours spent watching television. Non-media variables, such as peer approval of drinking, living situation and occupation (all at age 18 years) were also included in the analyses. The period between the interviews at ages 13 and 15 years saw an increase in the broadcast of commercial alcohol advertisements on television in New Zealand and this was reflected in an increase in the proportion of the mass media material recalled which was categorized as commercial advertising. At age 15 years television advertising, mostly for beer companies, was the predominant material recalled. No relationships were found between the commercial advertising and wine and spirits consumption, among either men or women, but young women who had watched more hours of television drank more wine/spirits. Among women there were two unexpected negative relationships between recall of alcohol in the media at age 13 years and beer consumption. However, among men there was a consistent positive relationship such that those who had recalled more alcohol advertisements at age 15 years drank larger quantities of beer at age 18 years.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in injecting drug users (IDUs) from central Sydney.; SETTING AND SUBJECTS: All IDUs attending a primary health care facility in central Sydney between December 1991 and November 1992 who underwent HCV antibody testing.; METHODS: Information was obtained retrospectively from client forms routinely completed at the time of medical consultation. Additional information on injecting history and practice was obtained from the registration forms of subjects who also attended the needle syringe exchange programme at the same health care facility.; RESULTS: Of the 201 IDUs tested, 118 (59%) had HCV antibodies, which did not differ significantly between males and females. HCV prevalence increased significantly with age, being highest in IDUs who were aged 35 years or more (93%) and lowest in IDUs aged under 20 years (17%). HCV prevalence increased significantly with time since first injecting, from 26% for IDUs who had injected for less than 3 years to 94% for those who had injected for more than 10 years. HCV prevalence was also significantly higher in heterosexual IDUs as compared with homosexual male IDUs, and in opiate users as compared with stimulant users, even after adjustment for age and duration of injecting. HCV prevalence was strongly associated with exposure to hepatitis B virus, but was not associated with exposure to HIV.; CONCLUSION: Recent HCV transmission indicates ongoing injecting risk behaviour despite HIV prevention efforts, and underlies the potential for increased transmission of HIV through the sharing of injecting equipment. Within the population of IDUs, those who are heterosexual or inject heroin appear to be at increased risk of HCV infection.

AB Recruitment of program participants and development of appealing comprehensive alcohol abuse prevention programs is an exigent priority for university campuses due to the serious physical and emotional consequences related to alcohol consumption. A sample of 67 students from a large midwestern university completed a survey based on Social Marketing Theory (SMT) which was developed to improve recruitment and enhance the design of comprehensive alcohol abuse prevention programs. The results indicate that recruitment may be optimized by providing a flexible, convenient, low-cost program that encourages friends' participation, communicates alcohol-related risks and offers university credit or refund as participation incentives. The design of alcohol abuse prevention programs may be enhanced by emphasizing the positive outcomes of reducing alcohol consumption, improving the quality and quantity of alternatives to the social atmosphere connected with drinking, and soliciting respected opinion leaders (physicians and parents) to communicate alcohol reduction messages. This project is a first initiative to 'fill the gap' in the social marketing research literature by providing formative information pertinent to recruitment and design of alcohol reduction programs specifically for college students.

AB High rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among jail and prison inmates suggest that HIV prevention efforts should focus on incarcerated populations. Overcrowding, the high prevalence of injection drug use, and other high-risk behaviors among inmates create a prime opportunity for public health officials to affect the course of the HIV epidemic if they can remedy these problems. Yet, along with the opportunity, there are certain obstacles that correctional institutions present to public health efforts. The various jurisdictions have differing approaches to HIV prevention and control. Whether testing should be mandatory or voluntary, whether housing should be integrated or segregated by HIV serostatus, and whether condoms, bleach, or clean needles should be made available to the prisoners, are questions hotly debated by public health and correctional officials. Even accurate assessment of risk-taking within the institutions leads to controversy, as asking questions could imply acceptance of the very behaviors correctional officials are trying to prevent. Education and risk-reduction counseling are the least controversial and most widely employed modes of prevention, but the effectiveness of current prevention efforts in reducing HIV transmission in this high-risk population is largely undetermined.

The main drugs involved, in descending order, were: alcohol, tobacco, inhalants (solvents), amphetamines and cannabis. Others included mandrax, tranquilisers, sedatives and the hallucinogen mudzepete. No students reported use of heroin, cocaine, LSD or opium. Drug use increased with age and involved both sexes, the problem being more acute in the urban schools. A differential use pattern is revealed, implying valuable information for targeted prevention efforts.

AB During the last decade, childhood obesity has been on the increase in Singapore and many newly industrialized Asian countries. We compared the mean body mass index (BMI) and triceps skinfold (TSF) values, as well as the dietary and physical activity patterns of Singaporean Chinese and Chinese American youths. Chinese Americans had a higher mean BMI but a lower mean TSF than Singaporean Chinese. Dietary comparisons suggest that Singaporean Chinese ate fish and grain products more often than Chinese American youths, while Chinese American youths consumed processed meats, dairy products and snack foods more frequently. Mean frequency of consumption of low fat, traditional Chinese foods such as rich porridge was higher among the Singaporean Chinese, while typical 'American' foods including cheese were consumed more often among the Chinese Americans. Certain food items that were more 'neutral' in terms of their cultural identity, such as carbonated drinks, cookies and bread were consumed with the same mean frequencies in both cohorts. In terms of physical activity, Singaporean Chinese youths, on average, spent more time in sedentary activities, less time sitting, and more time in light or moderate activities. The mean time spent on vigorous activities per day was only one hour in both cohorts. Our study suggests differences in body fat distribution and composition, as well as in dietary and activity patterns, between Chinese American and Singaporean Chinese youths. There is a need to develop obesity indicators that are appropriate for the specific populations involved, and to carefully investigate environmental influences on childhood obesity.

Snow-ball techniques were used to recruit the largest possible number of participants.; RESULTS: 11 lesbians (6.1%) were found to be HIV-1 antibody positive. Of them, 10 were intravenous (i.v.) drug users. STD episodes were higher among lesbians with HIV-1 than without (p = 0.04), increasing in both groups over time. Syphilis, genital herpes and viral hepatitis were highly associated with HIV-1 (p = 0.000). In univariate analysis, i.v. drug use, bisexual behaviour, history of STDs, sex during menses and vaginal/anal manipulation were significantly linked to HIV-1 (p = 0.000). In multivariate analysis only history of i.v. drug use (p = 0.04) and bisexual behaviour (p = 0.06) remained independently associated with HIV-1. Seventy-one participants (39.3%) had already undergone AIDS testing. Only 3.5% admitted to be at risk for HIV-1 and 11% changed their sex habits after first hearing of AIDS. No lesbian had ever practised safe-sex. Television was the most important source of information on HIV-1 (84%).; CONCLUSION: I.v. drug use was the most likely means of HIV-1 infecting the lesbians of Turin. The high rate of STDs and the low perceived risk to HIV-1 require programmes of STD prevention and AIDS information to be targeted at the lesbian community.

PY 1994
PD 1994 
AB Efforts to prevent child sexual abuse have taken a distinctly different path from efforts to prevent the physical abuse of children. Currently, child sexual abuse prevention is virtually synonymous with group-based instruction for children on personal safety, and it appears that most schools and many after-school programs provide some form of group-based sexual abuse prevention education. Many evaluations have assessed the impact of these efforts. Seventeen studies employing random assignment to treatment and control groups are summarized in Table 1 on page 206, and 21 additional studies using quasi-experimental designs are briefly reviewed in the article text. Most studies conclude that children do learn from the experience, although such learning is neither universal nor comprehensive. Most evaluations measure the child's knowledge but are unable to assess whether a gain in knowledge will lead to a sustained beneficial change in the child's behavior. In an effort to focus on behavior change, child safety programs increasingly utilize role playing and participant modeling. A major benefit of personal safety education programs may be an increased rate of disclosures by children of past or present abuse. A major area of concern may be the potential for safety education programs to engender fear and anxiety in children Research on negative impacts is limited, and results have been mixed. The author concludes that prevention programs overall have beneficial impacts, which are strongest for children 7 to 12 years old. Characteristics of promising programs are summarized. The article concludes with suggestions for expanding prevention efforts to include public and parent education, life skills training for young adults, support groups for vulnerable children and adults, and intervention for identified victims and perpetrators.

Parental ratings of childrens' problem behaviors were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The sample (mean age, 12.4 years) comprised a group of biological siblings (111 pairs), a group of nonbiological siblings (221 pairs), and a group of singletons (94). Nonshared environmental influences were most important for problem behaviors studied in this paper. Genetic influences were substantial for Externalizing behaviors but unimportant for Internalizing behaviors. For the CBCL total problem score, Attention Problems, and Externalizing behaviors, the results of the present study were in agreement with findings from twin studies. The lack of genetic influences on Internalizing behaviors contrasts with results from twin studies. For the total problem score, the Externalizing grouping, Delinquent Behavior, and Aggressive Behavior, variances for singletons were significantly smaller than for siblings. Model fit indices indicated that these differences in variances are better attributed to smaller effects of factors associated with sibship size than to active influences of siblings on each other. Significant sex differences were found for 8 of the 10 scales. The larger variances for boys on the Externalizing grouping and Aggressive Behavior could be explained by genetic influences.

AB Measures of temperament and early environment were obtained from 108 patients with major depression using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). TPQ and PBI measures distinguished between depressed patients and controls. Depressed patients with comorbid axis I disorders appear to be temperamentally different from those who do not have these disorders. Those with alcoholism have higher novelty seeking (NS) scores; those with panic disorder have higher harm avoidance (HA) scores; and those with simple phobia have higher persistence (P) scores. More than half the patients had an axis II disorder. Those with a comorbid personality disorder recall worse parental care and have lower reward dependence (RD) scores. Individual personality disorders and DSM-III-R personality disorder clusters reflect to a significant degree underlying temperament as measured by the TPQ. These results suggest that it is possible to better understand the patterns of comorbidity between major depression, other axis I disorders, and personality disorders by studying the underlying temperament dimensions in these patients.

In the period from 1987 to May 1993 thirty-three patients underwent transcutaneous drainage (TD) of pancreatic cysts at the Burdenko Facultative Surgical Clinic, MMA; a total of 35 procedures were performed. In all cases TD was conducted under control of USE and roentgeno-television (RTV) by Seldinger's method or with various types of stylet catheters. The transperitoneal approach was preferable in cysts of the head, in cysts of the body of the gland hze transgastric approach was used under control of gastroscopy for later attempt to accomplish transcutaneous cystogastrostomy. Contrast examination of the cyst immediately after puncture revealed its connection with the pancreatic duct (PD). Fistulography was repeated every 5-7 days. In the absence of a cystopancreatic fistula the cyst was sclerosed with 96 degrees ethyl alcohol. Complications were encountered in 11% of cases and a recurrent cyst developed in one patient. The TD method under control of USE and RTV is effective in the treatment of pancreatic cysts attended by a low incidence of complications. A large size of the cyst, its infection or connection with the pancreatic duct are not contraindications for TD.

AB This study examined the personal health goals and needs of 1,299 soldiers during their periodic health exam at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, from January 1 to December 31, 1990. The two most important goals of this population were improving self-esteem (50%) and family relationships (43%). In contrast, smoking cessation (17%) and avoiding problems with alcohol (4.3%) were listed 14th and 19th priority, and were desired by only 56% and 61%, respectively, of those who needed help in these areas. Differences between soldiers' health goals and health needs must be considered when designing successful health-promotion programs.

AB OBJECTIVES: CD4 lymphocyte counts decrease with the duration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We used CD4 counts collected for clinical reasons to evaluate the stage of HIV infection and the epidemiology of recent HIV infections among attendees of South Carolina's public health clinics.; METHODS: We measured the CD4 T-lymphocyte counts of persons newly diagnosed with HIV infection April 1989 through June 1990 at South Carolina public health clinics who returned for follow-up.; RESULTS: Of 812 newly diagnosed HIV-infected health department patients, 420 (52%) had their CD4 lymphocyte counts measured. Of these 420, 51 (12%) had CD4 counts of < 200, the level below which prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia prolongs survival, and 193 (46%) had CD4 counts of < 500, the level below which zidovudine may prolong disease-free survival. The highest CD4 counts (> or = 900), which are associated with more recent HIV infection, were more common in females.; CONCLUSIONS: In South Carolina, almost half of newly reported HIV-infected persons who agreed to CD4 testing at the health department might benefit from immediate drug therapy. Within this population, women may be an emerging risk group that requires specifically directed HIV prevention efforts.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study examined associations between religious variables and alcohol abuse and dependence among 2,969 North Carolina residents aged 18 to 97 who participated in the 1983-1984 National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area survey at its Piedmont location.; METHODS: Six-month and lifetime prevalence of alcohol disorders were compared among participants reporting varying levels of religious activity. Data were collected on frequency of Bible reading, prayer, and church attendance; time spent watching or listening to religious programming on television or radio; importance of religion; religious denomination; and identification as "born-again" Christians.; RESULTS: Recent and lifetime alcohol disorders were less common among weekly churchgoers and those who considered themselves born again. Recent, but not lifetime, alcohol disorders were also less common among respondents who frequently read the Bible or prayed privately. Alcohol disorders were more common among those who frequently watched or listened to religious television and radio. Lifetime, but not recent, alcohol disorders were more prevalent among members of Pentecostal denominations.; CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal study is necessary to further clarify and explain these relationships between religious practices and alcohol disorders.

AB Current research is classified into different theoretical approaches, mainly economic deprivation theories, stress-related theories, gender theories and different psychological and sociological theories. The correlations between unemployment and ill-health are explained as a result of both selection and exposure. The societal consequences of youth unemployment have been studied in aggregate studies. The familial consequences is a neglected area, but there is evidence of increased illness as well as battering of wives and children. Almost all research has been focused on the individual and mainly on the psychological consequences. Consistent relationships are found between unemployment and minor psychological disorders. Few studies have included somatic health but the results indicate increased physiological illness, especially among unemployed girls. Increased health care consumption has been documented. There are evidence that unemployment is a risk indicator for both increasing alcohol consumption, particularly in young men. Unemployment is also associated with increased tobacco consumption, increased use of illicit drugs as well as deteriorated health behaviour. The mortality rate is significantly higher among unemployed young men and women, especially in suicides and accidents. Social consequences include increased risk of alienation, lack of financial resources, criminality and future exclusion from the labour market. As mediating factors social support, high employment rate, negative attitudes towards work and high possibility of control have been documented to have a protective effect on health. Research should now be directed towards more qualitative methods, based on theoretical models, in order to search for deeper mechanisms, mediating factors and explanatory theories of the unevenly distributed health in society, in which unemployment has been proved to be one important factor.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study explored a multifactorial model of vulnerability to homelessness among male veterans of the Vietnam war generation.; METHOD: Data from 1,460 male veterans who participated in the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study were used to evaluate hypotheses about the causes of homelessness grouped into four sets of sequential variables: 1) premilitary risk factors, 2) war related and non-war-related traumatic experiences, 3) lack of social support at the time of discharge from military service, and 4) postmilitary psychiatric disorder and social dysfunction. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the posited model of risk factors for homelessness.; RESULTS: Postmilitary social isolation, psychiatric disorder, and substance abuse had the strongest direct effects on homelessness, although substantial indirect effects from stressors related to being in the war zone and from premilitary conduct disorder were observed. Several premilitary factors--year of birth, childhood physical or sexual abuse, other childhood traumas, and placement in foster care during childhood--also had direct effects on homelessness.; CONCLUSIONS: Individual vulnerability to homelessness is most likely due to a multiplicity of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric factors, with independent influences emerging at each of four discrete time periods. In view of this complex pattern of influences, prevention efforts directed at individuals must address a very broad range of adjustment problems.

AB OBJECTIVES: The relationships between television beer advertising and drinking knowledge, beliefs, and intentions were investigated in a survey of schoolchildren. The research was guided by a theoretical model specifying that awareness of advertising, and not mere exposure, is necessary for it to have an effect on beliefs or behaviors.; METHODS: Participants were a random sample of 468 fifth- and sixth-grade schoolchildren from a northern California community. Data were collected in the home with a combination of self-administered questionnaires and structured interviews.; RESULTS: Nonrecursive statistical modeling indicated that awareness of television beer advertising was related to more favorable beliefs about drinking, to greater knowledge of beer brands and slogans, and to increased intentions to drink as an adult. The effects of advertising awareness on knowledge, beliefs, and intentions were maintained when the reciprocal effects of beliefs, knowledge, and intentions on awareness were controlled.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that alcohol advertising may predispose young people to drinking. As a result, efforts to prevent drinking and drinking problems among young people should give attention to countering the potential effects of alcohol advertising.

AB STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible changes in smoking and drinking habits during pregnancy and to elucidate the sociodemographic factors associated with these changes in Spanish women.; DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey.; PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 1004 pregnant women of between 12 and 18 weeks of gestation who were attending the antenatal clinic of the main regional hospital of Valencia (Spain) during 1989 were studied. All participants completed the study and only one eligible woman refused to participate when approached.; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Information was obtained by structured questionnaire (Euromac questionnaire), which included items on age, educational level, marital status, occupation, parity, previous and present smoking habits, and previous and present alcohol consumption. Women were asked about the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol for a typical week before they knew they were pregnant, and details of current consumption were obtained for the week before the interview. The number of drinks taken per week was later converted to the amount of absolute alcohol (in g). Sixty per cent of the women smoked and 72% drank alcohol before pregnancy. Forty eight per cent of smokers stopped smoking and 37% of drinkers stopped drinking alcohol during pregnancy. No sociodemographic factor showed an independent association with either smoking or drinking cessation. Only the number of cigarettes and the amount of alcohol consumed before pregnancy were identified as significant independent predictors for stopping.; CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant Spanish women seemed to stop smoking at about three times the rate found in Spanish women in the reproductive years. The sociodemographic variables usually associated with stopping smoking could not account for the high rate of quitting in these Spanish women, a rate higher than that in women from other developed countries. The high prevalence of smoking before pregnancy might explain not only the high rate of stopping smoking but also the absence of a well defined profile of "quitters". In our study, high levels of alcohol consumption were limited to a small group of pregnant women, and preventive efforts should be focused on this group.

A2 The community center at the housing estate of St. Mellons in Cardiff,
   Wales, has two projects serving youth.  A physician and nurse make up a
   team operating family planning clinic at the youth center on Friday
   afternoons.  Local graffiti artists have created brightly colored
   posters to promote the drop-in center.  Teenagers come to the youth
   center to play pool, drink coffee, and to listen to music.  In a room
   next to this activity, the team distributes contraceptives (e.g.,
   condoms).  They also counsel teens about sexuality, relationships,
   self-respect, health, and disease.   They work to dispel any incorrect
   information that they often hear.  Counseling provides the teens correct
   information, which they can convey to their peers.  The director of
   family planning and well-woman services for South Glamorgan finds peer
   education to be more effective than sex education in schools.  A
   psychiatric nurse and her community drug colleagues set up a drop-in
   center for a needle exchange, but the team finds itself acting as a
   drugs information service.  The advice it gives includes ho to use drugs
   more safely, possible adverse reactions, referrals (medical,
   detoxification, and counseling), and the nature of substances on the
   street.  Clients trust the team so much that they share with the team
   members when there is a bad drug on the market.  An outreach worker has
   headed up a residential week-end with some teens to further discuss drug
   use.  Despite their success and popularity, lack of financial or human
   resources prevents expansion of both service.  The drug needle
   exchange/information service tried to work out of another youth center,
   but fear by neighbors that it would give the area a bad name hampered
   its opening.

AB The differential effectiveness of same- versus opposite-sex role models in persuading teenagers to reduce alcohol consumption was investigated. Based on an actual set of commercials, four 1-min videos were constructed, in which either boys or girls discuss how alcohol adversely affects either boys or girls. These were shown to either teenage boys or girls, resulting in a 2(Sex of Source) x 2(Sex of Subjects [Ss]) factorial design. Ss rated the credibility of the source, the persuasibility of the message, said how much and how often they drank currently, and whether they intended to decrease their future alcohol consumption. Three studies were conducted, in a coeducational (N = 95), boys' (N = 98), and girls' (N = 102) school, respectively. The overall pattern in the data showed that as predicted, same-sex role models were more effective, and that moderate drinkers were more influenced than heavy drinkers; both findings having implications for teenage health education campaigns.

AB Condom use was studied for 421 sexually active, minority male adolescents who were currently in jail in New York City. Over three-quarters of the youths were users of alcohol and marijuana and about one-quarter were users of cocaine or crack, but drug injectors were rare. In the six months before arrest they had multiple sexual partners and about one-third had engaged in anal intercourse. Inconsistent condom use was the norm, with 17% reporting that they never used condoms and only 15% reporting that they used condoms every time for insertive sex. In multivariate analysis, more frequent condom use was independently predicted by gay/bisexual preference, greater acceptability and accessibility of condoms, partners' receptivity to use, self-initiation of use, and self-efficacy of avoiding AIDS. Condoms were used less frequently with steady than with causual partners, and rarely for anal or oral sex. AIDS prevention curricula addressing these factors should be delivered to high risk adolescents while they are temporarily accessible in jail. 
A2 Studies have found criminally-involved male adolescents to be highly
   sexually active, involved in unprotected sexual activities with multiple
   partners, and heavy consumers of alcohol and drugs extensively,
   behaviors which are conducive to HIV exposure and transmission.  This
   paper reports findings on the sex behavior and condom use of 421
   sexually active, minority male adolescents incarcerated at the
   Adolescent Reception Center on Rikers Island during February
   1991-February 1992.  The volunteers were aged 16-19 years (median age,
   17.8 years), 98.8% were Black or Hispanic, 95.2% were heterosexual, 3.3%
   were bisexual, and 1.4% were gay.  Each young man was compensated with
   $10 credited to his commissary accounts for participation in a 90-minute
   personal interview.  38.0% had been arrested for robbery, 27.3% for drug
   offenses, 16.9% for property crimes, and 13.5% for weapons offenses. 
   9.0% were in for murder.  74.8% were detained, while the remained had
   been sentenced.  During the month before arrest, 81.0% consumed alcohol,
   76.0% smoked marijuana, and approximately 25% used cocaine or crack
   cocaine, but IV drug use was rare.  Only 1% of the sample reported ever
   using IV drugs.  They had an average of three partners each during the 6
   months before arrest, although few had identifiable high-risk partners. 
   17% reported never using condoms and 15% reported using condoms every
   time for insertive sex.  Inconsistent condom use was therefore the norm.
   15.9% had ever had a STD.  Multivariate analysis found more frequent
   condom use to be independently predicted by gay/bisexual preference,
   greater acceptability and accessibility of condoms, partners'
   receptivity to use, self-initiation of use, and self-efficacy of
   avoiding AIDS.  Condoms were used less frequently with steady than with
   casual partners, and rarely for anal or oral sex.  30% of heterosexual
   and 60% of gay/bisexual youths reported engaging in anal intercourse. 
   83% of the sample believed that it is hard to get HIV from sex.  Most
   believed that they had already changed their behavior to reduce their
   risk, such as reducing the number of sex partners, being more selective
   of sex partners, and/or increasing condom use.  AIDS prevention messages
   should be conveyed to these adolescents while they are a captive
   audience.

A2 Photo-comics are an ideal format for education of South African youth
   about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) given their low literacy
   rate and the widespread popularity of comic books.  An example of the
   success of this strategy is "Roxy:  Life, Love, and Sex in the
   Nineties," a comic produced as part of a school-based AIDS prevention
   program run by the National AIDS Research Program.  The comic tells the
   story of an adolescent girl who learns her friend committed suicide
   because she was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
   Roxy learns about AIDS and discusses the risk factors with her friends.
   Focus group discussions were used to generate story ideas and pretesting
   of the comic book took place among several student groups.  By July
   1993, 30,000 copies of "Roxy" had been distributed to students,
   churches, youth groups, civic associations, and organizations working
   with street children.  In addition, the comic was reproduced in a
   magazine, "Upbeat," that is popular among out-of-school youth.
   Qualitative evaluation through 8 student focus groups revealed that
   young people from various cultural backgrounds strongly identify with
   the themes, characters, and situations depicted in "Roxy."  Of
   particular significance were the realistic portrayals of romantic and
   sexual relationships, relationships with parents, and dilemmas posed by
   pressures to use drugs and alcohol.  The comic includes a sex education
   chart with concise condom use instructions.

During the time covered by the surveys, these adolescents were exposed to an eclectic variety of both school and community-based prevention and intervention programs. The surveys indicate that younger students have increasingly delayed their entry into use of alcohol and other drugs; older students also show some declines in use, comparable to those reported nationally, but heavy, regular use of both marijuana and alcohol persists as well among a substantial minority. The article concludes with consideration of the perceived effectiveness of the community's prevention efforts, the justifications for these judgments, and the implications of these for further programming efforts.

This study examined the relationship of depression, attitude toward pregnancy, a number of sociodemographic variables, and substance use by women of child-bearing age prior to and after learning of their pregnancies. Results indicated that attitude independently, and depression independently and in interaction with socio-demographic factors are associated with substance use at both time points. From this we conclude that preventive efforts should be designed and targeted at those women who are depressed, especially those who have the sociodemographic characteristics associated with heavier substance use.

AB OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the rationale and design features of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the baseline characteristics of participants enrolled up to March 31st 1993. The objectives include epidemiological, clinical and laboratory research.; DESIGN: The SHCS is a prospective cohort study of HIV infected adolescents and adults seen at the outpatient clinics of the Swiss University Hospitals in Basle, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich and the Cantonal Hospital St. Gall. The multicentre collaboration was initiated in September 1988 by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. Data collected prior to this date by several participating centers using a similar protocol were included, the earliest records dating back to 1982. Follow-up visits are scheduled every 6 months.; ENROLLMENT: As of March 31st 1993, 6253 participants (M: 4580, F: 1675) were included with a total of 16015 person-years of follow-up (mean 2.6 years). HIV transmission categories were 46% intravenous drug users (IDU), 32% men who had sex with men (MSM), 18% heterosexual contacts (HET) and 4% other. The proportion of MSM among male participants decreased from 62% in 1985 to 40% in 1987, to remain stable thereafter. The proportion of IDU among males was around 40% throughout, whereas in females, there was a pronounced decline from 90% IDU in 1985 to 50% in 1992. Conversely, there was a striking increase in registrations of women presumably infected by HET, from 8% in 1985 to 50% in 1992. Among men, the proportion classified as HET increased from 2% to 15%. It is estimated, that a large proportion of all Swiss AIDS patients (70%) and HIV infected individuals (32%-47%) are enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. Losses to follow-up, however, are common.; CONCLUSIONS: The SHCS serves multiple purposes as a research project, as infrastructure for multidisciplinary research and as a tool to improve patient care. Several international and national trials, post-marketing surveillances and expanded access protocols were or still are based upon its infrastructure. The large number of female participants and of participants AIDS-free at entry, make the database especially valuable.

AB Despite the central role played by female intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in the worsening AIDS statistics of states in the northeastern United States, the relative paucity of research into the HIV risk behaviors--particularly risky needle practices--of female drug injections has left significant gaps in researchers' understanding of how and to what extent such women may differ in their risks from their better-studied male counterparts. This study, derived from a sample of 769 out-of-treatment IVDUs residing in an area (Paterson, New Jersey) characterized by high levels of AIDS and HIV infection among drug users, attempts to address this lacuna in the research literature by comparing the drug usage, AIDS knowledge, and needle and sexual behaviors of male and female IVDUs that place them at risk for HIV infection. In this sample, gender was found to be unrelated to HIV serostatus, injection frequency and injected drug of choice, and to most dimensions of knowledge about AIDS and the means of HIV transmission. Overall, it appears that the average Paterson female IVDU may be at greater risk for HIV infection as a result of involvement with a drug-using sex partner than because of especially risky needle practices, for females in this sample were significantly more likely than males to report injecting with a sex partner in the previous 6 months, and female IVDUs with one sex partner were more than twice as likely as males with one partner to report that this individual was an IVDU. Condom use was relatively rare, particularly among those with one partner. Moreover, female IVDUs were significantly more likely than males to be daily users of crack cocaine, and significantly more likely to report poorer health. However, current needle and sexual practices were found to be unrelated to HIV seropositivity among both males and females. In logistic regression analysis, only length of IV drug involvement was found to be independently associated with HIV seropositivity for both sexes. Implications of the data for future prevention efforts aimed at female IVDUs are discussed.

AB This study examines the relationship between children's reports of their parents' drinking patterns, and the child's alcohol misuse and heavy alcohol use in early adolescence. Subjects were 2,213 fifth and sixth grade students. Data on the child's alcohol use and misuse, and parent alcohol use, were derived from classroom-administered questionnaires. Increased reported level of drinking by mother or by father was significantly associated with increased odds of alcohol misuse and heavy alcohol use among the children; these results held for both boys and girls when examined separately. Examination for possible confounding effects of assortative mating by parental drinking suggests that reports of heavy drinking in either parent increases the risk of alcohol misuse and heavy alcohol use in children. Implications for prevention efforts are discussed.

A2 While few adolescents world-wide have AIDS, it is estimated that half
   the people infected with HIV became infected when they were 15-24 years
   old.  Health professionals assert that HIV exists in adolescent
   populations that are marked by sexually transmitted diseases and/or
   adolescent pregnancies.  Research has revealed that most young people
   worldwide first experience sexual intercourse while they are in their
   teens.  This situation has been exacerbated by rural-urban migration and
   the breakdown of traditional sources of information, by the risk-taking
   nature of adolescence that leads to drug and alcohol abuse, by cultural
   norms that lead young women to preserve their virginity by engaging in
   anal sex, by the poverty that causes youth to trade sex for survival. 
   The HIV/AIDS prevention efforts aimed at young people have been
   successful in increasing their knowledge about transmission of the
   infection but not in changing their risky behavior.  In order to change
   adolescent social norms, influential young people should be used as peer
   educators, parents and teachers should be enlisted in prevention
   efforts, young people should be involved in the planning of the
   programs, and all of the needs of the adolescents should be addressed. 
   In addition, HIV/AIDS programs must provide services for those youth who
   are already infected.  It is difficult for prevention programs to engage
   in safer sex training because of a lack of consensus about whether to
   give adolescents information only or to provide condoms.  The AIDS
   epidemic has at least provided an opportunity for societies to address
   how sex education should proceed and has given rise to the innovative
   idea that adolescents require their own health services.

AB This study prospectively explores relations of usual alcohol intake in a Northern California population of 128,934 persons to risk of subsequent unnatural death. Of 385 such deaths during the 8-year study period, 88 were due to motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), 106 to suicide, 52 to homicide, and 139 to miscellaneous other unnatural causes. Comparisons of ex-drinkers and 5 levels of current drinkers to lifelong abstainers were studied by Cox proportional hazards models with 9 covariates. In adjusted analyses, persons reporting intake of 6 or more drinks daily were at greatly increased risk of death from suicide (6 times) and homicide (7 times), and at moderately increased risk of death from MVAs (2 times). Lighter and ex-drinkers were not at significantly increased risk for all unnatural deaths or any of its subsets. Among persons reporting 6 or more drinks/day, women and persons below 50 years of age were at especially high risk, but Blacks and Whites were at similar risk. Persons who usually drank liquor or wine were at greater risk for MVAs than those who usually drank beer; beverage choice was unrelated to the other causes of death. Among other covariates, men and not married persons were at higher risk and college graduates at lower risk, for each cause of death. The only major racial difference was a lower risk of suicide for Blacks (versus Whites). These data provide considerable detail about usual alcohol use and risk of unnatural death. They point to special need for preventive efforts among younger persons and women, with particular attention to suicide and homicide.

The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Evaluation of Street Outreach Projects (AESOP) is an eight-site study designed by CDC in collaboration with researchers in each of the sites to better understand client characteristics, service delivery, and the impact of street outreach programs on the risk behaviors of high-risk populations. The populations studied are injecting-drug users (IDUs) in five of the eight sites and youth in high-risk situations (YHRS) (i.e., youths aged 12-23 years who are homeless or runaway or who support themselves through the "street economy" of drugs, prostitution, pan-handling, and crime) in three sites. This report summarizes information collected during the first 2 years of the project.

AB A household survey of 1160 Western Australian adults was used as a basis for exploring drinkers' reports about the settings in which they drank alcohol and their experiences of alcohol related harm. Of the 873 drinkers identified, 7.9% had experienced some form of acute alcohol related harm over the previous 3 months. Violent incidents were the most common of these and drink-driving offences the least. Such harm was significantly more likely among drinkers who variously drank 'heavily', were male, single, under 25 years of age and/or who drank on licensed premises. Regression analyses revealed that even when demographic characteristics of the drinkers were controlled for licensed premises were significantly more likely to be the settings used prior to harm occurring. Bar staff continuing to serve 'obviously intoxicated' customers was the most powerful predictor of harm. Premises which offered discounted drinks or permitted crowding also tended to be those where intoxication was permitted but these variables were not directly associated with an increased risk of harm. These findings lend further weight to the view that prevention efforts should focus on licensed drinking environments and, in particular, the practice of continuing to serve obviously intoxicated customers.

AB OBJECTIVES: This paper analyzes age- and period-related changes in risk behaviors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and sexually transmitted diseases among young men in the United States between 1988 and 1991.; METHODS: Data were from the 1988 and 1991 waves of the National Survey of Adolescent Males. The 1988 survey was a nationally representative survey of 1880 males aged 15 through 19 years. The 1991 survey was a longitudinal follow-up of 1676 males aged 17 through 22 years.; RESULTS: As they aged, the young men increased their levels of sexual activity and decreased their condom use. Period-related changes between 1988 and 1991 were examined by comparing similar cohorts of 17.5- through 19-year-old men: there were signs that sexual activity and intravenous drug injection increased, but condom use did not change significantly. In 1991 51% of the young men said they were occasionally "high" during sex, a state that is related to reduced condom use.; CONCLUSIONS: Early progress in fostering safer behaviors among young men slowed and possibly stopped as the nation entered the 1990s. Prevention efforts need to be renewed and should focus on older youth and young adults.

A2 In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new labeling
   guidelines for oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs),
   implantable and injectable contraceptives, and natural membrane condoms.
   The prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the AIDS
   epidemic prompted the FDA to take this action as part of an on-going
   education effort to reduce the risk in sexually active individuals,
   particularly adolescents and young adults.  In spite of strong
   educational efforts, many adolescents and young adults.  In spite of
   strong educational efforts, many adolescents and young adults, are
   continuing to engage in high-risk sexual behavior.  The required
   statement for oral contraceptives, subdermal implants, injectables, and
   IUDs is:  "This product is intended to prevent pregnancy.  It does not
   protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted
   diseases."  For latex condoms the message reads:  "If used properly,
   latex condoms will help reduce the risk of transmission of HIV infection
   (AIDS) and many other sexually transmitted diseases."  For female
   condoms the label reads:  "If you are not going to use a male latex
   condom, you can use a female condom to help protect yourself and your
   partner."  The message on latex condoms will appear on individual condom
   wrappers as well as on the outer package.  Manufacturers will add a
   similar statement to patient and physician leaflets provided with the
   products.  Other contraceptives that may be relabeled in the future
   include spermicides, cervical caps, diaphragms, and the contraceptive
   sponge.  The new contraceptive labeling effort is part of a broader
   initiative of the US Public Health Service regarding women's health that
   focuses on health issues and diseases in women, including reproductive
   disorders, breast and other cancers, and substance abuse.

AB In order to describe a population of suicide attempters in an affluent suburb of Copenhagen, 100 patients were interviewed, randomly chosen from a group of 246 patients referred to psychiatric consultation after a suicide attempt. The group consisted of 71 women and 29 men. Single status, abuse, and previous suicide attempts occurred frequently as did suicide among first-degree relatives. The most frequent reason for a suicide attempt was conflict with partners. In comparison with the normal population in the same catchment area, the patients were alone and felt lonely, but no difference was found in the group's relation to the labor market. After a four-year follow-up period, 9 persons had died by suicide. Borderline personality disorder and affective psychosis, no employment, 2 or more previous attempts, violent method and potential lethal attempt proved to be predictors of suicide later on. Alcohol and drug abuse, lack of social support and loneliness did not influence the risk.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe morbidity, lifestyle and re-employment in a representative sample of unemployed people.; DESIGN: A two-year follow up of a routine health examination consisting of a structured interview, a clinical examination and the doctor's conclusions and advice.; SETTING: Four municipalities in Greenland, southern Norway.; PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample aged 16 to 63 who had been registered with the labour market authorities for more than 12 weeks.; RESULTS: Self-reported diseases were more common in the study group than were found in employed people, especially musculoskeletal and mental disorders. The prevalence of medical diagnoses was high. Smoking was reported by nearly twice as many unemployed as the reference population. Heavy alcohol consumption was more prevalent in the unemployed men. Blood pressure was lower than in the reference population. Cholesterol was higher in the unemployed women. Many needed counselling or referrals. Having a medical diagnosis reduced the chances of re-employment two years later. Thus, health-related selection for re-employment seems to explain some of the excess morbidity among unemployed people.; CONCLUSION: The long-term unemployed is a group with high morbidity and unhealthy lifestyle. General practitioners should be aware of this pattern in clinical and preventive work.

This paper seeks to examine the relationship between ethnic identification and alcohol use on the basis of data collected from a survey of 667 high school students in Toronto. Results show that when other variables (sociodemographic, school, family, availability, and informal social control) are controlled for, the relationship between ethnic identification and alcohol use remains significant in Canadian-born students but not in foreign-born students. Also, foreign-born students are found to exhibit lower levels of alcohol use than their Canadian-born counterparts, regardless of cultural origin. Implications of the findings for future studies of ethnicity and alcohol/drug use and for prevention efforts are discussed.

AB Recent research has suggested that effective prenatal care is significantly related to positive outcomes for the teen mother and her infant. One aspect of prenatal care is the efforts of the pregnant teen to care for herself, often called self-care practices. The purpose of this article is to compare the self-reported self-care activities of pregnant teenagers who sought prenatal care during the first trimester of their pregnancies with those of pregnant teens who delayed prenatal care until the third trimester. The subjects were adolescent girls who were enrolled in prenatal care programs or who had recently delivered in Florida. Interview analysis suggested that both groups had an adequate knowledge level regarding diet, exercise, and other topics related to self-care during pregnancy. Although pregnant teens practice similar self-care behaviors regardless of when they enter prenatal care, there are many problems that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes and can remain undetected when prenatal care is delayed. 
A2 Nurse practitioners interviewed 48 adolescents who were either pregnant
   or had just delivered to learn how they cared for themselves.  The teens
   were attending or had attended prenatal clinics in Florida.  They were
   divided into 2 groups:  34 teens who began prenatal care in the 1st
   trimester and 12 teens who did in the 3rd trimester.  73% of teens in
   the early group considered prenatal care as a self-care activity, while
   just 1 in the late group did.  All but 1 teen practiced self-care
   throughout the pregnancy, sometimes before formally entering prenatal
   care.  94.1% in the early group and 83.3% in the late group reported
   that family members helped with self-care.  Some nutrition self-care
   activities were increased intake of milk and vegetables and a decrease
   of elimination of fatty foods and caffeine.  97% in the early group and
   75% in the late group enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children
   program.  54% in the early group and 41% in the late group used vitamin
   and mineral supplements.  67.6% in early group and 75% in late group
   either continued or began to exercise during pregnancy.  35.2% in the
   early group and 41.6% in the late group took more time to sleep and
   rest.  Even though some teens abused substances before pregnancy, they
   all reported no drug or alcohol use during pregnancy.  3 early-group
   teens and 1 late-group teen still smokes cigarettes, even though they
   knew it was unhealthy for the baby.  Most teens avoided strenuous
   activities, e.g., team sports.  Even though the teens practiced
   self-care, delay of prenatal care can still lead to poor pregnancy
   outcomes.  An increased need exists for health education or self-care in
   public schools and during routine preventive health care, mass media
   campaigns on pregnancy signs and symptoms and early prenatal care, and
   support from parents and other family members.

AB Because the family plays an important role in predicting alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among youth, prevention efforts must begin in early childhood and involve parents. The purpose of this study was to determine differences between parent AOD users and nonusers in relation to health beliefs about parent involvement in AOD prevention with preschool children. A convenience sample of 200 Head Start parents in East Central Indiana completed self-report instruments measuring Health Belief Model constructs. Almost half (45%) reported alcohol use, over half (54%) smoked cigarettes, and 11% admitted using illicit drugs. Compared to nonusers, illicit drug users were more likely to perceive their children as susceptible to future AOD use, but less likely to view AOD use by their children as serious. Compared with nonsmokers, tobacco users were more likely to perceive their children as susceptible to future AOD use and had less interest in maintaining health through early prevention activities.

White male adolescents who reported engaging in five or more risky behaviors were most likely to name a heavy metal music group as their favorite. Adolescents reported reading a wide diversity of magazines, and most reported reading at least one of a few selected magazines. Sports and music magazines were most likely to be read by adolescents who had engaged in many risky behaviors.; CONCLUSIONS: Mass media health promotion efforts could more specifically target adolescents who are engaging in multiple risky behaviors.

AB Despite considerable progress, tobacco use continues to be a major public health problem in the United States, killing more U.S. citizens each year than alcohol, cocaine, crack, heroin, homicide, suicide, car accidents, fires, and AIDS combined. There is cause for particular concern about smoking and other tobacco use by children. Although adolescent smoking declined in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the combination of a now-flat daily smoking prevalence rate among high school seniors, high smoking rates among high school dropouts, and increased use of smokeless tobacco argues for renewed efforts in tobacco use prevention. The greater risk associated with tobacco use at early ages suggests the need for comprehensive interventions (i.e., involving policy change, advertising restrictions, health professionals, and comprehensive school health education) before the prime age for tobacco use initiation (i.e., 12 to 14 years old), for repeated reinforcement of these interventions through adolescence, for innovative ways of reaching underserved--particularly high-risk and minority--youth with effective tobacco use prevention efforts, and for research to determine both the short-term and the long-term effectiveness of these approaches.

AB Blast trauma within the oropharyngeal cavity may be associated with superficial or deep injuries. Superficial injury generally needs only observation; deeper injury that violates the retropharyngeal space may produce dissecting emphysema into the neck and mediastinum followed by prevertebral soft tissue infections and mediastinitis. Injury involving the parapharyngeal space might damage vital cervical vessels. Life-threatening complications may result unless treatment is adequate. Three children who sustained oropharyngeal blast injury are presented. The direct cause was the blast effect of a new, spoiled, orange-flavor beverage just released on the market. The bottle cap of the soft drink and its effervescent liquid "exploded" into their mouths while they were trying to open the bottle with their teeth. Obviously, the failure to observe due precautions, as frequently happens among children, contributed to the occurrence of the accidents. This paper describes the diagnosis, management, and relevant educational and preventive measures of the problem.

AB The recent spread of crack cocaine use among inner-city teenagers has been accompanied by dramatic increases in juvenile delinquency and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among teenagers. This study examined the prevalence of five factors which promote STDs, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), among a sample of sexually active black adolescent crack users and non-users from the San Francisco Bay Area. Significant differences were observed between these groups with respect to history of engaging in sexual intercourse under the influence of drugs or alcohol, exchanging sexual favors for drugs or money, condom use in the most recent sexual encounter, and having five or more sexual partners in the last year. Approximately 63% of all respondents reported engaging in at least one of these risk behaviors. In multiple logistic regression analysis, reporting one or more of these STD/HIV risk behaviors was significantly associated with crack use and having one or more relatives who used drugs. Intervention efforts need to address both individual and environmental risk factors in order to reduce teens' risk for STDs, including HIV. 
A2 Researchers combined data from two surveys conducted in the summer of
   1988 to examine the association between sexually transmitted diseases
   (STD) risk behaviors and crack cocaine use among sexually active, black
   teenagers.  All of the subjects lived in an inner city neighborhood in
   the San Francisco Bay Area in California.  The Centers for Disease
   Control had earlier found a large increase in gonorrhea among black
   teenagers in San Francisco.  Crack users were more likely the nonusers
   to have sexual intercourse under the influence of drugs or alcohol (43%
   vs. 11% for boys and 46% vs. 14% for girls; p  .001), to take part in
   sexual acts placing them at risk for STD in exchange for money or drugs
   (29% vs. 4% for boys and 25% vs. 0 for girls; p  .001), and to have more
   sexual partners in the last year (11.1 vs. 5.3 partners for boys; p  .01
   and 4.5 vs. 2.5 partners for girls; insignificant).  Female nonusers
   were more likely to have used a condom during last sexual intercourse
   than were female crack users (39% vs. 18%; p  .01).  For both groups of
   boys, condom use during the last sexual act was at the same low rate
   (about 25%).  Approximately 63% of all adolescents admitted to having at
   least one sexual risk behavior.  Crack cocaine use and having at least
   one relative who used drugs were the greatest predictors of STD risk
   behavior (odds ratios, 2.2 and 1.97; p  .001 and  .01, respectively). 
   An urban anthropology study in the same neighborhoods showed that the
   teenagers lived in an area conducive to high-risk behaviors including
   drug use common among friends and relatives, more than one sexual
   partner/year, high prevalence of STDs, and low condom use.  The findings
   from these studies indicated that public health workers planning to
   implement interventions to prevent or reduce the risk of teenage drug
   use and/or HIV infection must consider both individual and environmental
   influences.

AB Sixty-one serologically positive HIV infected drug abusers admitted to the Drug Ward, General Hospital, Kota Bharu, were interviewed for possible risk behaviour and AIDS awareness. Fifty-eight subjects were IV abusers while the other 3 were non-IV abusers. All the IV abusers had shared injecting equipment with no regard for sterility. There was non-usage of condoms among those sexually active. Though AIDS awareness was high, there was a lack of risk behaviour change. The drug abusers appear to be a problem group in HIV control measures. Educating the drug abusers and commitment by them to alter risk behaviour is needed. 
A2 The authors explored the epidemiology, characteristics, risk behavior
   patterns, and level of HIV awareness among 61 HIV-seropositive drug
   users in the drug ward of the General Hospital in Kota Bharu.  Interview
   data were collected between August 1990 and July 1991 on the study
   population aged 14-45 years admitted to the ward for drug detection and
   detoxification.  58 were IV drug users (IVDU) and 3 were not.  The most
   commonly-used drug was morphine at 83.6%, followed by heroin at 14.8%.
   One person smoked cannabis.  All IVDUs had shared injecting equipment
   with 1-50 persons without worrying about sterility.  77% reported having
   heterosexual relations and 23% denied having any sexual activity; none
   admitted to having homosexual relations.  32 of the 47 heterosexually
   active individuals had contact with prostitutes and acquaintances, while
   the rest had sex with their wives or regular partners.  45 of these 47
   individuals never used condoms.  68.9% were aware of AIDS, but none
   changed their patterns of drug use or sexual activity.  These findings
   suggest that HIV prevention efforts among IVDUs have not been very
   successful and that further measures must be taken to encourage them to
   reduce their levels of HIV risk behavior.

AB The methodology for an information campaign is discussed, detailing follow up in five stages: (1) assessment of needs: a good knowledge of behaviour patterns and the kind of information needed is the basic element to create the concept of a campaign. A pre-survey is an indispensable tool to secure this information; (2) basic scientific information: communication to the public has to be based on precise and recent scientific data; (3) comprehension of the information: communicating with the general public should be through texts that are clear and accessible to the greater part of the population; (4) production of supporting documents: each element of the campaign has to produce an impact on the person receiving the message; and (5) evaluating the impact of an information campaign. An evaluation can check whether objectives have been reached, and also correct errors and help prepare the next campaign even more professionally. These five stages are essential to set up a successful information campaign. We also give examples from our magazines Cancer-info and Smoke Buster-info. Through information public opinion can be mobilized to influence political decisions in the public health sector. One evidence for the importance of collective influence on political decision makers is our campaign to promote the total ban on tobacco advertising. As large-scale information campaigns need important financial resources it is essential to balance the cost to generate sufficient funds to finance further projects in the health sector; we discuss this matter as well as the impact on the image of the association.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB This study investigated sleeping habits, difficulties in being able to fall asleep and their connections to self-reported health conditions, as well as other selected health behaviours and use of leisure time, among 11-16 year old Europeans from 11 countries. The study was part of a larger, comparative, WHO coordinated project on the health and life-style of school children (Health Behaviour of School Age Children--A WHO Cross-National Survey, The HBSC Study). In most of the countries, research data were collected from samples representative of the whole country. Using a standardized survey questionnaire, the data were collected anonymously in schools. Altogether 40,202 students responded to the survey. Sleeping habits and an inability to fall asleep varied significantly between countries as well as between age groups but only slightly between the sexes. Finnish school children experienced the most difficulty in being able to fall asleep. After the Israeli youth, the Finnish school children had the shortest night's sleep. At least a fifth of Finnish and Norwegian school children also reported that they felt tired almost every morning, the corresponding figure being smaller in other countries. A frequent use of psychoactive substances (alcohol and tobacco), lack of physical activity, excessive watching of TV/videos together with numerous evenings spent outside the home were all connected with going to bed late as well as with frequent difficulty in not being able to fall asleep. The results of the study offer an important challenge to health promotion and health education. Much more attention must be paid to this essential and exciting health habit!

Approximately 70% of men and 58% of women maintained their drinking status throughout the study. The onset of current and heavier drinking decreased with increasing age while the offset of current and heavier drinking increased with increasing age. The absence of current drinking was unrelated to age for both men and women as was the presence of heavier drinking among men.

AB Factors affecting the caffeine acetylation phenotype were investigated in a French Caucasian population of 150 unrelated supposedly healthy subjects, aged 18 to 63 years. This population, including 75 men and 75 women, was used to determine whether the acetylation polymorphism is related to environmental influences such as smoking habits, intake of alcohol, use of oral contraceptives, use of certain drugs. The acetylation phenotype was assessed from the molar ratio of two caffeine metabolites: 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil/1-methylxanthine. For values less than 0.85, the subjects were classified as poor acetylators (frequency, mean +/- SD: 61.3 +/- 7.9%) in this study. Dose recoveries of 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (mean +/- SD) were 1.26 +/- 0.85% and 3.58 +/- 1.64% in slow and rapid acetylators, respectively. The recovery (mean +/- SD) of 1-methylxanthine in the 3 hour-urine was 2.86 +/- 1.51% in slow acetylators and 2.36 +/- 1.27% in rapid acetylators. The mean value (and SD) of the molar ratio was 0.437 (0.177) and 1.669 (0.651) for slow and rapid acetylators. Three other metabolite ratios can also provide an acetylation index: 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil/5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3 - methyluracil + 1-methylxanthine + 1-methyluric acid; 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil/1-methylxanthine + 1-methyluric acid + 1,7-dimethyluric acid; and 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil/1-methylxanthine + 1-methyluric acid + 1,7-dimethyluric acid + 1,7-dimethylxanthine with a bimodal distribution for the former and a trimodal distribution for the two latter ratios, both showing about 95% concordance with the 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil/1-methylxanthine ratio. Age did not influence the excretion of caffeine and its five major metabolites. A marked influence of sex was observed only on the unchanged caffeine excretion, and the effect was greater in slow acetylators than in rapid acetylators. The 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil excretion was about three times higher in rapid acetylators than in slow acetylators in both sexes.

AB Three groups of subjects were asked to judge the probability that they and several target others (a friend, an acquaintance, a parent, a child) would experience various risks. Subjects were middle-class adults, their teenage children, and high-risk adolescents from treatment homes. All three groups saw themselves as facing somewhat less risk than the target others. However, this perception of relative invulnerability was no more pronounced for adolescents than for adults. Indeed, the parents were viewed as less vulnerable than their teenage children by both the adults and those teens. These results are consistent with others showing small differences in the cognitive decision-making processes of adolescents and adults. Underestimating teens' competence can mean misdiagnosing the sources of their risk behaviors, denying them deserved freedoms, and failing to provide needed assistance. 
A2 Policy choices depend in part of political values and assumptions about
   adolescents' decision making abilities.  The focus of this article is on
   judging the probability of adverse outcomes and the tendency to be
   overconfident.  Discussion is directed to adolescent and adult
   invulnerability and evidence of other decision making skills.  The
   conclusion from the review of evidence is that invulnerability is not
   particularly larger during adolescence.  The hypothesis of this study
   directly tests adolescent invulnerability.   A sample of 86 pairs of
   low-risk teens and parents and 95 high-risk teens were obtained from
   recruitment efforts at public high schools.  The mean age of students
   was 15 years; the mean age of adults was 43 years.  Low-risk persons
   were primarily girls and adults, more primarily mothers of teens.  23%
   of high risk teens were girls.  Eight events were chosen to reflect high
   and low controlability (auto accident injury, alcohol dependency,
   unplanned pregnancy, mugging, sickness from air pollution or pesticides
   or radiation poisoning, and injury in a fire explosion).  Evaluation for
   each event was made for controlability, probability of occurrence,
   preventive effort, and experience with the event.  Subjects also
   evaluated 2-3 target individuals.  The results pertain to the
   probability response mode as an ordinal scale; to control, prevention,
   and experience judgments; and to an examination of the absolute
   invulnerability hypothesis for group, target, and event factors.  43% of
   the time adolescents did not perceive any differences between their own
   level of risk and the target's.  Otherwise, respondents were twice as
   likely to assign a higher risk probability to targets.  10% of the time,
   subjects assigned a risk of 0 or no chance.  33% of the time, the risk
   was less than 1 in 10,000.  Risk was not any greater for teens than
   adults.  Teens tended to overdifferentiate their situation, as indicated
   in the Elkind fable.  Risk was gauged higher for the more active events.
   Teens were sensitive to how the question was posed; i.e. one time vs
   repeated actions.  Low-risk teens and adults were moderately
   overconfident; high risk teens showed greater overconfidence.  The
   theoretical and policy implications are dependent on the event; further
   research might focus on why adults view teens so harshly and deny them
   the right to govern their own actions.

AB This research among a sample of 1,915 Mississippi adolescents investigated whether lonely adolescents who use illicit substances were at increased risk of hopelessness. Relative risk of scoring within the severe hopelessness range was 6.9 for non-substance users who were lonely and 4.2 for substance users who were not lonely. Yet, relative risk for severe hopelessness in substance-using lonely adolescents was 25.2. Lonely, substance-using adolescents were 25 times more likely to be severely hopeless than the reference group composed of non-substance using, not-lonely adolescents. Lonely adolescents who get drunk also were 15.9 times more likely to be severely hopeless than the reference group. Because hopelessness often is an indicator of suicidal behavior, these results may have important implications for school health adolescent suicide prevention efforts.

AB A school-based social influences approach to alcohol education was tested among Norwegian 8th grade lower secondary school students. The goal of the programme was to delay onset and minimize involvement in use of alcohol among the participants. 15 schools were randomly assigned to peer-led education, teacher-led education or a control condition. The programme focused on the social and environmental influences to drink alcohol, and skills to resist those influences. It consisted of five lessons over two months. Baseline and post-test data measured alcohol-use, knowledge, attitudes, skills, friends' drinking, and intentions to drink alcohol in the future. Data were collected immediately prior to and following the educational programme. The data indicate that peer-led education appears to be efficacious in reducing alcohol use and intention to use alcohol. There was no intervention effect of the peer-led programme for knowledge, attitudes or skills. There was no intervention effect for the teacher-led education.

Two examples from Victoria, Australia, show how coordinated legislative and voluntary sector action can have a substantial impact on public behaviour. The introduction and enforcement of strict drink-driving laws and speed limits backed up by forceful television advertisements produced a large reduction in deaths from road traffic accidents, the death rate in relation to the number of vehicles in 1991 being among the lowest in the world. Smoking has also declined in parallel with a phased ban on advertising and use of taxes from tobacco sales to replace tobacco sponsorship of sports and arts and fund health promotion.

AB Alcoholic beverage advertising in Australia is allowed provided it conforms with a Code of Conduct approved by the Media Council of Australia (a collective of media proprietors). This system, known as self-regulation, has come under increasing critical scrutiny. It is argued from a systemic perspective that research has been one factor that has led to this increased scrutiny of alcoholic beverage advertising. Important other factors include the advent of the Australian National Campaign against Drug Abuse (which crucially included alcohol on its agenda), some erosion of the alcoholic beverage producers political status, declining per capita consumption, and an increase in media reporting on alcohol and drug issues. By examination of five research reports recently released on alcohol advertising it is argued that, in order to influence policy makers in an area where there is substantial opposition to change, research must be deftly marketed, contain information of political relevance, such as opinion poll material, and be used as a lobbying tool. The role of researchers in this process is considered.

AB This paper describes the Under Pressure Program, an innovative communication-centered approach designed to involve Chicago public junior and senior high school students in considering the problems and prevention of adolescent substance abuse. The centerpiece of the program is a 30-minute live musical play, Captain Clean, which incorporates extensive postperformance dialogue and role play to explore the pressures and feelings of adolescents regarding substance abuse. This unique blend of live entertainment and applied learning techniques enables adolescents to understand the pressures they face and teaches them to make responsible choices, in addition to serving as a vehicle for effective school and community substance abuse intervention. By going beyond the 60-second "just say no" television and radio campaigns, the Under Pressure Program addresses the underlying causes of adolescent substance abuse. Students are engaged in active participation rather than the traditional "teach and preach." The goals of the program are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of live theatre in preventing and intervening in adolescent substance abuse, and (2) to examine the effectiveness of live theatre, via postperformance dialogue and role playing, in soliciting feedback from adolescents as to their own feelings about substance abuse and using school counselors and other available resources, and to build upon their recommendations for improving substance abuse prevention and intervention programs. The program is targeted at predominantly minority, low-income students who have been identified as "high risk." The Under Pressure format consists of four integral parts: faculty/staff community in-service: theatrical performance (Captain Clean); postperformance dialogue and role play; and student, faculty, counselor, and community follow-up.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has spread widely among injecting drug users (IDUs) in countries to the north and west of the 'Golden Triangle' region of South-East Asia; it is likely to have spread southwards to Malaysia as well. In order to assess HIV seroprevalence among IDUs in north-east Malaysia and describe risk factors for HIV infection in this population, we performed a cross-sectional seroepidemiological study among 210 IDUs recruited at the detoxification ward of the General Hospital in the capital city of the north-eastern Malaysian state, Kelantan. Subjects were sequential entrants to the detoxification ward, interviewed about HIV risk behaviour, and tested for antibody to HIV and to syphilis. Nearly a third (62/210, 30%) of these IDUs were HIV seropositive. Three-quarters (159/210) had travelled to Thailand in the preceding 5 years, of whom 32% (51/159) were HIV seropositive; this was associated with injecting in Thailand, but not with sexual contact there. Of those who had not left Malaysia in the preceding 5 years, 26% (11/43) were HIV seropositive, a rate not significantly different from those who had travelled. Travel within Malaysia was common (144/210, 69%) among IDUs interviewed, as was unsafe injecting and unsafe sexual behaviour (20% had shared injecting equipment and 21% had had unprotected intercourse) in other states. In every locale, rates of unsafe injecting behaviour were high (55% sharing in last month), even among those who knew they were HIV infected, and rates of condom usage were low (93% of 160 sexually active IDUs had never used a condom). Syphilis was not associated with HIV infection, but with contact with Thai prostitutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 
A2 210 intravenous drug users (IVDU) recruited in the detoxification ward
   of the general hospital in the capital city of the northeastern
   Malaysian state of Kelantan were interviewed about their HIV risk
   behavior and tested for antibodies to HIV and syphilis.  The study was
   conducted to assess HIV seroprevalence among IVDUs in northeast Malaysia
   and describe risk factors for HIV infection in that population.  62 of
   the individuals were HIV-seropositive (HIV+).  159 of the 210 had
   travelled to Thailand in the preceding 5 years, of whom 51 were HIV+.
   Their serostatus was associated with injecting in Thailand, but not with
   sexual contact there.  Of the 43 who had not left Malaysia in the
   preceding 5 years, 11 were HIV+; this 26% rate is not significantly
   different from the rate among those who had travelled.  69% of the
   sample had travelled within Malaysia; 20% had shared injecting
   equipment; and 21% had had unprotected sexual intercourse in other
   states.  55% had shared injecting equipment in the previous month, even
   among those who knew they were infected with HIV.  93% of sexually
   active IVDUs had never used a condom.  Syphilis was not associated with
   HIV infection, but with contact with Thai prostitutes.  Multivariate
   analysis found that the major predictors of HIV seropositivity were
   multiple sharing partners, low income, and few years of education. These
   findings support the notion that HIV is widespread among IVDUs in
   northeast Malaysia and that it is associated with low socioeconomic
   status.  HIV is spreading endogenously within Kelantan and probably in
   other states.  The frequent risk behavior in this high prevalence
   population suggests that transmission rates will probably stay high and
   that large-scale prevention efforts are urgently needed.

AB This paper explores differences in adolescents' attitudes, beliefs, and resistance skills regarding sexual behaviors and use of substances in the context of AIDS prevention. A total of 553 7th and 8th grade students completed a self-administered questionnaire as baseline data collection for a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention project. Students' attitudes about sexual behavior and substance use differed markedly. Teens in this sample reported feeling significantly more comfortable discussing substance use with their parents than discussing sex; they also reported that it is easier to say "no" to alcohol or marijuana than to resist pressures to have sex. Furthermore, these young adolescents believed that their parents would be less upset to discover that they were sexually active than to find out they were using drugs. Among students who had ever had sex and who had ever used alcohol, young adolescents indicated that their parents would be much less upset to find out they were having sex than to discover they were smoking, drinking alcohol, or using drugs. Implications of the findings for HIV/AIDS prevention efforts are discussed.

AB A survey of cigarette smoking in Santo Domingo was conducted among residents of 499 households in two neighborhoods. Residents over 14 years old were classified as current smokers (34.6%), former smokers (11.3%), and never smokers (54.1%). Most of the 200 current smokers interviewed (83%) had started smoking by age 20, but over half (59%) were relatively light smokers, consuming < or = 10 cigarettes per day. Remarkably for Latin America, smoking was nearly as common among women (32.9%) as among men (36.3%). Over 90% of the interview subjects disapproved of smoking by adults, the practice being considered undesirable by most because of its effects on health. Most of the adolescents interviewed viewed smoking as a mark of maturity (82.3%) and as "in" among their friends (53.7%). Even though few respondents understood the specific nature of health threats posed by smoking, health was the single most important factor motivating cessation. Most of the current smokers (87.0%) wanted to quit, and over two-thirds (67.5%) reported making at least one serious attempt to do so. Tobacco industry figures show that between 1962 and 1988 the total apparent cigarette consumption of the Dominican Republic rose 3.7-fold. Most of that increase was the result of promotion by Philip Morris, which now dominates the Dominican market. At present cigarettes are heavily advertised without health warnings and are sold to minors without significant restrictions. Such activities should be of particular concern in this and other developing countries with high fertility rates and young populations.

A2 The most common cancer in US women and the 2nd leading cause of cancer
   death is breast cancer.  Between 1980-1987 in the US. age-adjusted
   incidence rates of breast cancer rose rapidly.  They are also rising
   rapidly in several Asian countries (e.g., in Japan) which have the
   lowest incidence rates.  These rapid increases may mean that
   environmental factors are responsible.  Incidence rates rise greatly
   with age until the late 40s.  US women at highest risk of breast cancer
   are Jewish women, urban women, single women, and women living in the
   northern US.  Women at lowest risk include Mormon and Seventh-Day
   Adventist women, Hispanic and Asian women, rural women, women living in
   the southern US, and married women.  Factors that have a relative risk
   greater than 2 are mother and sister with history of breast cancer,
   especially if diagnoses at an early age; atypical epithelial cells in
   nipple aspirate fluid; nodular densities on the mammogram; history of
   cancer in 1 breast; mother or sister with history of breast cancer;
   biopsy-confirmed benign proliferative breast disease; hyperplastic
   epithelial cells without atypia in nipple aspirate fluid; and radiation
   to chest in moderate to high doses.  Ovarian hormones appear to
   stimulate cell division in the breast, thus elevated levels may be risk
   factors.  Exogenous hormones may also increase the risk.  Women are
   exposed to these exogenous hormones through estrogen replacement
   therapy, progestin only pills, oral contraceptives, long-acting
   injectable contraceptives, and diethylstilbestrol.  Postmenopausal
   obesity increases the risk while premenopausal obesity decreases the
   risk.  A high fat diet in childhood and adolescence may increase the
   risk.  Alcohol drinking may also increase the risk.  Older, white, and
   nulliparous women are more likely to have estrogen receptor-positive
   cancers.  Breast cancer in males tends to share the same risk factors as
   well as its own unique factors.  Prevention of postmenopausal obesity is
   the only established primary prevention effort.  Screening is the only
   secondary prevention means.

AB Marketing techniques and tools, imported from the private sector, are increasingly being advocated for their potential value in crafting and disseminating effective social change strategies. This paper describes the field of social marketing as it is used to improve the health of the public. A disciplined process of strategic planning can yield promising new insights into consumer behavior and product design. But the "technology" cannot simply be transferred without some translation to reconcile differences between commercial marketing and public health. 
A2 While the administration of US President Bill Clinton is trying to
   reform the US health care system, less attention is being given to
   changing behavior.  The problems caused by excessive alcohol drinking,
   poor diets, and the use of tobacco products and other harmful substances
   often tend to be more related to a country's health status than are
   acute, short-lived illnesses.  Private sector-derived marketing
   techniques and tools are increasingly being used to create and
   disseminate effective social change strategies.  The authors describe
   how social marketing can be used to improve public health.  They draw
   from information obtained from major textbooks, conference proceedings,
   telephone interviews with more than 30 practitioners and scholars in the
   field, and data on the application of social marketing in maternal and
   child health and nutrition in developing countries, family planning in
   developing countries, the anti-smoking campaign in the US,
   cardiovascular disease risk reduction, and substance abuse prevention
   among adolescents.  Sections consider the historical convergence of
   marketing and health promotion; the essential elements of a social

   social marketing to health; and limitations, caveats, and issues for the

AB The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention's Division of Communications Programs launched its Urban Youth Public Education Campaign in late 1990 to target African American youth in 14 cities with prevention messages about alcohol and other drugs. During the market research phase of the campaign, the Center sought to determine the extent inner city African American children are impacted by alcohol and other drugs and how widespread the use of these substances is among younger children. Is it rampant and universal, as some press accounts have it, or are the images portrayed by the news media, by popular movies, and by other communication outlets fueling harmful stereotypes? The campaign's market research consisted of in-depth reviews of the literature, of personal communications, conference proceedings, grant and contract reports, monographs, newspaper and magazine articles, and of national survey results, and the analysis of findings from focus groups conducted with 143 African American children living in several urban environments. Although information and conclusions gleaned from the market research revealed a longstanding trend of comparatively lower rates of alcohol and drug use by African American youth, also disclosed was a need for an expanded framework to address the problems of substance abuse within the African American community. An expanded framework acknowledges the dimension of substance use and abuse but also addresses three other dimensions--involvement, exposure, and victimization--that unfold as having major significance for this population of youth who live in urban, high-risk environments.

AB The literature on what, when, and how young children learn about alcohol and drinking is critically reviewed and key issues are highlighted. Available evidence points to recognition of alcohol, identification of drinking norms and rules, formation of attitudes toward drinking and drinkers, and appreciation of some of the consequences of alcohol consumption as early as the preschool years. Understanding of drinking motives appears to require a level of cognitive development that is not present until about 10 to 12 years of age, although there is a dearth of research on this probably crucial determinant of later decisions to drink. Among the factors involved in the acquisition of alcohol cognitions and dispositions are observational learning via families, media, and peers as well as personal drinking experience. Salience of alcohol and its management in the child's immediate environment appears to be an important moderator/mediator of learning. Application of relevant theory to understanding the development of the meaning of alcohol and drinking in preadolescent children is seen as underdeveloped at this time. However, there are a number of potentially fruitful avenues to pursue which could have important implications for future education and prevention efforts.

Of these, 39,904 (70.0%) were in both women and heterosexual men reported as injecting drug users (IDUs), 11,823 (20.7%) in men who have sex with men who are also IDUs, 5,305 (9.3%) in sex partners of IDUs, and 1,847 (3.1%) in children whose mothers were either IDUs or sex partners of IDUs. From 1989 to 1990, the increase in the number of United States AIDS cases associated with IDU either directly or indirectly was higher in all regions compared with the Northeast. The highest percentage increases were in the South, U.S. territories, and the North Central. From 1989 to 1990, the percentage of AIDS cases attributed directly to IDU increased in women and men (15.3 and 5.9%, respectively); however, the increase in sex partners of IDUs was much larger (34.5% in men and 29.1% in women). Increases were also higher in sex partners of IDUs than in IDUs when compared by race/ethnicity and by region of residence. Because HIV can spread rapidly among IDUs and their sex partners, there is an immediate need for targeting effective HIV prevention messages to all IDUs and their sex partners in communities with high HIV infection rates.

   NIH acknowledged the fact that most of its research focused on men, and

   nothing had happened, which triggered a legislative initiative mandating
   the inclusion of women into federally funded research.  Another GAO
   analysis ascertained that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was not
   asking gender-specific questions of drug companies prior to their
   marketing drugs.  For example, FDA would never ask about the interaction
   of oral contraceptives or estrogen with any new drugs.  Adolescents have

AB Greenland is a considered high risk area for a self-sustained heterosexual HIV-epidemic due to rather relaxed sexual norms in larger segments of the population and a high incidence of sexual transmitted diseases. However, the prevalence of HIV-positives is still low. As part of a monitoring programme longitudinal studies of young peoples' knowledge and sexual behaviour has been established. This paper presents results from the second survey among all students in vocational training and all 10th grade students in the public schools. Previous studies were performed in 1988 and 1989. The present study which took place in April 1991 involved a total of 1201 students, or about 85% of all students in the target groups (95% among students present on the day of surveying). Data collection was based upon standardized self-administered questionnaires. The study showed better knowledge than previously but no marked change in sexual habits. The age of sexual debut even appeared to be decreasing. More than half reported a sexual debut before the age of 15. More than 20% reported 10 sexual partners or more within the last year. HIV has still not reached the young population in Greenland but when it happens the present sexual behaviour carries a high risk of a self-sustained epidemic. 
A2 Alarming proportions of teenagers in Greenland start to have sex early
   in life, sleep with multiple partners, and do not use condoms regularly.
   There is a rather relaxed attitude toward casual sex among the general
   population in Greenland.  There exists a commensurately high incidence
   of gonorrhea, syphilis, cervical cancer, and other sexually transmitted
   diseases.  8000 new cases of gonorrhea were diagnosed in 1987, but only
   2000 new cases have been diagnosed annually since 1990.  This latter
   incidence is still high for the total population of 55,000 which resides
   in scattered settlements along the west coast of the protectorate.
   Greenland is at high risk for a heterosexual HIV epidemic.  Thus far,
   Greenland has benefited by a late introduction of HIV to the society,
   lack of drug abuse, few opportunities for homosexual contacts, good
   communication and information systems, good schools, and good health
   care.  As of September 1991, 32 HIV-seropositives had been identified
   from a serosampled population of 18,000; 11 of the positives were
   female.  Studies of youth's knowledge and sexual behavior were conducted
   in 1988 and 1989.  This repeat study surveyed all students in vocational
   training and all 10th graders in public schools in April 1991 through
   self-administered questionnaires.  The group of 1201 student respondents
   represents 85% of all individuals in the target groups.  It should be
   pointed out that 10th grade is the last mandatory year of the elementary
   school system in Greenland and that 461 respondents were under age 18
   and 740 were 18 years or older.  83% had had their sexual debut.  Among
   the sexually experienced, 54% reported first having sex before the age
   of 15 years.  17% of males and 11% of females reported having more than
   10 sex partners in the previous year.  26% of males and 42% of females
   reported more than 15 intercourses per month.  Consistent or most of the
   time use of condoms was, however, reported by only 29% of males and 24%
   of females.  Compared to earlier surveys, the age of sexual initiation
   declined and respondents reported both a greater number of sex partners
   and a higher frequency of sexual intercourse.  Denmark, yet residing in
   Greenland.  These findings indicate that while 5 years of intensive
   education and prevention campaigns have succeeded in improving health
   personnel, teacher, and student knowledge about AIDS, no marked change
   has taken place in the sexual habits of the young.  It is, therefore,
   concluded that an AIDS prevention campaign must not be based exclusively
   upon the promotion of condom use, but should aim to stop the decline in
   age of sexual debut, reduce the degree of excessive sexual promiscuity,
   and address alcohol abuse.  These steps must be taken now to had off a
   self-sustained HIV epidemic as the prevalence of HIV grows in this
   population.

AB Using a new technique for tracing the sequence of use over time, this study examined the pattern of drug involvement among 4,145 West Coast adolescents over the 4-year span from Grades 7-10. During the period covered, the mid- to late 1980s, we found no evidence that cocaine has become a gateway drug. However, the data provided some support for treating cocaine initiation as a separate stage that precedes the onset of hard drugs other than pills. The analysis also showed that increased involvement with legal drugs constitutes an important step in the transition to hard drug use for most adolescents. Weekly alcohol use followed marijuana use and preceded use of all other illicit drugs for Hispanic, White, and Black youth. However, it followed use of hard drugs for Asians. Weekly smoking formed a distinct stage between initial use of pills and other hard drugs for non-Hispanic Whites. The results underscore the importance of prevention efforts aimed at curbing the transition to regular use of alcohol and cigarettes, as well as their initial use.

AB The rate of fatal suicide attempts among males rose dramatically between 1950 and 1980 and has continued to rise significantly during the 1980s among 15- to 19-year-old youth. Nonfatal suicide attempts, although far more frequent among females, appear to share similar risk factors with completed suicide. The most important preconditional risk factors for both fatal and nonfatal suicide attempts are a history of a previous attempt, major affective and conduct disorders, chronic substance abuse, and a history of personal losses, including experience of suicide attempts by peers and family members. Risk factors for the acute precipitation of an attempt include the acute disruption of an interpersonal relationship, alcohol intoxication, and access to firearms. Preventive efforts can be enhanced by pediatricians both in the office and the community. Clinical case finding of individuals thought to be at high risk will continue to identify some potential victims. Families with household firearms should be counseled regarding the risk of firearm injury and death, particularly in a home with an individual with other risk factors. Community campaigns to improve the mental health of youth and to reduce firearm ownership may hold future promise for the reduction of the unacceptable morbidity and mortality associated with adolescent suicide attempts.

AB The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a data set based on telephone surveys that have been conducted by States in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control, has been used to estimate the prevalence of behavioral risk factors for adults in the United States so health objectives can be set and progress towards accomplishing them measured. Data for adult American Indians in this regard have not been available generally. The use of these data to estimate behavioral risk prevalence for American Indians by geographic region was examined and the results compared with those for white Americans. In addition, data from the system were compared with other data sets, including the results of selected surveys in American Indian communities, to explore the validity of the system as a tool for evaluating the behavioral risks of Indians. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for the period 1985 to 1988 were used. During this period, the 1,055 American Indian respondents constituted 0.63 percent of those responding under the system and 0.70 percent of the population of the participating States. Separate (sex-specific) behavioral risk prevalence estimates were derived for Indians and whites for four geographic regions--Southwest, Plains, West Coast, and Other States. The system's behavioral risk estimates for the Plains region were compared with available data from behavioral risk surveys done in three American Indian communities in Montana (Blackfeet, Fort Peck, and Great Falls) from 1987 to 1989. The behavioral risk factors compared include use of automobile seatbelts, current smoking, current use of smokeless tobacco, heavy drinking, drinking and driving, overweight, hypertension, and sedentary lifestyle. Although large regional differences in the prevalence of these risk factors were found, the magnitude and direction of the differences are frequently similar among American Indians and whites living in the same geographic regions. The findings from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System among American Indians are largely consistent within dependently collected data from more resource intensive household surveys, at least when surveys in Montana are compared with system data from the Plains. These data are generally consistent with other epidemiologic studies.When they are used in conjunction with community-specific surveys, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data may be useful for monitoring the progress of American Indians towards the Year 2000 national health objectives. The value of the surveillance system for monitoring trends in behavioral risk factors among Indians would be enhanced if States attempted to over sample regions (such as Indian reservations) with a high proportion of Indian residents. It appears that aggressive health promotion and disease prevention efforts will be needed if these objectives are to be achieved.

AB The social influence models do provide some optimism for primary prevention efforts. Prevention programs appear most effective when 1) the target behavior of the intervention has received increasing societal disapproval (such as cigarette smoking), 2) multiple years of behavioral health education are planned, and 3) community-wide involvement or mass media complement a school-based peer-led program (45,46). Short-term programs and those involving alcohol use have had less favorable outcomes. Future research in primary prevention should address concerns of high-risk groups and high-risk countries, such as lower income populations in the United States or countries that have large adolescent homeless populations. The utilization of adolescent leaders for program dissemination might be particularly critical in these settings. A second major and global concern should focus upon alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. In many communities adolescent alcohol use is normative and even adult supported. Thus, young people are getting quite inconsistent messages on alcohol from their schools, from TV, from peers, and from parents. This inconsistency may translate into many tragic and avoidable deaths for young people. Clearly, in the area of alcohol-related problems, community-wide involvement may be necessary. A third direction for prevention research should involve issues of norms, access, and enforcement including policy interventions, such as involve the availability of cigarette vending machines or the ease of under-age buying or levels of taxation. These methods affect adolescents more acutely since their financial resources, for the most part, are more limited. These policy level methods also signify to adolescents what adults consider appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB A comparative study between two distinctive groups of children documenting morbidity, physical growth and psychopathology was completed. 186 children belonging to a marginal and deprived suburban community from Valencia was defined as a experimental group (EG). 100 randomly selected children attending the emergency room of La Fe Children's Hospital was defined as control group (CG). Significant statistical differences were found between the two groups in: type and quality of prenatal care, vaccinations, low stature, depressive symptomatology and bizarre personality and behaviour. No significant statistical differences were found between the two groups in: breast feeding patterns, incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, weight, prematurity, low birth weight, caries and anxiety. 
A2 Aspects of the morbidity, growth, and psychopathology were studied in
   186 children living in the barrio of La Coma, a marginal urban zone of
   Valencia.  The children were compared with 100 controls randomly
   selected at the emergency room of the La Fe Children's Hospital.  The
   barrio of La Coma contained around 5000 low income and disadvantaged
   residents.  46% of the population was under 16 and 20% were gypsies.
   Parents or grandparents of the 186 subjects and 100 controls were
   interviewed in 1991.  2 groups of 55 subjects and 100 controls aged 12-
   14 were formed for the study of mental health.  2 questionnaire scales
   measuring children's anxiety levels were used, the "State Trait Anxiety
   Inventory of Children" and the "Children's Anxiety Scale".  The
   "Children's Depression" questionnaire scale was used to measure symptoms
   of depression, and a scale test was used to obtain personality profiles.
   Both groups were similar in age, sex, and birth place.  The control
   group had a significantly higher average duration of residence in the
   current location, 14.46 years vs. 3.86 years.  The subject children were
   significantly less likely to have health coverage and more likely to
   live in female-headed households.  The average educational level of the
   subject children's parents was lower, they were less likely to own their
   homes, and they had significantly fewer consumer goods such as
   telephones, automobiles, and televisions.  None of the control children
   lived in households affected by drug addiction, prostitution,
   delinquency, or alcoholism, but 13.2% of subject children had at least
   one family member with one of these conditions.  Control children were
   significantly more likely to have received prenatal care and to be
   completely vaccinated.  No significant differences were observed in
   rates of prematurity or low birth weight, initiation of breastfeeding,
   dental caries in children over 15 months old, incidence of respiratory
   or gastrointestinal illness, weight, or anxiety.  Control children were
   significantly taller than subject children.  Subject children had
   significantly higher rates of depression and of personality disorders
   and overall psychological pathology.

A2 Previously divorced and remarried couples have a higher probability of
   divorce and decline in marital quality.  Models which have explained
   this behavior focus on:  willingness to leave marriage; selection;
   socioeconomic status; the remarriage market; and incomplete marriages.
   Each model is examined among a population of marrieds and remarrieds to
   distinguish attributes and the extent to which these attributes increase
   the probability of decline in marital quality or divorce.  Data were
   obtained from a sample of 2033 marrieds  55 years old who were
   interviewed over the telephone in 1980, 1983, and 1988 in the Marital
   Instability Over the Life Course Study.  Incomplete marriage was
   measured by whether and to what extent parents or parents-in-law made
   contact and the number of relatives that party was close to. Willingness
   to leave was based on attitudes to divorce and the ability to handle
   emotion and financial affairs if the marriage ended. Selection referred
   to poor marriage material (drugs or alcohol, criminal conduct,
   mismanagement of money, immature behavior.  Socioeconomic status was
   reflected in occupational status, educational levels, and income.  The
   marriage market was a measure of age, education, and religious
   differences.  Marital quality was examined in terms of happiness,
   interaction, disagreement, and divorce proneness.  Multiple
   classification analysis was used to compare attributes by marital
   history.  The methods of Kessler and Greenberg were used to examine
   changes in marital quality over time in first time marriages and
   remarriages.  The results indicate that individuals in remarriages have
   relationships with attributes which potentially lower marital quality
   and increase the probability of divorce.  When both individuals have
   prior marriage and divorce experience, there is even lower social
   integration, greater willingness to leave marriage, higher probability
   of marrying as a teen, lower socioeconomic status, and greater
   likelihood of age differences.  Remarriage variables and marital quality
   variables both showed linear relationships.  Remarriage variables and
   marital quality variables both showed linear relationships.  In the
   cross sectional analysis of the 1980 data there is a statistically
   significant relationship with attributes which potentially lower marital
   quality in 1980 indicates remarried persons are more prone to lower
   marital quality than people in first marriages.

This study is a breakthrough in the Christian, Druze, and Moslem sectors, since it is the first project in the "alcohol domain" among high school students from those sectors. The article presents the results concerning Christian, Druze, and Moslem adolescents' attitudes toward magazine alcohol advertisements. The results have implications for prevention efforts among adolescents from those three religions.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate alcohol use and abuse among young offenders.; DESIGN: A questionnaire survey.; SETTING: Two centres in Adelaide used for the custodial care of young offenders.; PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive admissions involving stays of more than 24 hours. All subjects were adjudicated delinquents. Usable questionnaires were obtained from 197 of the 207 subjects (95.2%) approached.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Scale (AAIS).; RESULTS: Most respondents (72.1%) obtained AAIS scores that fell into the problem drinking range, with 24.4% scoring in the "alcoholic-like" drinker category. Comparison with a South Australian student sample indicated much higher rates of alcohol consumption among the young offenders. The majority (56.9%) had been drinking at the time of their last offence.; CONCLUSIONS: Offending and the use of alcohol by adolescents are closely linked. Young offenders are at an extremely high risk of alcohol abuse. It is recommended that greater treatment and prevention efforts be directed toward this group.

A2 Improved family and community support would prevent many youth in
   Nigeria from risk behavior including drinking alcohol, smoking, and
   using illicit drugs.  In Rivers State, 70% of secondary students have
   had at least 1 alcoholic drink.  Further, in Bendel State, 13% of 15-19
   year olds in the coastal region drink alcohol compared with 75% of those
   in the hinterland.  Since alcohol affects good judgment skills, this
   behavior is especially risky during rituals and social activities and
   causes accidents.  Youth who drink are likely to have unplanned and
   unprotected sexual intercourse.  Drinking during pregnancy is associated
   with miscarriages, low birth weight, and birth defects.  Despite the
   problems with youth and drinking, Nigeria does not have law restricting
   sales of alcohol to youth.  In Nigeria smoking was once predominantly a
   male habit but is now increasing quickly among women.  Most smokers 1st
   begin their habit when 18 years old.  Even thought he Nigerian
   government has restricted smoking in public places, it has not yet been
   effective.  Smoking has numerous negative effects such as lung cancer,
   other cancers, shorter life spans, low birth weight, prematurity, higher
   perinatal mortality, and more labor complications.  Moreover the tobacco
   and alcohol companies advertise widely using ingenious and persuasive
   promotions.  Youth are especially vulnerable to these slick promotions. 
   Cannabis remains the most common illegal drug.  Heroin use is growing
   among urban adolescents in Nigeria, however.  Nigeria also serves as a
   transhipment point for drugs to the US as well as a consumption point. 
   Drug use results in rising numbers of patients in mental hospitals and
   treatment centers.  A particular concern of drug use is transmission of
   HIV and hepatitis B via needles.  Smokers and alcohol drinkers are
   likely to also be drug users.  Families, government, and community
   organizations need to collaborate to prevent these risk behaviors among
   youth.

AB INTRODUCTION: After the onset of the HIV epidemic, the hope arose that the "harm reduction" approach of the Amsterdam "low-threshold" methadone programs would have a function in controlling the spread of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs).; METHODS: To find evidence for this assumption, 386 IDUs participating in an HIV study between 1985 and 1989 were studied. Long-term regular participants in low-threshold methadone programs were compared with short-term and/or irregular participants.; RESULTS: Controlling for possible confounders, long-term regular participants had a slightly increased but not statistically significant risk of being HIV infected. With regard to current drug use, they injected daily and shared needles as often as did short-term and/or irregular participants.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the Amsterdam low-threshold methadone programs fail to diminish HIV risk behavior. If these programs want to have a positive effect on the spread of HIV, expansion of existing HIV prevention efforts, an increase in the daily methadone dose level, and measures to enforce regular attendance may be required.

AB Crimes of violence are recorded increasingly frequently, including those involving health professionals. We reviewed records of violent incidents kept for a major Accident and Emergency Department over a ten-year period. Details were recorded in a Violent Incident Book by all grades of A/E staff, and separate records were kept by hospital security officers. A total of 407 incidents were recorded. Numbers, rank and sex of staff assaulted, types of assault, injuries received, weapons used and characteristics and disposal of perpetrators were recorded. Many were young males who had been drinking: others were regular attenders, of whom three subsequently died and one convicted of murder. Nurses and male doctors appeared to be at the greatest risk of assault and receptionists at the least risk. Recording of violent incidents and subsequent prosecution seemed inconsistent, and may have reflected the lack of a code of practice in this area. Suggestions are made about preventing, predicting and dealing with violence, and its aftermath, in the A and E department, including the use of security officers and closed circuit television, waiting room design, the recognition of body language and signs of alcohol or substance intoxication. The importance of staff support after an assault is emphasized, including immediate and long-term counselling, provision of legal advice, criminal or civil court action, victim support schemes and the workings of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Free legal advice for staff assaulted at work should be included in the terms of service of NHS staff.

Of the 106 dancers who completed the questionnaire, 71% participated in ballet, 60% in jazz, and 74% in modern dance; 31% participated in all three types of dance. The body mass index was similar for all types of dancers. More than half (60%) of the dancers used vitamin and mineral supplements, and 18% of the females reported irregular menstruation. Wide ranges existed in intake of foods from each of four food groups, caffeine, and alcohol. Printed media (magazines and books) were the primary sources of nutrition information. Dietitians may encounter many types of dancers and should be aware that dancers involved in ballet and other types of dance may have dietary practices that could improve with nutrition education and counseling.

A2 Data on 74 pathologically confirmed cases of liver cancer among blacks
   and whites living in Los Angeles County, California were compared with
   162 matched controls.  The study was limited to only people with no
   hepatitis infection and to non-Asians.  The risk of liver cancer for
   women who have used OCs for 5 years was 5.5 times higher than that for
   women who had never used OCs.  This risk was 3 times higher for women
   who had ever used OCs.  The data for women who were in their
   reproductive years when OCs 1st entered the market in the 1960s showed
   that the risk for 5 years of OC use increased to almost 30 times that of
   women who had never used OCs.  Even though estrogens were presumed to be
   the risk factor since they induce liver cancer in animals, no
   significant association was found between estrogens used in estrogen
   replacement therapy and liver cancer.  Overall, diabetics were at 3.3
   times the risk for liver cancer compared with nondiabetics.  People who
   had diabetes for at least 10 years had 4.3 times the risk and those
   dependent on insulin injections had 18.5 times the risk.  Cigarette
   smokers had a 2.1 times greater risk of liver cancer than nonsmokers.
   Most of the women did not drink heavily which showed the independent
   effect of cigarette smoking.  As of December 1991, these data
   represented the best data on OCs and cigarette smoking to date.  The
   risk for heavy drinkers of alcohol (80g of alcohol/day=9 cans of beer, 9
   glasses of wine, or 9 shots of spirits) was 4.7 times the risk of
   nondrinkers or light drinkers.  It is concluded that alcohol and/or
   cigarettes caused 56% of liver cancer cases in men and that cigarettes
   and/or OCs caused 54% of liver cancer cases in women.

AB An increase in neonatal gonococcal infections was recorded in Florida between 1984 and 1988. By reviewing Florida sexually transmitted disease surveillance case records between 1984 and 1989, 68 cases of neonatal gonococcal infections were identified state-wide. Those 68 cases included 55 (81%) cases of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, 4 genital infections, 1 nasal infection, 1 ear infection, 1 skin infection, and 1 scalp infection. At birth, positive culture results were demonstrated in 3 gastric and 2 respiratory aspirate cultures. A case-control study using birth certificates as the source of information showed that mothers of infected infants were more likely to be younger, black (odds ratio [OR] = 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3, 16.2), and less educated (less than a high school education, OR = 2.9, CI 1.0,8.8) in comparison to mothers of control subjects. Although mothers of infected newborns were less likely to have received prenatal care than were mothers of control subjects, this difference was not statistically significant. Maternal substance abuse was documented among 19% of the mothers of the infected infants. The rate of clinical gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum in Florida hospitals from which cases had been reported was 1.7 per 10,000 live births, and tended to be higher in hospitals using erythromycin than in hospitals using any other prophylactic eye treatment. This study suggests that the rate of neonatal gonococcal infection, in particular ophthalmia neonatorum, may have increased in Florida among high-risk populations between 1984 and 1988, and underscores the need for targeted prevention efforts and surveillance.

AB Children responsible for their own survival exist in all countries. Despite social and cultural differences between street youth in developing countries versus homeless youth in developed countries, the predictors and correlates of homelessness are similar among youth. The AIDS pandemic is inextricably linked to homelessness and is a particularly devastating threat to the welfare of the world's disenfranchised youth, as they are continually forced into multiple HIV-related high risk situations and behaviors. Specific recommendations regarding clinical care, prevention programs, research, and the implications for policy and legislative action are discussed in relation to reducing the incidences and impact of HIV. For the world's populations of street children the issue of globally providing AIDS education and prevention within the context of health care services is emphasized, particularly by the promotion and training of physicians and other health professionals in street-based care. 
A2 Homelessness among youth is universal, but is particularly great in
   developing countries.  Children advocates have categorized youth with no
   fixed address in the US as runaways, throwaways, homeless youth, system
   youth, and street youth.  About 50% of such youth are system youth who
   have lived in institutions or foster homes.  Around 21% are children
   whose parents forced them out of the home.  60% have been sexually
   abused at home.  Homeless youth are at higher risk of HIV than those who
   have a home.  This risk comes primarily from unprotected, often
   homosexual, intercourse and iv drug use.  Some subgroups of street youth
   in Brazil have an HIV prevalence rate of 35%.  Street youth take on
   these risky behaviors to just survive.  PAHO, WHO, and UNICEF have
   placed HIV prevention among teenagers as a top priority.  VArious
   countries have hosted national and international conferences on this
   topic.  In June 1990, the 1st International Conference on AIDS and
   Homeless Youth took place in San Francisco to gather international
   community specialists from 32 countries to respond to the AIDS crisis.
   Many recommendations came from this conference.  1st, all nations and
   international bodies must recognize and enforce the rights of children.
   Street youth must have access to comprehensive health care (mental
   health care, treatment for substance abuse, bereavement services, and
   HIV testing and counseling).  Health workers must be prepared to provide
   street-based services.  HIV prevention messages based in reality must
   reach these children.  Research needs include epidemiologic data,
   cross-national and cross-cultural trends, ethnographic descriptions, and
   high risk behaviors.  The next international conference is planned for
   September 1992 in Brazil and will include street youths as delegates.

AB Two-thirds of a sample of 535 young women from the state of Washington who became pregnant as adolescents had been sexually abused: Fifty-five percent had been molested, 42 percent had been victims of attempted rape and 44 percent had been raped. Compared with adolescent women who became pregnant but had not been abused, sexually victimized teenagers began intercourse a year earlier, were more likely to have used drugs and alcohol and were less likely to practice contraception. The abused adolescents were also more likely to have been hit, slapped or beaten by a partner and to have exchanged sex for money, drugs or a place to stay. Young women in the abused group were also more likely to report that their own children had been abused or had been taken from them by Child Protective Services. 
A2 The study of child abuse as a factor in teenage pregnancy is part of a
   3-phase effort begun in 1988 with a baseline survey of 535 young women
   in Washington state.  Results of the follow-up survey and a review of
   Child Protective Service case records and focus group interviews will be
   forthcoming.  The sample was drawn from 35 pregnant and parenting
   adolescent program sites in 9 counties of which 4 included urban areas
   and 5 were rural.  25 school-based programs were involved as well as 3
   Northwest American Indian tribal organizations.  93% were 17 years at
   their 1st pregnancy.  Since 50% of the 15,581 pregnant women and 8057
   live births in 1989 were involved in school or community programs, the

   with 9390 participating; the concern about the difficulty of obtaining
   parental permission was unfounded.  The survey questionnaire was
   concerned with demographic characteristics, family background, pregnancy
   and parenting history, sexual histories, and behavioral indicators of
   sexual victimization and physical maltreatment and neglect.  The results
   are discussed under the following topic headings:  demographic measures,
   site comparisons, school status comparisons, 1st intercourse, 1st
   pregnancy, physical abuse (sexual victimization and other violence),
   prepregnancy abuse, prevalence of maltreatment, and abuse by teenage
   parents.  An unanticipated finding was that 66% were sexually victimized
   overall, and 62% prior to the 1st pregnancy.  Sexual activity began at
   an earlier age than other sexually active adolescents, i.e., 45% of
   15-19 year old have had premarital sexual intercourse, with a mean of
   16.2 years vs. the mean age of nonvoluntary intercourse of 13.8 years,
   and of nonabused women of 14.5 years vs. abused women of 14.2 years. 
   There was also less contraceptive use, i.e., 28% of the sample vs. 49%
   of sexually active 15-19 year old women.  Among the finding are that
   abused women are 3 times more likely than nonabused women to have
   children that are maltreated and are more likely to have repeat
   pregnancies.  Sexual victimization may account for the continuing high
   rates of teenage pregnancies, and prevention efforts need to include
   interventions for this effect.

AB During the period 1980 through 1989 a total of 1029 cases of fatal poisoning (638 men and 391 women) were examined at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark. In 68% of the cases death had been caused by drugs, whereas acute alcohol poisoning and carbon monoxide accounted for 15% and 14% of the cases, respectively. Alcohol was detected in more than half of the 1029 fatal poisoning cases, and in 42% of all cases the blood alcohol concentration was above 0.8 g/kg. In 57% of the cases death was categorized as accidental, only in 31% of the cases as suicide. Accidental deaths were especially predominant amongst drug and/or alcohol abusers. Propoxyphene was the drug found to have caused most fatal poisonings during the decade (30% of the drug-related deaths). Most of the propoxyphene-related deaths occurred during the early and mid-eighties. Barbiturate poisonings were quite frequent during the first half of the eighties. However, the number of deaths caused by barbiturates decreased significantly after 1986, when most barbiturates were withdrawn from the market. The number of deaths caused by narcotics and analgesics increased during the survey period, while no specific tendency was observed concerning antidepressants.

AB The relationship of age at first injection and HIV risk was explored in a nonblinded HIV seroprevalence study of intravenous drug users (IVDUs) admitted to methadone treatment in seven United States cities between February 1987 and June 1989. Comparisons were made of IVDUs who began injecting as adolescents, young adults, and adults in terms of drug use and sexual HIV risk behaviors and HIV serostatus. Early injectors consistently reported higher levels of drug-using risk behaviors (e.g., frequency of injection, frequency of needle sharing, and use of shooting galleries), and were more likely to be HIV seropositive. Among females, early injectors were also more likely to report sexual risk behaviors (e.g., multiple sex partners, prostitution). The relationship of age at first injection with selected risk behaviors and HIV serostatus was independent of subjects' age at interview, gender, and race/ethnicity. This study suggests that adolescent injectors are an important target group for HIV prevention efforts.

AB Recent studies indicate that 15-22% of American children and adolescents suffer from diagnosable mental disorders. Researchers estimate that 25-50% engage in risk behaviors for negative health and behavior outcomes, such as drug abuse, unwanted pregnancy, AIDS, delinquency, and school dropout. The prevalence of problem behaviors, as well as current social trends, demands that effective primary prevention programs be developed and disseminated. This article reviews successful family-, school-, and community-based prevention efforts aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of children's psychosocial problems. High-quality, comprehensive, competence-promotion programs that focus on both children and their socializing environments represent the state of the art in prevention. Establishing enduring, effective preventive interventions requires increased attention to program design, implementation, and institutionalization.

AB A follow-up study explored the prevalence of behavioral risk factors for HIV infection in a population of college students. Two hundred forty-three single students ranging in age from 17 to 24 years who identified themselves as heterosexual completed questionnaires related to planned and unplanned sexual intercourse and such other factors as alcohol and nonprescription drug use that might increase the risk of HIV infection. Forty-seven percent of the men and 57% of the women stated that they had had sexual intercourse from 1 to 5 times primarily because they were intoxicated, a phenomenon that increased with age until only 19% of those over 21 had never had sex because of intoxication. Seventeen percent of the sexually active men and 21% of the women said that they had used condoms. Nineteen percent of the men and 33% of the women acknowledged consenting to sexual intercourse because they felt awkward in refusing. The dangerous interaction between alcohol use and high-risk sexual activities suggested that college HIV prevention efforts should make the connection between the two risk factors explicit.

AB Earlier findings have suggested that marriage may provide protection from a variety of physical and psychological problems. In particular, numerous studies have demonstrated a consistent relationship between marital status and alcohol use. To examine this relationship more carefully, we performed a longitudinal analysis of data collected on the Youth Cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience. Four marital transition groups were constructed based upon marital status across a 3-year period: stably single, married year 3, married year 2 and stably married. Results of repeated-measures MANCOVAS performed on alcohol-use patterns across time as a function of marital-transition group supported the notion that individuals begin moderating their alcohol consumption prior to their actual transition to married status with the trend continuing into the first year of marriage. The data further suggested that this decline in alcohol use stabilizes shortly thereafter, apparently within 1 year after marriage.

Of a general sample of 2763 students, 932 Moslem and 215 Druze adolescents were drawn from junior and senior high schools in a Druze village, several Moslem villages, an Arab town, and a mixed Arab-Jewish town. This is the first epidemiological study among students from those sectors in Israel. Involvement with alcohol was greatest among Druze males, lower by Moslem males from an Arab town and Moslem villages, and lowest by Moslem students in a mixed Arab-Jewish town. Druze students reported a higher rate of father's drinking than Moslem students did. Prevention efforts among these populations are discussed.

The presentation was conducted over three (consecutive) days with 10th and 11th grade students in a rural area of South Carolina. The professionally produced announcements focused on drinking and driving. 52 subjects were assigned by classroom to either of two treatment groups or a control condition. Both treatment groups received the educational presentation but differed in that Group 2 was also exposed to the videotaped announcements. Effects of exposure were evaluated in separate measures of knowledge, attitudes, and alcohol involvement, using a pre-posttest design, with a 1-mo. follow-up. Analysis showed an effect of over-all program on knowledge at follow-up, but none on attitudes or alcohol involvement. These findings and their implications are discussed in the context of previous evaluations of alcohol education programs and media efforts.

AB In a longitudinal study of 1230 people aged 13-18 years from the Greater Oslo Area, the past-year prevalence of anxiolytic or hypnotic use was 10%, which is higher than previously reported. The majority gave therapeutic reasons as a motive for using these drugs. However, most of the use was unprescribed. The parents, and especially the mother, were the most important suppliers. A minority gave intoxication as a motive for using these drugs. In this group, the suppliers were mainly peers and the illegal market. Neither the unprescribed nor the prescribed therapeutic use show any association with use of drugs such as alcohol and cannabis. There is, however, a strong association between the unprescribed use of benzodiazepines by young people and by their parents. This suggests a pattern of learning and role modelling, which must be regarded as problematic for public health policy. Those who use the drugs to become intoxicated have particularly poor mental health, and they use many other drugs as well. This group probably runs a special risk of developing more serious drug abuse.

AB HIV-1 disease has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity for fewer than 10 years. Yet during that time, the virus has spread around the world and affects people of virtually all ages, genders, sexual behaviors, and geographic regions. In the United States, there have been more than 140,000 individuals diagnosed with AIDS, the clinical end stage of HIV-1 disease, and it is projected that AIDS incidence will accelerate through at least 1993. In the early years of the infection epidemic in the United States, the virus spread rapidly and insidiously, predominantly among homosexual men, intravenous drug users, people with hemophilia, and recipients of infected blood products. Since then, the epidemic has been propagated concurrently with epidemics of drug use (intravenous and noninjectable) and sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis. Since its beginning, HIV-1 has disproportionately affected members of racial and ethnic minorities, particularly in large cities, where transmission takes place sexually, parenterally, and perinatally. The epidemic of HIV-1 has spread outside of traditional urban epicenters and is more significantly affecting adolescents, women, and heterosexuals. There is a great need for renewed and refocused infection-prevention efforts. Projections of resource and medical service needs should be based on up-to-date and accurate assessments of infection epidemic parameters, including infection prevalence, incidence, and acceleration (changes in epidemic velocity over time) rates.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and pattern of cocaine use among young Sydney adults interviewed during a study of the "market position" of cocaine.; DESIGN: A telephone survey of young Sydney adults.; PARTICIPANTS: A total of 499 young Sydney men and women aged between 14 and 35 were selected to ensure a sample of 300 persons who used alcohol and tobacco at least weekly, and who had been offered or had tried at least one illicit drug.; MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: These were the prevalence of having ever used cocaine, the frequency of cocaine use, the prevalence of daily alcohol and tobacco use, and of ever having tried marijuana, sedatives, designer drugs, amphetamines and heroin.; RESULTS: Thirteen per cent of the sample (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-16%) had ever tried cocaine, of whom only 20% (CI, 15%-25%) were current users. Cocaine users were distinguished from non-users by being more likely to be daily users of tobacco (odds ratio, 2.1; CI, 1.3-3.6) and alcohol (odds ratio, 3.0; CI, 1.7-5.6), and to have tried marijuana (odds ratio, 7.1; CI, 3.2-15.9), sedatives (odds ratio, 11.4; CI, 6.4-20.7), designer drugs (odds ratio, 17.2; CI, 9.2-32.2), amphetamines (odds ratio, 27.1; CI, 14.3-51.3), and heroin (odds ratio, 36.5; CI, 14.0-94.9). The odds of having tried cocaine increased with the number of different types of illicit drugs that the person had tried.; CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ever having tried cocaine was low among a sample of young adults selected to ensure an over-representation of illicit drug users. Cocaine users were more likely to have experimented with a variety of different types of illicit drugs. Only a minority of those who had ever tried cocaine were current users.

AB A sample of high school students in grade 9 and 13 (14-15 and 18-19 years old respectively) in Brescia, North Italy, were interviewed to assess the relationship of smoking habit with attitudes, knowledge, behavioural and socio-environmental factors among adolescents. The associations between smoking habit, considered as a dichotomous response variable, and the other variables were assessed by estimating the prevalence ratios. The following variables were found to be associated with the students' smoking: best friend and/or partner smoking, sibling smoking, alcohol drinking and the students' judgement of the health risks of smoking. Although no conclusion can be drawn on the causal relationship of these associations due to the cross-sectional design of the survey, these findings suggest that social environment influences adolescents' smoking more than family life does. Furthermore, the knowledge of the health risks of smoking was not associated to adolescents' smoking.

AB This study examined the willingness of drinkers to participate in alcohol interventions designed to cut down or stop alcohol use by degree of service-provider contact. One hundred fifty-six university students and staff who attended a campus health fair participated in an alcohol survey. Of the college drinkers, 73.7% reported they were willing to participate in one or more alcohol interventions with minimal provider contact, compared with 48.5% who said they would participate in programs with high provider contact. Respondents preferred minimal-contact strategies (use of nonalcoholic or low-alcohol beverages, information pamphlets, cash awards, television programs, and mailed instructions) to high-contact approaches. Men were significantly more willing (ps less than .05) than women to participate in nearly half (11 to 21) of the alcohol interventions. Three measures indicative of motivation to control drinking were significantly associated with greater willingness to participate in nearly all strategies. This study also suggested that drinkers who were highly motivated to control their drinking did not prefer minimal-contact interventions over high-contact interventions.

AB There are few data available on the dynamics of heterosexual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among women whose only risk factor is sexual contact with intravenous drug-using males. Unlike models which rely on unconfirmed estimates regarding sexual partner selectivity and contact rates between infected and uninfected populations, data from a survey conducted between November 1988 and February 1989 of 1,842 women in New York City provide empirical values for these variables which the authors use in a straightforward estimation model. The authors estimate that the number of new infections among women aged 15-44 years in New York City during 1988 was between 876 and 1,668 and that the number of women already infected through heterosexual contact with male intravenous drug users is between 5,390 and 10,230 among the 1,844,285 women in this age group. These conclusions indicate that male-to-female transmission in New York City is of substantial magnitude and that prevention efforts among male intravenous drug users and their female sexual partners must be appropriately directed.

AB Students from several rural, Southwestern schools rated family, television, teachers and doctors as the most important of 11 sources of information about various health topics.  However, doctors were only the fifth-ranked source of information about sex and reproduction and the seventh-ranked source of information about drugs, with friends being the fourth- and third-ranked sources of information about these two more personal and sensitive topics.  American Indians reported even stronger reliance on doctors than did Hispanic and Anglo students, and rated clinic nurses as much more important sources of health information than did the other two ethnic groups.  Females showed greater reliance on social sources and less on electronic media than did male students, and high school students relied more on print media and less on television, nurses and family than did younger children.  Students felt more knowledgeable about smoking, alcohol and exercise than about diet, the heart-blood system and cancer; however, American Indians felt less informed about smoking and alcohol than did Anglos or Hispanics.  These findings (especially when compared to previous results) suggest that effective health education programs must be tailored to particular populations and based on specific knowledge of their attitudes, behavior and environment.

Every sexually abused child was evaluated for each of five modes of HIV transmission, and in nine children the pathway was identified. Four of the study children acquired HIV from child sexual abuse and in six, abuse was a possible source. Transmission by child sexual abuse was the most frequent of the proven modes of acquisition of HIV in this population. The other proven modes of acquisition were vertical transmission (n = 3) and HIV-contaminated blood transfusion (n = 2). Twelve males were identified (n = 8) or suspected (n = 4) of being perpetrators. Three knew themselves to have HIV at the time of an assault and eight were aware that the child had HIV at the time of an assault. There was no indication from any child that "safe sex" precautions had been observed. Children with HIV infection had multiple risk factors for abuse or neglect. The sociological descriptors of the lives of the 14 abused children showed multiple known risk factors for sexual abuse that also overlapped with known risk factors for or sequelae of the acquisition of HIV infection. These included drug abuse and alcoholism in the home, prostitution of a parent, lack of parenting, poverty, and chronic illness of the child. Prevention efforts should recognize that children as well as adults are at risk for sexually transmitted HIV infection.

The United Way of Horry County (UWHC) operates in this manner, and over the years they have raised a significant amount of funds to support local service agencies. The UWHC is now attempting to examine possible changes by embarking upon a study designed to measure among the public the degree of awareness of United Way and the services which they provide. A sample survey was conducted and data were collected via telephone solicitation from individuals selected randomly throughout the market area of Horry County. The study identified the four most important services as: emergency assistance such as housing, fire, flood, etc., senior citizens, health care services, and drug and alcohol abuse. Furthermore, the study indicated that services which need to be added to this list include AIDS research, aid for homeless, mentally ill, and elderly.

AB Women infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) via a sexual relationship with an infected drug using partner are the second largest group of women diagnosed with AIDS in this country. Since 1983, they have been the most rapidly growing subgroup of adults with AIDS, and the increase has been even more rapid among black and hispanic women. Because they are a diverse group and are not readily identified, women partners of drug users and their needs have been unknown to or neglected by service providers and programs that could help them avoid becoming infected. More complete understanding of their characteristics and needs can help in the development of sensitive educational, preventative, and therapeutic strategies to help slow the dramatically increasing burden of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality among them and their families. 
A2 Women who acquired HIV from their IV drug user sexual partners make up
   the 2nd largest group of women with AIDS in the US.  By May 1991,k more
   than 3600 women had AIDS due to sexual intercourse with an IV drug user.
   Yet this is a low estimate because women partners of IV drug users are
   not visible and either do not know or want to know about their sexual
   partners drug use, but women partners of IV drug users constitute the
   fastest growing subgroup of adults with AIDS since 1983.  The rise is
   particularly quick among black and hispanic women.  They come from all
   racial, ethnic, and social group and tend to abuse alcohol and drugs but
   not usually IV drugs.  Those in urban areas tend to be of reproductive
   age, have children, and are poor.  Due to their diversity and their
   relative invisibility, service providers and programs that can help them
   avoid acquiring HIV infection either cannot identify them or their needs
   or they neglect them.  The most successful HIV prevention programs are
   those designed and managed by women peers.  HIV prevention programs
   based in drug treatment programs used by the women's partners and in
   AIDS-related programs have not been successful.  Prevention messages
   geared towards women have tended to focus on condom usage and prevention
   of HIV transmission to infants without considering their social and
   psychological needs.  They need prevention methods which they can
   control.  Use of existing methods (e.g., asking a partner to use a
   condom) may result in various reactions such as sexual rejection and
   domestic violence.  Thus providers must become more familiar with their
   characteristics and needs to develop sensitive educational, preventive,
   and therapeutic approaches to reduce the burden of AIDS-related sickness
   and death among women partners of IV drug users and their families.

AB A sample of 1023 eighth and tenth grade students in small to medium-sized central Texas school districts was assessed to determine the amount of information they receive from ten sources about six categories of drugs. The amount of information males reported receiving about each drug category was significantly greater than what females reported, and the amount of information that eighth graders reported receiving about each drug category was significantly greater than what tenth graders reported. Television was the primary source of drug information for all categories of drugs except inhalants, for which friends and television were equally important sources. Parents and printed media (magazines or newspapers) were of secondary importance, followed by friends and teachers. Adolescents were less likely to receive drug-related information from experience, siblings, church, doctors, and police. The reliance on the mass media for drug information in smaller school districts is a pattern which has been previously observed in larger urban districts. This consistency suggests that mass media approaches to drug education are likely to be as effective in rural areas and smaller towns as they are among urban adolescents. Implications for television programming are discussed.

A2 Evidence suggest that AIDS prevention messages are not getting through 
   and that people continue to deny the threat of AIDS, developments that 
   underscore the importance of credible messengers.  Evidence suggests 
   that myths and misconceptions about AIDS remain common around the 
   world. Even in the US, a 1/3 of the population continues to believe 
   that the virus can be transmitted through casual contact.  Although 
   complicated and contradictory messages are partly to blame for the 
   confusion, denial remains one of the greatest obstacles to AIDS 
   prevention.  Many people -- especially young people -- simply believe
   that AIDS cannot affect them. In order to overcome this barrier, 
   effective messengers are needed, and 2 of the most effective ones are 
   people with AIDS (PWAs) and "insider" messengers.  As Richard Rector, a 
   34-year-old Californian with AIDS, explains, PWAs have learned to live 
   with the disease, and some have been able to transcend it.  Thus, they 
   are able to help people overcome their fear.  PWAs humanize the 
   education process.  Programs that involve PWAs have been used to 
   educate young people in many countries, including the US, Brazil, 
   Kenya, and Zambia.  Another effective messenger is the insider, himself 
   or herself a member of the target group.  The use of an insider is 
   particularly effective when the target group in question faces stigma 
   or harassment, groups such as prostitutes and drug users. In Ghana, an 
   AIDS education campaign recruited female prostitutes to serve as 
   educators and to distribute condoms.  3 months into the project, condom 
   use among prostitutes had increased from 13% to 94%.  The effectiveness 
   of both strategies is that the education process is not didactic but 
   participatory.

AB Alcohol use has become normative for adolescents in most developed and developing countries, with serious health implications. In response to this problem, the World Health Organization convened a group of investigators in 1985 from centres in four countries--Australia, Chile, Norway and Swaziland--to participate in a pilot study on the efficacy of the social influences approach in school-based alcohol education. The goal of the educational programme was to delay onset and minimize involvement of alcohol use among 13-14 year-old adolescents. 25 schools in the 4 countries, representing middle- and lower-class populations, were randomly assigned to peer-led education, teacher-led education or a control condition. The programme focused on the social and environmental influences to drink alcohol, and skills to resist those influences. It consisted of 5 lessons over 2 months. Baseline and post-test data measured alcohol-use knowledge, attitudes, skills and friends' drinking patterns. Data were collected immediately prior to and 2 months following the educational programme. The data converge on the finding that peer-led education appears to be efficacious in reducing alcohol use across a variety of settings and cultures.

AB Physicians can play an important role in society's response to alcohol problems. In diagnosis, alcohol problems among patients are frequently overlooked. Physicians should routinely ask patients about alcohol intake. In light of evidence on the effectiveness of brief interventions, especially with heavy-drinking but nondependent patients, physicians' treatment efforts should be focused in this direction. Patients who are alcohol dependent might best be treated by nonphysicians. Research contributions of physicians should be concentrated on topics for which physician input is needed: longitudinal studies of health consequences, factors contributing to mortality and health service costs, biochemical markers of alcohol use and basic pharmacology. Strong evidence links population alcohol consumption levels to overall harm. Therefore, prevention efforts should be aimed at the population as well as at people who may be at risk. Physicians can contribute to these efforts by influencing public policy and by setting healthy examples in their own alcohol use.

AB This study examines the relationship of alcohol consumption and self-reported lifetime prevalence of hypertension among 19,284 non-institutionalized civilians in the United States. Cross-sectional data from the 1983 National Health Interview Survey, a national probability sample, were examined for each sex separately. Women who report hypertension consumed significantly less alcohol than women who did not report hypertension. Self-reported hypertensive men consumed equal or greater amounts of alcohol than self-reported normotensive men. Alcohol consumption was significantly associated with greater risk of hypertension among men, but not among women. After controlling for other risk factors significant effects for hypertension were found among males who on average consumed more than one drink/day. Beer consumption and spirits consumption above three drinks/day were significant predictors of male hypertension after adjustment for the confounding effects of other alcoholic beverage consumption and other risk factors. This study suggests that alcohol consumption by men who know that they are hypertensive is an important public health concern, with policy implications for targeting prevention efforts.

AB Data from 606 (75.8%) undergraduate respondents drawn from a random sample (N = 800) at Rutgers University demonstrate that, although fewer college students may be drinking when compared to some previous estimates, there is still a large number of heavy drinkers. In addition, traditional demographic variables continue to predict alcohol consumption levels. Students also report a similar variety of drinking related problems as in previous college drinking studies. Women constitute half as many heavy drinkers as men, but report an equal amount of alcohol-related problems in this sample. When controlling for race, it appears that white students continue to drink the most, and show heavy drinking rates comparable to a previous large college sample in the northeast. Students who live on campus drink more than their commuting counterparts, and the drinking age has little effect on consumption levels or total reported alcohol-related problems, although it alters the context of drinking somewhat. Findings are generally compared to previous as well as more recent college drinking data. Sex differences and similarities are discussed, as well as the findings concerning legal drinking status. Implications for prevention efforts are suggested.

The Israeli study used a set of 64 magazine alcohol advertisements from 10 countries and with the help of an open-ended questionnaire examined differences and similarities in the perception of Israeli and foreign advertisements by Jewish, Moslem, Druze and Christian teenagers. Each response was coded twice. The first code indicated the general tone of the response and the second code indicated its theme. The article presents selected general results and conclusions. The results have implications for designing alcohol abuse education messages and can aid alcohol advertisers interested in responsible advertising to find advertising standards suitable to each culture.

AB Suicide is a major public health problem among adolescents. Although the event is rare, and rates have stabilized and even shown slight reduction in recent years, suicide has nevertheless become the second leading cause of morbidity among youths aged 15 to 24, which is otherwise a robust and relatively disease-free population. Although research on predictive factors has yielded increasingly sensitive indices of who the high-risk adolescent might be, the inherent difficulty of predicting rare events from common ones has made sensitive and specific prediction most elusive. Current neurobiologic research holds promise for the use of biologic markers in the identification of high-risk adolescents, and pharmacologic research may yield further advances in the treatment of affectively disordered youths. At this point, the most promising approaches to treating adolescent suicide appear to be (1) treatment of disorders antecedent to suicide crises, such as depression, substance abuse, family conflict, and conduct disturbance, and (2) prevention efforts targeting known high-risk groups, such as affectively disordered young men with accompanying alcohol and drug involvement and other antisocial behavior.

Many American business leaders believe that the media can help to reduce drug use, and they have supported a nationwide effort to highlight the dangers of illicit drug use on the airwaves and in newspapers and magazines. This article considers the efficacy of media-based efforts to prevent adolescent drug use. Selected theories and research are reviewed, and suggestions are made for integrating social and behavioral theory and research into media prevention strategies. The authors conclude that scientists and interventionists could do much to improve on current research and development in this prevention arena, within the limits of what is possible to achieve through mass communications as presently constituted in the United States.

Second, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is defined in terms of the opportunities it represents for substance abuse prevention. Third, a variety of barriers are described that must be addressed if the potential of CAI for enhancing substance abuse prevention efforts is ever to be realized. Finally, recommendations are made for coordinating research and development efforts, now and in the future, so that the potential of new technology for improving substance abuse prevention efforts will be adequately evaluated.

The intention was to estimate how likely Australia is to experience an epidemic of cocaine use if the availability of the drug was to increase. A sample of 499 young adults in which illicit drug users were overrepresented were surveyed. The results suggested that there was not a large untapped market for cocaine. In terms of risk and attraction, cocaine was perceived to be more like the traditional 'hard drugs' of heroin, stimulants and hallucinogens than the traditional 'soft drugs' of alcohol and marijuana. Only 5% of the sample were prepared to try cocaine if offered it by a close friend.

AB Previous investigations with adolescents (aged 12-19) have shown alcohol-related expectancies to develop in childhood prior to significant drinking experience and to covary directly with drinking behavior. To chart the development of alcohol expectancies in children as young as age 6, a procedure was developed to be as independent as possible of age-related variation in reading and language development. This instrument was administered to 114 elementary school children of both genders, distributed across grades 1 to 5. Psychometric analysis provided evidence of the test's reliability and validity. Evaluation of the developmental pattern produced two primary findings: (1) there was an overall trend of increasingly positive expectancies with age; and (2) strikingly, the bulk of the increase was observed in the third and fourth grades. Children's expectancies may be less differentiated than adolescent or adult expectancies. These findings suggest that the precursors for later alcohol use and abuse are formed in childhood and that prevention efforts may need to begin as early as third grade.

AB Analysis of significant trends in self-reported alcohol consumption by women is presented, using data from surveys carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in three Australian States: Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales. Three indices of alcohol consumption were used to characterize consumption in 1977 and subsequently in 1983 or 1985. Little change was observed in the proportion of women who consumed alcohol in the previous week, although significant increases were recorded in the average daily consumption of female drinkers in all three States. These overall increases reflect increased levels of consumption by younger women. Women aged 18-24 years in all three States, as well as those aged 25-44 years in South Australia, consumed more alcohol in the later survey than did women of the same ages in 1977. The proportion of younger female drinkers whose average daily consumption reached hazardous levels showed marked increases in all three States. Analysis of beverage choices in Western Australia and South Australia indicated that older women in both States were consuming significantly less beer, and that South Australian women aged 25-64 years were consuming less fortified wine than were women of the same ages in 1977. These decreases were overshadowed by significant increases in wine consumption in both States for all age groups, and by increasing spirits' consumption in the 18-24 year olds. Several sources of underestimation of consumption are cited. Observed trends are discussed in the light of changing social values, alcohol marketing strategies and the employment status of women. Likely short- and long-term consequences of the observed consumption patterns are predicted and the challenge to prevention strategies is highlighted.

Local officials worked with the Public Health Service's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, to educate and inform the public about the workshop recommendations as well as other alcohol-related concerns, and to encourage public involvement in their communities with the issue of alcohol-impaired driving and other alcohol-related concerns. With minimal assistance from Federal agencies and Washington-based health and public interest groups, the communities developed unique approaches to generating local television, radio, and newspaper coverage of an event that had originated as national news. The events demonstrated that, with minimal Federal resources and support, local groups can create media attention in conjunction with national news, and local media events can lead to successful community activism. The techniques can be applied by other community groups to gain sufficient news media attention to encourage the public to organize around issues of common concern.

AB Despite the dangers, many drivers continue to take risks when driving. This paper outlines an explanation of this risk-taking behavior and the failure of numerous fear-arousing messages to change the manner in which many people drive. Being an occupant in a car and learning to drive may be seen as analogous to systemic desensitization and flooding procedures, in which fear is extinguished and/or a response inconsistent with fear is learned. Once this procedure is complete the fear response is unlikely to be reinstated by messages pointing out possible dangers on the road, because the situations in which the messages are received are usually inappropriate, and many believe that they are superior drivers and therefore not at risk. News presentation of the huge road toll and multiple fatality crashes may only confirm to many people that they are better than average drivers since so many other people have been killed or seriously injured, and they, the superior drivers, have not. A prediction of this account is that driving confidence will increase with increasing age, through the greater on-road fear-reducing experience and increased exposure to the road toll. This prediction was examined in surveys of 2,963 Australian drivers, conducted as part of the evaluation of random breath testing. Respondents were asked to rate their ability as drivers compared with average, and to rate their ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. The overconfidence observed in Canada, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United States was identified in Australian drivers. The predicted increase in confidence with increasing age was supported up to the age of 40 years, after which confidence changed little. Confidence in ability to drive after consuming alcohol increased steadily with age. Finally, it was predicted that the introduction of random breath testing and the associated media campaign partly about the effects of alcohol (which was successful in reducing the road toll) would decrease confidence in ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. Comparison of survey data before and after the introduction of random breath testing did not support this prediction.

AB An analysis of national data was completed to assess historical trends in age differences regarding incidents of accidental, homicidal, and suicidal deaths of children and adolescents. Analyses were completed on data for 1979 and 1984 examining gender * age and race * age differences using raw frequencies, ratios of death to size of living cohort, and percentage of a given form of death to all deaths. Historical trends reveal a general decline in incidents of the three leading external causes of death. Males were at greater risk than females in both 1979 and 1984. Age difference comparisons reveal greatest increase in incidence occurs between early and middle adolescence with continuing increases into late adolescence. Implications for prevention and intervention are made. Speculation based on a gender intensification hypothesis is advanced for observed gender differences. Racial differences are discussed from a socio-contextual perspective. Age differences are thought to be bio-socially related, while historical trend differences may be due to cohort size differences, cultural change, or prevention efforts due to changes in age of majority laws (e.g., drinking).

AB Advertisements in magazines read by 12% or more of college students enrolled in an introductory nutrition class were surveyed for hidden food and nutrition messages. Meanings were identified by categories of activities, products, and people. Less than 10% of the ads featuring people fell into food categories. Of these, more were for alcohol and supplements; fewer were for basic or extra-calorie foods. Hidden messages for females could imply beauty through fashion products, beauty aids, and supplements but with a nutrition slimming plan. Males may be receiving a subtle message that food choices do not matter, and that alcohol and supplements are desirable in everyday life.

AB In this paper we present data on the HIV-related risks for adolescents growing up in an area where injecting drug use is prevalent and HIV infection has been identified among local injecting drug users. We report on young peoples' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of drug use and injectors; HIV and AIDS; sex, safer sex and condom use. These adolescents had an extensive and practically oriented knowledge of illicit drugs and drug injectors. The majority of adolescents contacted had an unsophisticated but approximate understanding of HIV transmission dynamics and how to guard against infection. Our data suggest that many adolescents find issues relating to sex awkward, embarrassing and difficult subjects for discussion. In a final section we consider some of the policy implications of our work focussing in particular on the prevention of injecting, the promotion of condom use, and the necessity of avoiding a focus upon risk groups. 
A2 A study was conducted of adolescents in close contact with groups at
   high risk of HIV infection for information on their knowledge,
   attitudes, and perceptions regarding drug use and intravenous (IV) drug
   use, HIV and AIDS, sex, safer sex, and condoms.  The study was
   implemented out of concern over the heterosexual transmission of HIV
   between IV-drug users and their non-injecting sex partners. 
   Specifically, youths largely between ages 14-16 from a squalid inner
   city section Northwest of Glasgow formed the target population under
   investigation.  Since a large number of youths have initiated IV-drug
   use since 1981, and HIV infection has already been identified among
   local users, this area was an appropriate locale to study HIV-related
   risks for adolescents growing up where IV drug use is prevalent.  
   Semi-structured interviews, group interviews, street interviews, and
   direct observation were employed mainly among adolescents in a Catholic
   school, a non-denominational school, a community center, and an
   intermediate treatment (IT) social work group to gain pertinent study
   answers.  64 in-school students of both sexes in group discussions over
   a 2-month period formed the bulk of the sample, while an informal
   approach of a more random nature was used at the community center.  Only
   5 girls were involved from the IT group.  The youths demonstrated an
   extensive, current knowledge of illicit drugs and IV-drug users in the
   community.  Virtually all interviewed personally knew an IV-drug user. 
   The majority also had an approximate understanding of HIV transmission
   dynamics and how to protect themselves, albeit with a certain degree of
   misinformation and confusion.  Sex issues were generally difficult to
   broach and discuss, with most adolescents feeling awkward and
   embarrassed.  Health education programs must be more broadly based to
   include outside contacts of high risk groups.   Locally-targeted,
   school-based classes and campaigns led by health professionals and ex-IV
   users may be most appropriate and effective in communicating HIV
   infection prevention messages, clarifying misconceptions of transmission
   dynamics, dissuading IV-drug experimentation and use, and gaining
   acceptance for negotiating safer sex practices among sexually active
   youths.  Moreover, attitudinal gender differences between boys and girls
   toward relationships and condoms should be recognized, with
   consideration given to designing educational campaigns according to sex.

AB The use of smokeless tobacco appears to be a socially acceptable behavior among certain ethnic and cultural groups in developing and developed countries. Some native groups in the Northwest Territories have traditionally used smokeless tobacco. With the visits of the merchant supply ships to the Northwest Territories in the early 1950's, a wider commercial variety of smokeless tobacco began to be used. Of great concern is the generation of Canadian children and adolescents who start this habit and become addicted to smokeless tobacco during their primary and secondary school years. Smokeless tobacco is reemerging as a popular form of tobacco among children and adolescents in Canada, the United States (including Alaska), Scandinavia and Britain. Chemical analysis of samples of smokeless tobacco from six countries has revealed that moist snuff obtained in 1985, from Gjoa Haven, Northwest Territories (imported from the United States) had the highest levels of cancer causing tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA) of 228,400 and 240,100 parts per billion. If these levels were found in any other consumer product today, it would be banned from the marketplace. Because of their known carcinogenicity, the United States Department of Agriculture and Federal Food and Drug Administration have set up strict tolerance levels for human exposure to these chemicals and they prohibit the sale of beer, bacon or baby bottle nipples that contain levels greater than 10 parts per billion. TSNA concentrations in snuff exceed the levels of nitrosamines in other consumer products by over one hundredfold. During snuff dipping or chewing tobacco, the nitrosation process continues within the mouth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB In recent years leading authorities and organizations have been recommending policies to combat alcohol abuse. These policies range from restrictions on availability to curbs on drinking and driving. However, the policies have not been presented in any priority order, nor is it clear how acceptable they will be to the general public. This report sets out public opinion on 21 key policies and looks at recent changes in public support in this area. It shows that there are a wide range of policies on alcohol which are well supported by the general public. It seems that the vast majority of both drinkers and non-drinkers would like to see more detailed labelling on alcoholic drinks, further action in the area of drinking and driving, the promotion of alternatives to alcohol in pubs, a levy on alcohol advertising, bans on the sale of alcohol at a variety of sports meetings, more alcohol education in schools and stricter enforcement of the laws on under-age drinking. In addition, the survey reveals greater public support for restrictions on the promotion of alcohol and the introduction of random breath testing, than had been found one year previously. It is suggested that these findings could be used for setting an agenda on the implementation of policies to reduce alcohol abuse.

AB This paper presents an overview of theoretical perspectives applicable to the effects of television drinking portrayals on adolescent audiences, focusing on the influence of beer and wine advertising and entertainment depictions of drinking behavior. A critical review of survey research evidence indicates that alcohol commercials contribute to a modest increase in overall consumption by teenagers and may have a slight impact on alcohol misuse and drunk driving. There are no studies measuring the effects of entertainment programming on adolescents, but content analyses suggest the potential for increased prodrinking attitudes and behaviors. Policy implications for addressing the deleterious effects of televised drinking are discussed, and priorities for future research are identified.

AB Throughout the study group deliberations, there were issues that cross-cut all discussions and suggestions. While the focus of the conference was on television, it is not possible to talk about television without including advertising, cable, and independent stations as well as the networks. In addition, television cannot be discussed in isolation from movies, for with VCRs and television reruns, movies are an integral part of the television scene. A second theme that transcended most discussion was a reluctance to call upon external regulatory mechanisms to control what many see as the excesses of television. There was sensitivity and concern for striking a balance between safeguarding basic freedoms, on one hand, and assuring the health and well being of the nation on the other. In terms of specific recommendations, there were some key general agreements: 1. Need for Interdisciplinary Dialog. Repeatedly, concern was voiced on how little understanding there is among and between those who are primarily concerned with the health and development of young people and those who develop programs viewed by that population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB During a period of 2 1/2 years, every 3 months 221 different food items forming a "market basket" were purchased, prepared, and classified into 23 food commodity groups. The "market basket" was based on a study of the dietary intake of 18-year-old men. In the (homogenized) food groups, the contents of protein, fat, and available carbohydrates were determined as well as the fatty acid composition. The mean daily amounts of the macrocomponents (as a percentage of the mean daily energy value of the total diet) were 14% for protein, 35% for fat, 47% for total available carbohydrates, and 4% for alcohol. The total diet contained 24 gm dietary fiber. The fatty acid composition of the Dutch male adolescents' diet resembles the fatty acid composition of the Dutch "national diet" and the typical American diet: approximately 15% of total calories as saturated fatty acids, 5% as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and a polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio of 0.33. The results, as compared with the recommendations for a healthy diet, show that a decreased consumption of saturated fat, a higher consumption of PUFA, a higher dietary fiber intake, and a higher consumption of complex carbohydrates would be advisable for male Dutch adolescents.

AB A random telephone survey was conducted in a suburban community in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to assess the perceptions of parents about teenage drinking and driving. A total of 807 completed interviews were conducted. The results indicated that while most parents viewed teen drinking (69%) and drinking and driving (65%) to be a prevalent, relatively few seem to be engaging in behaviors likely to influence this. Thirty-two percent said they never discuss drinking and driving with their children, and over 65% said they never talk to other parents about how to talk to their children about drinking and driving, nor have any interest in doing so. Although slightly more than half said they had family policies concerning drinking, less than 20% said there were penalties for violating these policies. Over 70% expressed their willingness to watch a special show on TV about how parents can talk to their children about alcohol. Parents of teenagers appear to be far more likely to think that their teen's friends drink and drive (36%) than they are to think that their teen drinks and drives (10%). The results of this survey indicate a significant lack of parental awareness of teen drinking and a denial of their own teen's involvement in it.
