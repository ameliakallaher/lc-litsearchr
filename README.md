We would like to acknowledge and thank Clarke Lakovakis for allowing us to use his Introduction to R guide while developing this course.

The guide accompanied the first day of instruction for his course at the 2019 FORCE11 Scholarly Communications Institute: “AM4 - Working with Scholarly Literature in R: Pulling, Wrangling, Cleaning, and Analyzing Structured Bibliographic Metadata.” It covers the essentials of what R is.
