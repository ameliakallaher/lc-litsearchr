## Developing a good naive search

-- notes on choosing precise search terms, goal is not high recall
-- assume familiarity with PICO and its variants
-- assign work in small groups to recreate an existing review?
-- allow individual too based on expertise?
-- would be good to have an actual benchmark to test against
? could use this to get data for sensitivity analysis on naive search quality
? 10 minutes to generate a search for existing SR?
? mass testing precision and recall
? save all naive searches, expert score + PRESS for sensitivity
