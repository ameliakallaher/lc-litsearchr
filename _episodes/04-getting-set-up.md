# Getting set up
You will need to create and set up your working directory in RStudio for this lesson. The working directory is very important, as it is the place where you will store, save, and retrieve your files. RStudio projects makes it easy to set up your working directory.

If for some reason your working directory is not set up correctly you can change it in the RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser where your working directory should be, and clicking on the blue gear icon "More", and select "Set As Working Directory". Alternatively you can use `setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to reset your working directory.

> ## Exercise
> Let's create a new project for this lesson.
>
> Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then `New project`
>
> Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory"), for example `litsearchr-lesson`, and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/library-carpentry`)
>
> Click on `Create project`
>
> Create a new file where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > Rscript. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as "`script.R`".

## Organize your working directory
Using consistent filing naming and folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized. It will also make it easy to find things in the future since systematic reviews typically take months to complete. This can be especially helpful when you are working on multiple reviews or checking in with a review team months after running the initial search. In general, you can create directories or folders for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**. 

> ## Exercise 
> For this lesson, we will create the following folders in your working directory:
>
> `search_results_data/`
> Use this folder to store your raw data or the original files you export from a bibliographic database. For the sake of transparency and [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts, rather than manually) as possible.
> `search_results_data_output/` 
> When you need to modify your raw data for your analyses, it might be useful to store the modified versions of the datasets generated by your scripts in a different folder.
> `documents/` 
> This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other text.
> `scripts/`
> This would be the location to keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting.
>
> You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory for this lesson.
>
> We can create these folders using the RStudio interface by clicking on the "New Folder" button in the file pane (bottom right), or directly from R by typing in the console. Practice doing both when setting up your folders for this lesson.

> ## Download the data for this lesson
> For this lesson we will be using a small dataset of references from a published systematic review on alcohol advertising and teens.
>
> Go to the Figshare page for this curriculum, (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12417554.v1), and download the dataset called "`anderson_refs.csv`". 
>
{: .callout}

> ## Exercise 
>
> You can import a csv directly into RStudio with this line of script
>
~~~
read.csv("Path where your CSV file is located on your computer\\File Name.csv")
~~~
>
> To try this locate where you downloaded the dataset on your computer. Save the csv file to your desktop. Once saved, locate the file on your desktop and right click on it with your mouse. Select "Properties". To determine the location path you'll need for this script look at "Location". You may want to copy & paste or write this location down to reference later.
>
> Now, try reading in the anderson.refs.csv into RStudio. Remember, my path may look different from yours. Modify the path name to reflect where the csv file is stored on your compter.
>
~~~
read.csv("C:\\Users\\aak98\\Desktop\\anderson_refs.csv", header = TRUE)
~~~
> Notice that I also set the header to ‘TRUE’ as our dataset in the CSV file contains a header.
>
> Also note that the double backslash (‘\\’) within the path name. By adding double backslash you can avoid the following error in R
~~~
Error: ‘\U’ used without hex digits in character string starting “”C:\U”
~~~
> This is one workaround that you may apply in R to bypass this type of error.
>
> What if you want to import a text file into R?
>
> For a text file, you only need to change the file extension from csv to txt (at the end of the path). The path name would look like this
~~~
read.csv("C:\\Users\\aak98\\Desktop\\anderson_refs.txt", header = TRUE)
~~~
> You can also place downloaded files directly in the `search_results_data` folder you just created in your working directory. To do this you would open your computer's downloads folder, locate the file you just downloaded ("`anderson_refs`"), and drag and drop it into your newly created R Project folder ("`search_results_data`").
